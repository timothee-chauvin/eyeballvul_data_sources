  "summary": "HSTS double free",
  "details": "libcurl supports sharing HSTS data between separate \"handles\". This sharing\nwas introduced without considerations for doing this sharing across separate\nthreads but there was no indication of this fact in the documentation.\n\nDue to missing mutexes or thread locks, two threads sharing the same HSTS data\ncould end up doing a double free or use after free.",
