  "summary": ".netrc parser out-of-bounds access",
  "details": "curl can be told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file ends\nin a line with consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curl could\nread past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the read works, write a\nzero byte possibly beyond its boundary.\n\nThis will in most cases cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might\nalso cause different outcomes.\n\nIf a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or\notherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-of-service.",
