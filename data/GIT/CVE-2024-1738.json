  "id": "CVE-2024-1738",
  "details": "An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the evaluations.get route in the evaluations API endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve the results of any organization's evaluation by simply knowing the evaluation ID, due to the lack of project ID verification in the SQL query. As a result, attackers can gain access to potentially private data contained within the evaluation results.",
