  "summary": "SOCKS5 heap buffer overflow",
  "details": "This flaw makes curl overflow a heap based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxy\nhandshake.\n\nWhen curl is asked to pass along the hostname to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow\nthat to resolve the address instead of it getting done by curl itself, the\nmaximum length that hostname can be is 255 bytes.\n\nIf the hostname is detected to be longer than 255 bytes, curl switches to\nlocal name resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only to the\nproxy. Due to a bug, the local variable that means \"let the host resolve the\nname\" could get the wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary\nto the intention, copy the too long hostname to the target buffer instead of\ncopying just the resolved address there.",
