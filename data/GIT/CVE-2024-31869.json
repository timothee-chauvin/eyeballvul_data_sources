  "id": "CVE-2024-31869",
  "details": "Airflow versions 2.7.0 through 2.8.4 have a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to see sensitive provider configuration via the \"configuration\" UI page\u00a0when \"non-sensitive-only\" was set as \"webserver.expose_config\" configuration (The celery provider is the only community provider currently that has sensitive configurations). You should migrate to Airflow 2.9 or change your \"expose_config\" configuration to False as a workaround. This is similar, but different to  CVE-2023-46288 https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9qqg-mh7c-chfq  which concerned API, not UI configuration page.",
