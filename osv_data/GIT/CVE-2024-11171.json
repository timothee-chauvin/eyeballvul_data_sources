The application uses multer middleware for handling multipart file uploads. When using in-memory storage (the default setting for multer), there is no limit on the upload file size. This can lead to a server crash due to out-of-memory errors when handling large files. An attacker without any privileges can exploit this vulnerability to cause a complete denial of service. The issue is fixed in version 0.7.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/danny-avila/librechat","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bb58a2d0662ef86dc75a9d2f6560125c018e3836"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-11171.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/91717a5a-d653-4e35-b186-9e8d00aa4285"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/danny-avila/librechat/commit/bb58a2d0662ef86dc75a9d2f6560125c018e3836"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
