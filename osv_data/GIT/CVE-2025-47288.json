Prior to version 0.1.1, if there was a policy posted to a public topic that was tied to a private group then the group members could be shown to non-group members. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.1. A workaround involves moving any policy topics with private groups to restricted categories.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-policy","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6b4390fe486408cc86ccea6b091406cfac6c5b8f"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-47288.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/47xxx/CVE-2025-47288.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-policy/commit/6b4390fe486408cc86ccea6b091406cfac6c5b8f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-policy/security/advisories/GHSA-jc5r-rm2j-mh4x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47288"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/47xxx/CVE-2025-47288.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
