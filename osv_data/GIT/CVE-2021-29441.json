In Nacos before version 1.4.1, when configured to use authentication (-Dnacos.core.auth.enabled=true) Nacos uses the AuthFilter servlet filter to enforce authentication. This filter has a backdoor that enables Nacos servers to bypass this filter and therefore skip authentication checks. This mechanism relies on the user-agent HTTP header so it can be easily spoofed. This issue may allow any user to carry out any administrative tasks on the Nacos server.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/alibaba/nacos","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1d88d5d773c46912957a15cb6e78bd8b01c89fde"}]}],"versions":["0.2.1","0.2.1-RC1","0.3.0","0.3.0-RC1","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.7.0","0.8.0","0.8.0-SNAPSHOT","0.9.0","1.0.0","1.0.0-RC1","1.0.0-RC2","1.0.0-RC3","1.0.1","1.1.0","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.2.0","1.2.0-beta.0","1.2.0-beta.1","1.2.1","1.3.0","1.3.0-beta","1.3.1","1.3.1-beta","1.3.2","1.4.0","2.0.0-ALPHA.2","v0.1.0","v0.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-29441.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-36hp-jr8h-556f"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/4701"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/4703"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
