  "details": "An issue was discovered in the /api/connector endpoint handler in Yubico yubihsm-connector before 3.0.1 (in YubiHSM SDK before 2021.04). The handler did not validate the length of the request, which can lead to a state where yubihsm-connector becomes stuck in a loop waiting for the YubiHSM to send it data, preventing any further operations until the yubihsm-connector is restarted. An attacker can send 0, 1, or 2 bytes to trigger this.",
