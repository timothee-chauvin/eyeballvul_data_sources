{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-28484","published":"2021-04-14T18:15:14Z","modified":"2025-10-21T06:05:04.033044Z","aliases":["GHSA-8m9g-647g-5pxw"],"details":"An issue was discovered in the /api/connector endpoint handler in Yubico yubihsm-connector before 3.0.1 (in YubiHSM SDK before 2021.04). The handler did not validate the length of the request, which can lead to a state where yubihsm-connector becomes stuck in a loop waiting for the YubiHSM to send it data, preventing any further operations until the yubihsm-connector is restarted. An attacker can send 0, 1, or 2 bytes to trigger this.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/yubico/yubihsm-connector","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"58717c35fb39ba5e9a4c950a7479a4464ca4ee2f"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.1.0","2.2.0","3.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-28484.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Yubico/yubihsm-connector/releases"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2021-02/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/B7Q2KGXSPQEEONAWMFZRVH2TXWX3QPCQ/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
