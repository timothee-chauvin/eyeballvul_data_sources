{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-30211","published":"2025-03-28T14:55:47Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:46:48.093393Z","aliases":["GHSA-vvr3-fjhh-cfwc"],"related":["SUSE-SU-2025:1356-1"],"summary":"KEX init error results with excessive memory usage","details":"Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. Prior to versions OTP-27.3.1, 26.2.5.10, and 25.3.2.19, a maliciously formed KEX init message can result with high memory usage. Implementation does not verify RFC specified limits on algorithm names (64 characters) provided in KEX init message. Big KEX init packet may lead to inefficient processing of the error data. As a result, large amount of memory will be allocated for processing malicious data. Versions OTP-27.3.1, OTP-26.2.5.10, and OTP-25.3.2.19 fix the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may set option `parallel_login` to `false` and/or reduce the `max_sessions` option.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/erlang/otp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"76266a91989378ce53159eee4bd16773e248f5f3"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/erlang/otp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f607645b971572b03f9f45551b1804f41fac8fa7"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/erlang/otp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6cbc096a58ace1904a42944be1b6e89c4f59cc18"}]}],"versions":["OTP-17.0","OTP-17.0.1","OTP-17.0.2","OTP-17.1","OTP-17.1.1","OTP-17.1.2","OTP-17.2","OTP-17.2.1","OTP-17.2.2","OTP-17.3","OTP-17.3.1","OTP-17.3.2","OTP-17.3.3","OTP-17.3.4","OTP-17.4","OTP-17.4.1","OTP-17.5","OTP-17.5.1","OTP-17.5.2","OTP-17.5.3","OTP-17.5.4","OTP-17.5.5","OTP-17.5.6","OTP-17.5.6.1","OTP-17.5.6.10","OTP-17.5.6.2","OTP-17.5.6.3","OTP-17.5.6.4","OTP-17.5.6.5","OTP-17.5.6.6","OTP-17.5.6.7","OTP-17.5.6.8","OTP-17.5.6.9","OTP-18.0","OTP-18.0-rc1","OTP-18.0-rc2","OTP-18.0.1","OTP-18.0.2","OTP-18.0.3","OTP-18.1","OTP-18.1.1","OTP-18.1.2","OTP-18.1.3","OTP-18.1.4","OTP-18.1.5","OTP-18.2","OTP-18.2.1","OTP-18.2.2","OTP-18.2.3","OTP-18.2.4","OTP-18.2.4.0.1","OTP-18.2.4.1","OTP-18.3","OTP-18.3.1","OTP-18.3.2","OTP-18.3.3","OTP-18.3.4","OTP-18.3.4.1","OTP-18.3.4.1.1","OTP-18.3.4.10","OTP-18.3.4.11","OTP-18.3.4.2","OTP-18.3.4.3","OTP-18.3.4.4","OTP-18.3.4.5","OTP-18.3.4.6","OTP-18.3.4.7","OTP-18.3.4.8","OTP-18.3.4.9","OTP-19.0","OTP-19.0-rc1","OTP-19.0-rc2","OTP-19.0.1","OTP-19.0.2","OTP-19.0.3","OTP-19.0.4","OTP-19.0.5","OTP-19.0.6","OTP-19.0.7","OTP-19.1","OTP-19.1.1","OTP-19.1.2","OTP-19.1.3","OTP-19.1.4","OTP-19.1.5","OTP-19.1.6","OTP-19.1.6.1","OTP-19.2","OTP-19.2.1","OTP-19.2.2","OTP-19.2.3","OTP-19.2.3.1","OTP-19.3","OTP-19.3.1","OTP-19.3.2","OTP-19.3.3","OTP-19.3.4","OTP-19.3.5","OTP-19.3.6","OTP-19.3.6.1","OTP-19.3.6.10","OTP-19.3.6.11","OTP-19.3.6.12","OTP-19.3.6.13","OTP-19.3.6.2","OTP-19.3.6.3","OTP-19.3.6.4","OTP-19.3.6.5","OTP-19.3.6.6","OTP-19.3.6.7","OTP-19.3.6.8","OTP-19.3.6.9","OTP-20.0","OTP-20.0-rc1","OTP-20.0-rc2","OTP-20.0.1","OTP-20.0.2","OTP-20.0.3","OTP-20.0.4","OTP-20.0.5","OTP-20.1","OTP-20.1.1","OTP-20.1.2","OTP-20.1.3","OTP-20.1.4","OTP-20.1.5","OTP-20.1.6","OTP-20.1.7","OTP-20.1.7.1","OTP-20.2","OTP-20.2.0.1","OTP-20.2.1","OTP-20.2.2","OTP-20.2.3","OTP-20.2.4","OTP-20.3","OTP-20.3.1","OTP-20.3.2","OTP-20.3.2.1","OTP-20.3.3","OTP-20.3.4","OTP-20.3.5","OTP-20.3.6","OTP-20.3.7","OTP-20.3.8","OTP-20.3.8.1","OTP-20.3.8.10","OTP-20.3.8.11","OTP-20.3.8.12","OTP-20.3.8.13","OTP-20.3.8.14","OTP-20.3.8.15","OTP-20.3.8.16","OTP-20.3.8.17","OTP-20.3.8.18","OTP-20.3.8.19","OTP-20.3.8.2","OTP-20.3.8.20","OTP-20.3.8.21","OTP-20.3.8.22","OTP-20.3.8.23","OTP-20.3.8.24","OTP-20.3.8.25","OTP-20.3.8.26","OTP-20.3.8.3","OTP-20.3.8.4","OTP-20.3.8.5","OTP-20.3.8.6","OTP-20.3.8.7","OTP-20.3.8.8","OTP-20.3.8.9","OTP-21.0","OTP-21.0-rc1","OTP-21.0-rc2","OTP-21.0.1","OTP-21.0.2","OTP-21.0.3","OTP-21.0.4","OTP-21.0.5","OTP-21.0.6","OTP-21.0.7","OTP-21.0.8","OTP-21.0.9","OTP-21.1","OTP-21.1.1","OTP-21.1.2","OTP-21.1.3","OTP-21.1.4","OTP-21.2","OTP-21.2.1","OTP-21.2.2","OTP-21.2.3","OTP-21.2.4","OTP-21.2.5","OTP-21.2.6","OTP-21.2.7","OTP-21.3","OTP-21.3.1","OTP-21.3.2","OTP-21.3.3","OTP-21.3.4","OTP-21.3.5","OTP-21.3.6","OTP-21.3.7","OTP-21.3.7.1","OTP-21.3.8","OTP-21.3.8.1","OTP-21.3.8.10","OTP-21.3.8.11","OTP-21.3.8.12","OTP-21.3.8.13","OTP-21.3.8.14","OTP-21.3.8.15","OTP-21.3.8.16","OTP-21.3.8.17","OTP-21.3.8.18","OTP-21.3.8.19","OTP-21.3.8.2","OTP-21.3.8.20","OTP-21.3.8.21","OTP-21.3.8.22","OTP-21.3.8.23","OTP-21.3.8.24","OTP-21.3.8.3","OTP-21.3.8.4","OTP-21.3.8.5","OTP-21.3.8.6","OTP-21.3.8.7","OTP-21.3.8.8","OTP-21.3.8.9","OTP-22.0","OTP-22.0-rc1","OTP-22.0-rc2","OTP-22.0-rc3","OTP-22.0.1","OTP-22.0.2","OTP-22.0.3","OTP-22.0.4","OTP-22.0.5","OTP-22.0.6","OTP-22.0.7","OTP-22.1","OTP-22.1.1","OTP-22.1.2","OTP-22.1.3","OTP-22.1.4","OTP-22.1.5","OTP-22.1.6","OTP-22.1.7","OTP-22.1.8","OTP-22.1.8.1","OTP-22.2","OTP-22.2.1","OTP-22.2.2","OTP-22.2.3","OTP-22.2.4","OTP-22.2.5","OTP-22.2.6","OTP-22.2.7","OTP-22.2.8","OTP-22.3","OTP-22.3.1","OTP-22.3.2","OTP-22.3.3","OTP-22.3.4","OTP-22.3.4.1","OTP-22.3.4.10","OTP-22.3.4.11","OTP-22.3.4.12","OTP-22.3.4.12.1","OTP-22.3.4.13","OTP-22.3.4.14","OTP-22.3.4.15","OTP-22.3.4.16","OTP-22.3.4.17","OTP-22.3.4.18","OTP-22.3.4.19","OTP-22.3.4.2","OTP-22.3.4.20","OTP-22.3.4.21","OTP-22.3.4.22","OTP-22.3.4.23","OTP-22.3.4.24","OTP-22.3.4.25","OTP-22.3.4.26","OTP-22.3.4.27","OTP-22.3.4.3","OTP-22.3.4.4","OTP-22.3.4.5","OTP-22.3.4.6","OTP-22.3.4.7","OTP-22.3.4.8","OTP-22.3.4.9","OTP-23.0","OTP-23.0-rc1","OTP-23.0-rc2","OTP-23.0-rc3","OTP-23.0.1","OTP-23.0.2","OTP-23.0.3","OTP-23.0.4","OTP-23.1","OTP-23.1.1","OTP-23.1.2","OTP-23.1.3","OTP-23.1.4","OTP-23.1.4.1","OTP-23.1.5","OTP-23.2","OTP-23.2.1","OTP-23.2.2","OTP-23.2.3","OTP-23.2.4","OTP-23.2.5","OTP-23.2.6","OTP-23.2.7","OTP-23.2.7.1","OTP-23.2.7.2","OTP-23.2.7.3","OTP-23.2.7.4","OTP-23.2.7.5","OTP-23.3","OTP-23.3.1","OTP-23.3.2","OTP-23.3.3","OTP-23.3.4","OTP-23.3.4.1","OT
