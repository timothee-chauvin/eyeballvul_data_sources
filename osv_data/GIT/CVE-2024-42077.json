This however does\nnot take into account that the IO could be arbitrarily large and can\ncontain arbitrary number of extents.\n\nExtent tree manipulations do often extend the current transaction but not\nin all of the cases.  For example if we have only single block extents in\nthe tree, ocfs2_mark_extent_written() will end up calling\nocfs2_replace_extent_rec() all the time and we will never extend the\ncurrent transaction and eventually exhaust all the transaction credits if\nthe IO contains many single block extents.  Once that happens a\nWARN_ON(jbd2_handle_buffer_credits(handle) <= 0) is triggered in\njbd2_journal_dirty_metadata() and subsequently OCFS2 aborts in response to\nthis error.  This was actually triggered by one of our customers on a\nheavily fragmented OCFS2 filesystem.\n\nTo fix the issue make sure the transaction always has enough credits for\none extent insert before each call of ocfs2_mark_extent_written().\n\nHeming Zhao said:\n\n------\nPANIC: \"Kernel panic - not syncing: OCFS2: (device dm-1): panic forced after error\"\n\nPID: xxx  TASK: xxxx  CPU: 5
