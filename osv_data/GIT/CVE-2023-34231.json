Prior to version 1.6.19, a command injection vulnerability exists in the Snowflake Golang driver via single sign-on (SSO) browser URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user’s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. A patch is available in version 1.6.19.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d04e9aad8c13a649b6d347f4ee87d227c15f5e0c"}]}],"versions":["0.1","0.2","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.5.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.10","v1.1.11","v1.1.12","v1.1.13","v1.1.14","v1.1.15","v1.1.16","v1.1.17","v1.1.18","v1.1.19","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.1.8","v1.1.9","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.10","v1.3.13","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.10","v1.6.11","v1.6.12","v1.6.13","v1.6.14","v1.6.15","v1.6.16","v1.6.17","v1.6.18","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.6.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-34231.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/34xxx/CVE-2023-34231.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/commit/e11a2a555f1b9f7adc1f01fb7b5e7f38fbbb2a1c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/pull/757"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/security/advisories/GHSA-fwv2-65wh-2w8c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34231"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-77"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/34xxx/CVE-2023-34231.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
