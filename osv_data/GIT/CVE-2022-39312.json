Dataease prior to 1.15.2 has a deserialization vulnerability. In Dataease, the Mysql data source in the data source function can customize the JDBC connection parameters and the Mysql server target to be connected. In `backend/src/main/java/io/dataease/provider/datasource/JdbcProvider.java`, the `MysqlConfiguration` class does not filter any parameters. If an attacker adds some parameters to a JDBC url and connects to a malicious mysql server, the attacker can trigger the mysql jdbc deserialization vulnerability. Through the deserialization vulnerability, the attacker can execute system commands and obtain server privileges. Version 1.15.2 contains a patch for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dataease/dataease","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6c3a011955c5c753ffd616d030bea5db4793c51c"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39312.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/dataease/dataease/security/advisories/GHSA-q4qq-jhjv-7rh2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/dataease/dataease/commit/956ee2d6c9e81349a60aef435efc046888e10a6d"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/dataease/dataease/pull/3328"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dataease/dataease/releases/tag/v1.15.2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20","CWE-502"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
