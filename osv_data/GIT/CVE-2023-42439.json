A SSRF vulnerability exists starting in version 3.2.0, bypassing existing controls on the software. This can allow a user to request internal services for a full read SSRF, returning any data from the internal network. The application is using a whitelist, but the whitelist can be bypassed. The bypass will trick the application that the first host is a whitelisted address, but the browser will use `@` or `%40` as a credential to the host geoserver on port 8080, this will return the data to that host on the response. Version 4.1.3.post1 is the first available version that contains a patch.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/geonode/geonode","events":[{"introduced":"d120dfe19303bf73e384352c2c1913993b2bff72"},{"fixed":"a5002cad67e4148aa0822f32626096379783c96a"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-42439.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/security/advisories/GHSA-pxg5-h34r-7q8p"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/commit/79ac6e70419c2e0261548bed91c159b54ff35b8d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/releases/tag/4.1.3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
