{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-25198","published":"2025-02-12T17:46:06.491Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:34:27.086247Z","aliases":["GHSA-3mvx-qw4r-fcqf"],"summary":"mailcow: dockerized vulnerable to password reset poisoning","details":"mailcow: dockerized is an open source groupware/email suite based on docker. Prior to version 2025-01a, a vulnerability in mailcow's password reset functionality allows an attacker to manipulate the `Host HTTP` header to generate a password reset link pointing to an attacker-controlled domain. This can lead to account takeover if a user clicks the poisoned link. Version 2025-01a contains a patch. As a workaround, deactivate the password reset functionality by clearing `Notification email sender` and `Notification email subject` under System -> Configuration -> Options -> Password Settings.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"120366fec7b9ea79c9f563a81fa5ea30321ab0b2"}]}],"versions":["2022-01","2022-01a","2022-03","2022-03a","2022-04","2022-05","2022-05a","2022-05b","2022-05c","2022-05d","2022-06","2022-06a","2022-06b","2022-07","2022-07a","2022-08","2022-08a","2022-08b","2022-09","2022-09a","2022-10","2022-10a","2022-11","2022-11a","2022-11b","2022-12","2022-12a","2022-12b","2023-01","2023-01a","2023-02","2023-02a","2023-03","2023-04","2023-04a","2023-04b","2023-05","2023-05a","2023-07","2023-07a","2023-08","2023-09","2023-10","2023-10a","2023-11","2023-11a","2023-12","2023-12a","2024-01","2024-01a","2024-01b","2024-01c","2024-01d","2024-01e","2024-02","2024-04","2024-06","2024-06a","2024-06b","2024-06c","2024-07","2024-08","2024-08a","2024-11","2024-11a","2024-11b","2025-01"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-25198.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/security/advisories/GHSA-3mvx-qw4r-fcqf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N"}]}
