[1]\n\nDo the following steps can reproduce this BUG:\nmount -t ocfs2 /dev/vdc /mnt/ocfs2\ncp testfile /mnt/ocfs2/\n./link-cp /mnt/ocfs2/testfile /mnt/ocfs2/testfile.1\numount /mnt/ocfs2\n\nThen umount will fail, and it outputs:\numount: /mnt/ocfs2: target is busy.\n\nWhile tracing umount, it blames mnt_get_count() not return as expected.\nDo a deep investigation for fget()/fput() on related code flow, I've\nfinally found that fget() leaks since ocfs2 doesn't support nowait\nbuffered read.\n\nio_issue_sqe\n|-io_assign_file  // do fget() first\n  |-io_read\n  |-io_iter_do_read\n    |-ocfs2_file_read_iter  // return -EOPNOTSUPP\n  |-kiocb_done\n    |-io_rw_done\n      |-__io_complete_rw_common  // set REQ_F_REISSUE\n    |-io_resubmit_prep\n      |-io_req_prep_async  // override req->file, leak happens\n\nThis was introduced by commit a196c78b5443 in v5.18.
