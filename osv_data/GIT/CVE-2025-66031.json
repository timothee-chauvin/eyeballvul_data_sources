An Uncontrolled Recursion vulnerability in node-forge versions 1.3.1 and below enables remote, unauthenticated attackers to craft deep ASN.1 structures that trigger unbounded recursive parsing. This leads to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) via stack exhaustion when parsing untrusted DER inputs. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"235ad3e70e4fdfdca4fdeb662dfba6588e2c38bd"}]}],"versions":["0.1.10","0.1.11","0.1.12","0.1.13","0.1.14","0.1.15","0.1.2","0.1.3","0.1.4","0.1.5","0.1.6","0.1.7","0.1.8","0.1.9","0.10.0","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.10","0.2.11","0.2.12","0.2.13","0.2.14","0.2.15","0.2.17","0.2.18","0.2.19","0.2.2","0.2.20","0.2.21","0.2.22","0.2.23","0.2.24","0.2.25","0.2.26","0.2.27","0.2.28","0.2.29","0.2.3","0.2.30","0.2.31","0.2.32","0.2.33","0.2.34","0.2.35","0.2.36","0.2.37","0.2.4","0.2.5","0.2.6","0.2.7","0.2.8","0.2.9","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.4.3","0.5.1","0.5.2","0.5.3","0.5.4","0.5.5","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.10","0.6.11","0.6.12","0.6.13","0.6.14","0.6.16","0.6.17","0.6.18","0.6.19","0.6.2","0.6.20","0.6.21","0.6.22","0.6.23","0.6.24","0.6.25","0.6.26","0.6.27","0.6.28","0.6.29","0.6.3","0.6.30","0.6.31","0.6.32","0.6.33","0.6.34","0.6.35","0.6.37","0.6.38","0.6.39","0.6.4","0.6.40","0.6.41","0.6.42","0.6.43","0.6.44","0.6.45","0.6.46","0.6.5","0.6.6","0.6.7","0.6.8","0.6.9","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.7.3","0.7.4","0.7.5","0.7.6","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.8.2","0.8.3","0.8.4","0.8.5","0.9.0","0.9.1","0.9.2","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66031.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/260425c6167a38aae038697132483b5517b26451"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-554w-wpv2-vw27"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-674"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
