This may cause other calls on the list to disappear if a race\noccurs.\n\nFix this by taking the client_call_lock when removing a call from whatever\nlist its ->wait_link happens to be on.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9d35d880e0e4a3ab32d8c12f9e4d76198aadd42d"},{"fixed":"996a7208dadbf2cdda8d51444d5ee1fdd1ccbc92"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9d35d880e0e4a3ab32d8c12f9e4d76198aadd42d"},{"fixed":"b1fdb0bb3b6513f5bd26f92369fd6ac1a2422d8b"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9d35d880e0e4a3ab32d8c12f9e4d76198aadd42d"},{"fixed":"fc9de52de38f656399d2ce40f7349a6b5f86e787"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.11.1","v6.11.2","v6.11.3","v6.11.4","v6.11.5","v6.11.6","v6.11.7","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.5","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.59","v6.6.6","v6.6.60","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-50294.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.61"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.11.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-50294.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/996a7208dadbf2cdda8d51444d5ee1fdd1ccbc92"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b1fdb0bb3b6513f5bd26f92369fd6ac1a2422d8b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fc9de52de38f656399d2ce40f7349a6b5f86e787"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
