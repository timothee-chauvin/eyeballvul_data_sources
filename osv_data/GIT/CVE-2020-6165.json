{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2020-6165","published":"2020-07-15T21:15:13.583Z","modified":"2025-12-07T10:00:38.762143Z","aliases":["BIT-silverstripe-2020-6165","GHSA-589q-75r3-mfq4"],"details":"SilverStripe 4.5.0 allows attackers to read certain records that should not have been placed into a result set. This affects silverstripe/recipe-cms. The automatic permission-checking mechanism in the silverstripe/graphql module does not provide complete protection against lists that are limited (e.g., through pagination), resulting in records that should have failed a permission check being added to the final result set. GraphQL endpoints are configured by default (e.g., for assets), but the admin/graphql endpoint is access protected by default. This limits the vulnerability to all authenticated users, including those with limited permissions (e.g., where viewing records exposed through admin/graphql requires administrator permissions). However, if custom GraphQL endpoints have been configured for a specific implementation (usually under /graphql), this vulnerability could also be exploited through unauthenticated requests. This vulnerability only applies to reading records; it does not allow unauthorised changing of records.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-cms","events":[{"introduced":"d8915115f837633fb9183bbd66b05a2238606e19"},{"fixed":"dd0163ae000a85e6bf76b96b76c261a211b05047"}]}],"versions":["3.1.15","3.1.16","3.1.16-rc1","3.1.17","3.1.17-rc1","3.1.17-rc2","3.1.18","3.1.18-rc1","3.1.18-rc2","3.1.19-rc1","3.2.0","3.2.0-rc2","3.2.1","3.2.1-rc1","3.2.1-rc2","3.2.2","3.2.2-rc1","3.2.2-rc2","3.2.3","3.2.3-rc1","3.2.3-rc2","3.2.4-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-6165.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework","events":[{"introduced":"0092792568fb8a33674669aa200c7c81b163a365"},{"fixed":"cfb3d96a0352d3de96d05fabb8f3980129df6355"}]}],"versions":["3.1.15","3.1.16","3.1.16-rc1","3.1.17","3.1.17-rc1","3.1.17-rc2","3.1.18","3.1.18-rc1","3.1.18-rc2","3.1.19-rc1","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.1-rc1","3.2.1-rc2","3.2.2","3.2.2-rc1","3.2.2-rc2","3.2.3","3.2.3-rc1","3.2.3-rc2","3.2.4-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-6165.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2020-6165"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
