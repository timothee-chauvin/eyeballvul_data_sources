Querybook's datadocs functionality works by using a Websocket Server. The client talks to this WSS whenever updating/deleting/reading any cells as well as for watching the live status of query executions. Currently the CORS setting allows all origins, which could result in cross-site websocket hijacking and allow attackers to read/edit/remove datadocs of the user. This issue has been addressed in version 3.32.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pinterest/querybook","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3e992eea99411a75aeb6eb41fe60100b0e6afb59"}]}],"versions":["v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v3.14.2","v3.28.0","v3.31.1","v3.31.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-28251.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/security/advisories/GHSA-5349-j4c9-x767"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/pull/1425"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-345"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
