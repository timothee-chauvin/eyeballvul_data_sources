The flaw is due to inadequate bounds checking when copying 'Content-Length' and 'Warning' headers into fixed-size buffers in the sip_validate_packet and sip_parse_extra_headers functions within src/sip.c. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) via crafted SIP messages.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/irontec/sngrep","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"373abb90804ba71f980c7120e62f90d3a5c81213"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.0","v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.10","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.4.7","v1.4.8","v1.4.9","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-3120.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/irontec/sngrep/releases/tag/v1.8.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://pentraze.com/vulnerability-reports/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/irontec/sngrep/pull/480/commits/f229a5d31b0be6a6cc3ab4cd9bfa4a1b5c5714c6"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
