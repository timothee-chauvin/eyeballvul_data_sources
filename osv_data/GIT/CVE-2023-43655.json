Users publishing a composer.phar to a public web-accessible server where the composer.phar can be executed as a php file may be subject to a remote code execution vulnerability if PHP also has `register_argc_argv` enabled in php.ini. Versions 2.6.4, 2.2.22 and 1.10.27 patch this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make sure `register_argc_argv` is disabled in php.ini, and avoid publishing composer.phar to the web as this is not best practice.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/composer/composer","events":[{"introduced":"378b34c5e33c71d194f33e1b73a62ba22148ff13"},{"fixed":"fedc76ee3f3e3d57d20993b9f4c5fcfb2f8596aa"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.0"},{"fixed":"2.2.22"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/composer/composer","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f8f49191eec76f039b466aa1f161406fe43aff50"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.10.27"}]}}],"versions":["1.0.0-alpha10","1.0.0-alpha9","1.10.24","1.10.25","1.10.26"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-43655.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/43xxx/CVE-2023-43655.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/4fce14795aba98e40b6c4f5047305aba17a6120d"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/955a48e6319c8962e5cd421b07c00ab3c728968c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/95e091c921037b7b6564942845e7b738f6b95c9c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/security/advisories/GHSA-jm6m-4632-36hf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00030.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/66H2WKFUO255T3BZTL72TNYJYH2XM5FG/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7AWYAUZNH565NWPIKGEIYBWHYNM5JGAE/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KFOPGPW2KS37O3KJWBRGTUWHTXCQXBS2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43655"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-74"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/43xxx/CVE-2023-43655.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
