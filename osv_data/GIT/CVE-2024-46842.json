The issue is that for MBX_TIMEOUT cases, when firmware\nreturns SFP information at a later time, that same mailbox memory region\nreferences previously freed memory in its cmpl routine.\n\nFix by adding checks for the MBX_TIMEOUT return code.  During mailbox\nresource cleanup, check the mbox flag to make sure that the wait did not\ntimeout.  If the MBOX_WAKE flag is not set, then do not free the resources\nbecause it will be freed when firmware completes the mailbox at a later\ntime in its cmpl routine.\n\nAlso, increase the timeout from 30 to 60 seconds to accommodate boot\nscripts requiring longer timeouts.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"479b0917e4477f49df2e3be454aac3cfa5dec171"},{"fixed":"bba47fe3b038cca3d3ebd799665ce69d6d273b58"},{"fixed":"ede596b1434b57c0b3fd5c02b326efe5c54f6e48"}]}],"versions":["v6.1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.10.1","v6.10.2","v6.10.3","v6.10.4","v6.10.5","v6.10.6","v6.10.7","v6.10.8","v6.10.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-46842.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.10.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-46842.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bba47fe3b038cca3d3ebd799665ce69d6d273b58"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ede596b1434b57c0b3fd5c02b326efe5c54f6e48"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/46xxx/CVE-2024-46842.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46842"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/46xxx/CVE-2024-46842.json"}}
