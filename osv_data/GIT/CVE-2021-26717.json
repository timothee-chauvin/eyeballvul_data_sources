When re-negotiating for T.38, if the initial remote response was delayed just enough, Asterisk would send both audio and T.38 in the SDP. If this happened, and the remote responded with a declined T.38 stream, then Asterisk would crash.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"a65908f83e2f17a3aca7eb39c8e06045aca02674"},{"fixed":"3cd8afbdf2c6dffe80c631a5336e21bb1827a5cd"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-26717.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/161471/Asterisk-Project-Security-Advisory-AST-2021-002.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Feb/58"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2021-002.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-29203"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
