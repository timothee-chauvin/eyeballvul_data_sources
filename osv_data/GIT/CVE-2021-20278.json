When RBAC is enabled, Kiali assumes that some of the token validation is handled by the underlying cluster. When OpenID `implicit flow` is used with RBAC turned off, this token validation doesn't occur, and this allows a malicious user to bypass the authentication.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kiali/kiali","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1f8fdfee3a794b856c5aa0b4771db2646c109fe8"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0.Alpha","0.2.0.Alpha","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.17.0","v0.18.0","v0.19.0","v0.20.0","v0.21.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.17.0","v1.18.0","v1.19.0","v1.2.0","v1.20.0","v1.21.0","v1.22.0","v1.23.0","v1.24.0","v1.25.0","v1.26.0","v1.27.0","v1.28.0","v1.29.0","v1.3.0","v1.30.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-20278.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1937171"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://kiali.io/news/security-bulletins/kiali-security-002/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
