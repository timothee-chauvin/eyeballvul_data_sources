This crash happens when\nthe packet type is extracted for a SKB. This extraction\nwhich is present in the received msdu delivery path,is\nnot needed for the monitor ring packets since they are\nall RAW packets. Hence appending the flags with\n\"RX_FLAG_ONLY_MONITOR\" to skip that extraction.\n\nObserved calltrace:\n\nUnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address\n0000000000000064\nMem abort info:\n  ESR = 0x0000000096000004\n  EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n  SET = 0, FnV = 0\n  EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n  FSC = 0x04: level 0 translation fault\nData abort info:\n  ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000004\n  CM = 0, WnR = 0\nuser pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000048517000\n[0000000000000064] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000\nInternal error: Oops: 0000000096000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\nModules linked in: ath11k_pci ath11k qmi_helpers\nCPU: 2 PID: 1781 Comm: napi/-271 Not tainted\n6.1.0-rc5-wt-ath-656295-gef907406320c-dirty #6\nHardware name: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
