GoCD versions 19.11.0 through 21.4.0 (inclusive) are vulnerable to a Document Object Model (DOM)-based cross-site scripting attack via a pipeline run's Stage Details > Graphs tab. It is possible for a malicious script on a attacker-hosted site to execute script that will run within the user's browser context and GoCD session via abuse of a messaging channel used for communication between with the parent page and the stage details graph's iframe. This could allow an attacker to steal a GoCD user's session cookies and/or execute malicious code in the user's context. This issue is fixed in GoCD 22.1.0. There are currently no known workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gocd/gocd","events":[{"introduced":"c532a61bb240ffbe59fe356445bea6433005563f"},{"fixed":"f4c9c1650e2e27fe0a9962faa39536f94f57e297"}]}],"versions":["19.11.0","19.12.0","20.1.0","20.10.0","20.2.0","20.3.0","20.4.0","20.5.0","20.6.0","20.7.0","20.8.0","20.9.0","21.1.0","21.2.0","21.3.0","21.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-29182.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/29xxx/CVE-2022-29182.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/10190/commits/a256d05de1445e6c77843f098581fc6a66fe4477"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/gocd/gocd/releases/tag/22.1.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-qcg6-4q44-3589"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29182"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.gocd.org/releases/#22-1-0"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/29xxx/CVE-2022-29182.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
