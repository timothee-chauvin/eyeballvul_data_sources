Both are not enabled by default in Spring Framework nor Spring Boot, however, when MappingJackson2JsonView is configured in an application, JSONP support is automatically ready to use through the \"jsonp\" and \"callback\" JSONP parameters, enabling cross-domain requests.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8dab9416c7381a477c5b5f94da421da9eb976735"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-11040.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/04/msg00022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-11040"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2019-5072813.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
