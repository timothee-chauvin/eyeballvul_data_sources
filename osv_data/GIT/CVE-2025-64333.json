{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-64333","published":"2025-11-26T22:57:02.640Z","modified":"2025-11-28T19:48:54.608597Z","aliases":["GHSA-537h-xxmx-v87m"],"summary":"Suricata is vulnerable to a stack overflow from big content-type","details":"Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Prior to versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, a large HTTP content type, when logged can cause a stack overflow crashing Suricata. This issue has been patched in versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. A workaround for this issue involves limiting stream.reassembly.depth to less then half the stack size. Increasing the process stack size makes it less likely the bug will trigger.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"090542709cf620f2053dc03b52ab8aa625dd6eff"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.0.13"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"79db7b1ad444c76530c6eac8702c5e01b7c24a56"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.0.2"}]}}],"versions":["suricata-0.8.2","suricata-1.0.0","suricata-1.0.1","suricata-1.0.2","suricata-1.1","suricata-1.1beta1","suricata-1.1beta2","suricata-1.1beta3","suricata-1.1rc1","suricata-1.2","suricata-1.2.1","suricata-1.2beta1","suricata-1.2rc1","suricata-1.3","suricata-1.3.1","suricata-1.3beta1","suricata-1.3beta2","suricata-1.3rc1","suricata-1.4","suricata-1.4beta1","suricata-1.4beta2","suricata-1.4beta3","suricata-1.4rc1","suricata-2.0","suricata-2.0.1","suricata-2.0.1rc1","suricata-2.0.2","suricata-2.0beta1","suricata-2.0beta2","suricata-2.0rc1","suricata-2.0rc2","suricata-2.0rc3","suricata-2.1beta1","suricata-2.1beta2","suricata-2.1beta3","suricata-2.1beta4","suricata-3.0","suricata-3.0.1","suricata-3.0.1RC1","suricata-3.0RC1","suricata-3.0RC2","suricata-3.0RC3","suricata-3.1","suricata-3.1.1","suricata-3.1.2","suricata-3.1RC1","suricata-3.2","suricata-3.2.1","suricata-3.2RC1","suricata-3.2beta1","suricata-4.0.0","suricata-4.0.0-beta1","suricata-4.0.0-rc1","suricata-4.0.0-rc2","suricata-4.0.1","suricata-4.1.0","suricata-4.1.0-beta1","suricata-4.1.0-rc1","suricata-4.1.0-rc2","suricata-4.1.1","suricata-4.1.2","suricata-5.0.0","suricata-5.0.0-beta1","suricata-5.0.0-rc1","suricata-5.0.1","suricata-6.0.0","suricata-6.0.0-beta1","suricata-6.0.0-rc1","suricata-6.0.1","suricata-7.0.0","suricata-7.0.0-beta1","suricata-7.0.0-rc1","suricata-7.0.0-rc2","suricata-7.0.1","suricata-7.0.10","suricata-7.0.11","suricata-7.0.12","suricata-7.0.2","suricata-7.0.3","suricata-7.0.4","suricata-7.0.5","suricata-7.0.6","suricata-7.0.7","suricata-7.0.8","suricata-7.0.9","suricata-8.0.0","suricata-8.0.0-beta1","suricata-8.0.0-rc1","suricata-8.0.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64333.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-537h-xxmx-v87m"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-121"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
