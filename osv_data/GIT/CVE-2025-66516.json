However, this CVE expands the scope of affected packages in two ways. \n\nFirst, while the entrypoint for the vulnerability was the tika-parser-pdf-module as reported in CVE-2025-54988, the vulnerability and its fix were in tika-core. Users who upgraded the tika-parser-pdf-module but did not upgrade tika-core to >= 3.2.2 would still be vulnerable. \n\nSecond, the original report failed to mention that in the 1.x Tika releases, the PDFParser was in the \"org.apache.tika:tika-parsers\" module.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/tika","events":[{"introduced":"386b68b5ae87beafacfb63f33e0a9888dedb9c30"},{"fixed":"c5c9d00e475d48226dfe3f80a2891bfa5426043a"}]}],"versions":["1.13","1.13-rc1","1.14","1.14-rc1","1.15","1.15-rc1","1.16","1.17","2.0.0","2.0.0-ALPHA","2.0.0-BETA","2.1.0","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.5.0","2.6.0","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.9.0","3.0.0","3.0.0-BETA","3.0.0-BETA2","3.1.0","3.2.0","3.2.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66516.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54988"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/s5x3k93nhbkqzztp1olxotoyjpdlps9k"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
