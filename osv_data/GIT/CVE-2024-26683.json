This was in commit c09c4f31998b\n(\"wifi: mac80211: don't connect to an AP while it's in\na CSA process\").\n\nHowever, we promptly got a report that this caused new\nconnection failures, and it turns out that the AP that\nwe now cannot connect to is permanently advertising an\nextended channel switch announcement, even with quiet.\nThe AP in question was an Asus RT-AC53, with firmware\n3.0.0.4.380_10760-g21a5898.\n\nAs a first step, attempt to detect that we're dealing\nwith such a situation, so mac80211 can use this later.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"c09c4f31998bac6d73508e38812518aceb069b68"},{"fixed":"ce112c941c2b172afba3e913a90c380647d53975"},{"fixed":"177fbbcb4ed6b306c1626a277fac3fb1c495a4c7"}]}],"versions":["v6.5","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.7.1","v6.7.2","v6.7.3","v6.7.4","v6.8-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-26683.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.7.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-26683.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/177fbbcb4ed6b306c1626a277fac3fb1c495a4c7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ce112c941c2b172afba3e913a90c380647d53975"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/26xxx/CVE-2024-26683.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26683"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/26xxx/CVE-2024-26683.json"}}
