  "details": "libcurl lets applications specify which specific TLS ciphers to use in\ntransfers, using the option called `CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST`. The cipher\nselection is used for the TLS negotiation when a transfer is done involving\nany of the TLS based transfer protocols libcurl supports, such as HTTPS, FTPS,\nIMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.\n\nDue to a mistake in the code, the selected cipher set was stored in a single\n\"static\" variable in the library, which has the surprising side-effect that if\nan application sets up multiple concurrent transfers, the last one that sets\nthe ciphers accidentally controls the set used by all transfers. In a\nworst-case scenario, this weakens transport security significantly.",
