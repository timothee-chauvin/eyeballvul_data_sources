Prior to 1.11.0-beta.1, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the /admin/config/site endpoint of the Grav application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the data[taxonomies] parameter. The injected payload is stored on the server and automatically executed in the browser of any user who accesses the affected site configuration, resulting in a persistent attack vector. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.11.0-beta.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-admin","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"831fb2641450bfc8ba5f991cdca44c86eb9e58f9"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.4.3","0.5.0","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.2","1.0.0","1.0.0-rc.1","1.0.0-rc.2","1.0.0-rc.3","1.0.0-rc.4","1.0.0-rc.5","1.0.0-rc.6","1.0.0-rc.7","1.0.1","1.0.10","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","1.0.9","1.1.0","1.1.0-beta.1","1.1.0-beta.2","1.1.0-beta.3","1.1.0-beta.4","1.1.0-beta.5","1.1.0-rc.1","1.1.0-rc.2","1.1.0-rc.3","1.1.0-rc.4","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.10.0","1.10.0-beta.1","1.10.0-beta.10","1.10.0-beta.2","1.10.0-beta.3","1.10.0-beta.4","1.10.0-beta.5","1.10.0-beta.6","1.10.0-beta.7","1.10.0-beta.8","1.10.0-beta.9","1.10.0-rc.1","1.10.0-rc.10","1.10.0-rc.11","1.10.0-rc.12","1.10.0-rc.13","1.10.0-rc.14","1.10.0-rc.15","1.10.0-rc.16","1.10.0-rc.17","1.10.0-rc.18","1.10.0-rc.19","1.10.0-rc.2","1.10.0-rc.20","1.10.0-rc.3","1.10.0-rc.4","1.10.0-rc.5","1.10.0-rc.6","1.10.0-rc.7","1.10.0-rc.8","1.10.0-rc.9","1.10.1","1.10.10","1.10.12","1.10.13","1.10.14","1.10.15","1.10.16","1.10.17","1.10.18","1.10.19","1.10.2","1.10.20","1.10.21","1.10.22","1.10.23","1.10.24","1.10.25","1.10.26","1.10.26.1","1.10.27","1.10.28","1.10.29","1.10.3","1.10.30","1.10.30.1","1.10.30.2","1.10.31","1.10.32","1.10.33","1.10.33.1","1.10.34","1.10.35","1.10.36","1.10.37","1.10.37.1","1.10.38","1.10.39","1.10.4","1.10.40","1.10.41","1.10.41.1","1.10.41.2","1.10.42","1.10.43","1.10.44","1.10.45","1.10.46","1.10.47","1.10.48","1.10.49","1.10.49.1","1.10.5","1.10.50","1.10.6","1.10.7","1.10.8","1.10.9","1.2.0","1.2.0-rc.1","1.2.0-rc.2","1.2.1","1.2.10","1.2.11","1.2.12","1.2.13","1.2.14","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.2.5","1.2.5-rc.1","1.2.5-rc.2","1.2.5-rc.3","1.2.5-rc.4","1.2.6","1.2.7","1.2.8","1.2.9","1.3.0","1.3.0-rc.1","1.3.0-rc.2","1.3.0-rc.3","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.5.0","1.5.0-rc.1","1.5.0-rc.2","1.5.0-rc.3","1.5.0-rc.4","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.6.4","1.6.5","1.6.6","1.6.7","1.7.0","1.7.0-beta.1","1.7.0-rc.1","1.7.0-rc.2","1.7.0-rc.3","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.7.3","1.7.4","1.8.0","1.8.1","1.8.10","1.8.11","1.8.12","1.8.13","1.8.14","1.8.15","1.8.16","1.8.17","1.8.18","1.8.19","1.8.2","1.8.20","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.8.6","1.8.7","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.9.0","1.9.0-beta.1","1.9.0-beta.2","1.9.0-beta.3","1.9.0-beta.4","1.9.0-beta.5","1.9.0-beta.6","1.9.0-beta.7","1.9.0-beta.8","1.9.0-rc.1","1.9.0-rc.2","1.9.0-rc.3","1.9.0-rc.4","1.9.1","1.9.10","1.9.11","1.9.12","1.9.13","1.9.14","1.9.15","1.9.16","1.9.17","1.9.18","1.9.19","1.9.2","1.9.3","1.9.4","1.9.5","1.9.6","1.9.7","1.9.8","1.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66308.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66308.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-admin/commit/99f653296504f1d6408510dd2f6f20a45a26f9b0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-gqxx-248x-g29f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66308"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66308.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:A/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
