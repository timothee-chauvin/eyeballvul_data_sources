TX zerocopy should not sense pfmemalloc status","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: TX zerocopy should not sense pfmemalloc status\n\nWe got a recent syzbot report [1] showing a possible misuse\nof pfmemalloc page status in TCP zerocopy paths.\n\nIndeed, for pages coming from user space or other layers,\nusing page_is_pfmemalloc() is moot, and possibly could give\nfalse positives.\n\nThere has been attempts to make page_is_pfmemalloc() more robust,\nbut not using it in the first place in this context is probably better,\nremoving cpu cycles.\n\nNote to stable teams :\n\nYou need to backport 84ce071e38a6 (\"net: introduce\n__skb_fill_page_desc_noacc\") as a prereq.\n\nRace is more probable after commit c07aea3ef4d4\n(\"mm: add a signature in struct page\") because page_is_pfmemalloc()\nis now using low order bit from page->lru.next, which can change\nmore often than page->index.\n\nLow order bit should never be set for lru.next (when used as an anchor\nin LRU list), so KCSAN report is mostly a false positive.\n\nBackporting to older kernel versions seems not necessary.\n\n[1]\nBUG: KCSAN: data-race in lru_add_fn /
