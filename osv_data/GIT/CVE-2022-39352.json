Versions prior to 0.2.5 are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions. You are affected by this vulnerability if you added a tuple with a wildcard (*) assigned to a tupleset relation (the right hand side of a ‘from’ statement). This issue has been patched in version v0.2.5. This update is not backward compatible with any authorization model that uses wildcard on a tupleset relation.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openfga/openfga","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d33a87af80688acdad1225b23e7be6655b323d35"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39352.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-3gfj-fxx4-f22w"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-863"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
