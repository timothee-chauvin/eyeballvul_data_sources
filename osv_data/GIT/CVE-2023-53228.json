However, it's not needed at all, as former commit has integrated\njob cleanup stuff into amdgpu_job_free. Otherwise, because of double\nfree, a NULL pointer dereference will occur in such scenario.\n\nBug: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2457","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"f7d66fb2ea43a3016e78a700a2ca6c77a74579f9"},{"fixed":"c1564d4b105ae535eb3183ecaaa987685b20a888"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"f7d66fb2ea43a3016e78a700a2ca6c77a74579f9"},{"fixed":"ec02a29c3c2ef8ad3e15a0e3f96b99a00e5d97b4"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"f7d66fb2ea43a3016e78a700a2ca6c77a74579f9"},{"fixed":"1253685f0d3eb3eab0bfc4bf15ab341a5f3da0c8"}]}],"versions":["v6.1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.2.1","v6.2.10","v6.2.11","v6.2.12","v6.2.13","v6.2.14","v6.2.15","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4","v6.2.5","v6.2.6","v6.2.7","v6.2.8","v6.2.9","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.3.1","v6.3.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53228.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.16"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.3.0"},{"fixed":"6.3.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53228.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1253685f0d3eb3eab0bfc4bf15ab341a5f3da0c8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c1564d4b105ae535eb3183ecaaa987685b20a888"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ec02a29c3c2ef8ad3e15a0e3f96b99a00e5d97b4"}]}
