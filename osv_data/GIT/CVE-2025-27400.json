Versions prior to 20.12.3 and 20.13.0 contain a vulnerability that allows script execution in the admin panel which could lead to cross-site scripting against authenticated admin users. The attack requires an admin user with configuration access, so in practicality it is not very likely to be useful given that a user with this level of access is probably already a full admin. Versions 20.12.3 and 20.13.0 contain a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openmage/magento-lts","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4c2ef21b973d27ac1d89160610fec63f6436ab46"}]}],"versions":["1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.1.5","1.1.6","1.1.7","1.1.8","1.2.0","1.2.0.1","1.2.0.2","1.2.0.3","1.2.1","1.2.1.1","1.2.1.2","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.1.1","1.3.2","1.3.2.1","1.3.2.2","1.3.2.3","1.3.2.4","1.4.0.0","1.4.0.0-alpha1","1.4.0.0-alpha2","1.4.0.0-alpha3","1.4.0.0-beta1","1.4.0.0-rc1","1.4.0.1","1.4.1.0","1.4.1.1","1.4.2.0","1.5.0.0","1.5.0.0-alpha1","1.5.0.0-alpha2","1.5.0.0-beta1","1.5.0.0-beta2","1.5.0.0-rc1","1.5.0.0-rc2","1.5.0.1","1.5.1.0","1.6.0.0","1.6.0.0-alpha1","1.6.0.0-beta1","1.6.0.0-rc1","1.6.0.0-rc2","1.6.1.0","1.6.1.0-alpha1","1.6.1.0-beta1","1.6.1.0-rc1","1.7.0.0","1.7.0.0-alpha1","1.7.0.0-beta1","1.7.0.0-rc1","1.7.0.1","1.7.0.2","1.8.1.0","1.9.0.0","1.9.0.1","1.9.1.0-lts","1.9.1.1","1.9.2.3","1.9.3.0","1.9.3.1","v19.4.0","v19.4.1","v19.4.10","v19.4.11","v19.4.12","v19.4.13","v19.4.14","v19.4.15","v19.4.16","v19.4.17","v19.4.2","v19.4.3","v19.4.4","v19.4.5","v19.4.6","v19.4.7","v19.4.8","v19.4.9","v20.0.0","v20.0.1","v20.0.10","v20.0.11","v20.0.12","v20.0.13","v20.0.14","v20.0.15","v20.0.16","v20.0.17","v20.0.18","v20.0.2","v20.0.3","v20.0.4","v20.0.5","v20.0.6","v20.0.7","v20.0.8","v20.1.0","v20.1.0-rc1","v20.1.0-rc2","v20.1.0-rc3","v20.1.0-rc4","v20.1.0-rc5","v20.1.0-rc6","v20.1.0-rc7","v20.1.1","v20.10.0","v20.10.1","v20.11.0","v20.12.0","v20.12.1","v20.12.2","v20.2.0","v20.3.0","v20.4.0","v20.5.0","v20.6.0","v20.7.0","v20.8.0","v20.9.0","v21.0.0-beta2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27400.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/commit/d307e5bf75729a2347dde0952fe9fd9fcd9c6aea"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/releases/tag/v20.12.3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/releases/tag/v20.13.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/security/advisories/GHSA-5pxh-89cx-4668"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"}]}
