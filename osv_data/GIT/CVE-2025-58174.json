{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-58174","published":"2025-09-16T16:29:37.615Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:39:44.499722Z","aliases":["GHSA-6gqg-wm9x-5x3m"],"summary":"LAM profile editor stored cross-site scripting vulnerability","details":"LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries stored in an LDAP directory. LAM before 9.3 allows stored cross-site scripting in the Profile section via the profile name field, which renders untrusted input as HTML and executes a supplied script (for example a script element). An authenticated user with permission to create or edit a profile can insert a script payload into the profile name and have it executed when the profile data is viewed in a browser. This issue is fixed in version 9.3. No known workarounds are mentioned.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ldapaccountmanager/lam","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2b05d9df4e343b7ede5d9210c859a9a07e5f6f7e"}]}],"versions":["8.5","8.6","8.6.RC1","8.7","8.7.RC1","8.8","8.8.RC1","8.9","8.9.RC1","9.0","9.0.RC1","9.1","9.1.RC1","9.2","9.2.RC1","9.3.RC1","lam_5_4","lam_5_4_RC1","lam_5_5","lam_5_5_RC1","lam_5_6","lam_5_6_RC1","lam_5_7","lam_5_7_RC1","lam_6_0","lam_6_0_1","lam_6_0_RC1","lam_6_0_RC2","lam_6_1","lam_6_1_RC1","lam_6_2","lam_6_2_1","lam_6_2_RC1","lam_6_3","lam_6_3_RC1","lam_6_4","lam_6_4_RC1","lam_6_5","lam_6_5_RC1","lam_6_6","lam_6_6_RC1","lam_6_7","lam_6_7_RC1","lam_6_8","lam_6_8_RC1","lam_6_9","lam_6_9_RC1","lam_7_0","lam_7_0_RC1","lam_7_1","lam_7_1_RC1","lam_7_2","lam_7_2_RC1","lam_7_3","lam_7_3_RC1","lam_7_4","lam_7_4_RC1","lam_7_5","lam_7_5_RC1","lam_7_6","lam_7_6_RC1","lam_7_7","lam_7_7_RC1","lam_7_8","lam_7_8_RC1","lam_7_9","lam_7_9_1","lam_7_9_RC1","lam_8_0","lam_8_0_1","lam_8_0_RC1","lam_8_1","lam_8_1_RC1","lam_8_2","lam_8_2_RC1","lam_8_3","lam_8_3_RC1","lam_8_4","lam_8_4_RC1","lam_8_5_RC1","untagged-0f11e4b04e249cac51c5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58174.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/security/advisories/GHSA-6gqg-wm9x-5x3m"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
