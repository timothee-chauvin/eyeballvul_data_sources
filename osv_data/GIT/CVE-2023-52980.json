During\nrounds of review and debug, An overflow bug was found\nin ublk driver.\n\nIn ublk_cmd.h, UBLK_MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH is 4096 which means\neach ublk queue depth can be set as large as 4096. But\nwhen setting qd for a ublk device,\nsizeof(struct ublk_queue) + depth * sizeof(struct ublk_io)\nwill be larger than 65535 if qd is larger than 2728.\nThen queue_size is overflowed, and ublk_get_queue()\nreferences a wrong pointer position. The wrong content of\nublk_queue elements will lead to out-of-bounds memory\naccess.\n\nExtend queue_size in ublk_device as \"unsigned int\".","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"71f28f3136aff5890cd56de78abc673f8393cad9"},{"fixed":"ee1e3fe4b4579f856997190a00ea4db0307b4332"},{"fixed":"29baef789c838bd5c02f50c88adbbc6b955aaf61"}]}],"versions":["v5.19","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-52980.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.11"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-52980.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/29baef789c838bd5c02f50c88adbbc6b955aaf61"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ee1e3fe4b4579f856997190a00ea4db0307b4332"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/52xxx/CVE-2023-52980.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52980"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/52xxx/CVE-2023-52980.json"}}
