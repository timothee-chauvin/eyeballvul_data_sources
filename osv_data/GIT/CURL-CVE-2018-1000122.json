  "summary": "RTSP RTP buffer over-read",
  "details": "curl can be tricked into copying data beyond end of its heap based buffer.\n\nWhen asked to transfer an RTSP URL, curl could calculate a wrong data length\nto copy from the read buffer. The `memcpy()` call would copy data from the\nheap following the buffer to a storage area that would subsequently be\ndelivered to the application (if it did not cause a crash). We have managed to\nget it to reach several hundreds bytes out of range.\n\nThis could lead to information leakage or a denial of service for the\napplication if the server offering the RTSP data can trigger this.",
