{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-27408","published":"2025-02-28T17:26:15.196Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:34:16.600736Z","aliases":["GHSA-h8h6-7752-g28c"],"summary":"Manifest Uses a One-Way Hash without a Salt","details":"Manifest offers users a one-file micro back end. Prior to version 4.9.2, Manifest employs a weak password hashing implementation that uses SHA3 without a salt. This exposes user passwords to a higher risk of being cracked if an attacker gains access to the database. Without the use of a salt, identical passwords across multiple users will result in the same hash, making it easier for attackers to identify and exploit patterns, thereby accelerating the cracking process. Version 4.9.2 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mnfst/manifest","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a528afbd3507f4f5e03acd78102f1d5081f89963"}]}],"versions":["0.7.12","0.7.13","0.7.14","0.7.15","0.7.17","0.7.3","0.7.4","0.7.5","0.7.6","0.7.7","0.7.8","0.7.9","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.8.2","0.8.3","0.8.4","0.8.5","0.8.6","0.8.7","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.4","1.0.5","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.4","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","4.0.0-alpha.0","4.0.0-alpha.2","4.0.0-alpha.3","4.0.0-alpha.4","4.0.0-alpha.5","4.0.0-beta","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.0.4","4.0.5","4.0.6","4.1.0","4.1.1","@mnfst/sdk@1.1.0","@mnfst/sdk@1.2.0","add-manifest@1.1.1","manfiest@4.3.0","manifest@4.1.4","manifest@4.1.5","manifest@4.1.6","manifest@4.3.1","manifest@4.3.2","manifest@4.3.3","manifest@4.4.0","manifest@4.5.0","manifest@4.5.1","manifest@4.5.2","manifest@4.5.3","manifest@4.5.4","manifest@4.5.5","manifest@4.6.0","manifest@4.6.1","manifest@4.6.2","manifest@4.7.0","manifest@4.7.1","manifest@4.8.0","manifest@4.8.1","manifest@4.9.0","manifest@4.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27408.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mnfst/manifest/commit/3ed6f1324e96ad469ad929d470dcd0cc386c6c69"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/mnfst/manifest/security/advisories/GHSA-h8h6-7752-g28c"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-759"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
