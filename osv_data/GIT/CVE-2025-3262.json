{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-3262","published":"2025-07-07T10:15:27Z","modified":"2025-10-22T10:14:34.673427Z","aliases":["GHSA-489j-g2vx-39wf"],"details":"A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the huggingface/transformers repository, specifically in version 4.49.0. The vulnerability is due to inefficient regular expression complexity in the `SETTING_RE` variable within the `transformers/commands/chat.py` file. The regex contains repetition groups and non-optimized quantifiers, leading to exponential backtracking when processing 'almost matching' payloads. This can degrade application performance and potentially result in a denial-of-service (DoS) when handling specially crafted input strings. The issue is fixed in version 4.51.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0720e206c6ba28887e4d60ef60a6a089f6c1cc76"}]}],"versions":["0.1.2","0.5.0","1.0","1.1.0","1.2.0","3.0.1","4.3.0.rc1","v0.1.2","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v1.0.0","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.4.0","v3.5.0","v4.0.0-rc-1","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.10.0","v4.11.0","v4.12.0","v4.13.0","v4.14.0","v4.15.0","v4.16.0","v4.2.0","v4.3.0.rc1","v4.33.1","v4.4.0","v4.49.0-AyaVision","v4.49.0-Mistral-3","v4.49.0-SigLIP-2","v4.49.0-SmolVLM-2","v4.5.0","v4.50.3-DeepSeek-3","v4.6.0","v4.7.0","v4.8.0","v4.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-3262.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/ecf5ccc4-39e7-4fb3-b547-14a41d31a184"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/commit/0720e206c6ba28887e4d60ef60a6a089f6c1cc76"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
