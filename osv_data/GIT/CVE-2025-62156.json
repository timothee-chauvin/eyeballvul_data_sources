Versions prior to 3.6.12 and versions 3.7.0 through 3.7.2 contain a Zip Slip path traversal vulnerability in artifact extraction. During artifact extraction the unpack/untar logic (workflow/executor/executor.go) uses filepath.Join(dest, filepath.Clean(header.Name)) without validating that header.Name stays within the intended extraction directory. A malicious archive entry can supply a traversal or absolute path that, after cleaning, overrides the destination directory and causes files to be written outside the /work/tmp extraction path and into system directories such as /etc inside the container. The vulnerability enables arbitrary file creation or overwrite in system configuration locations (for example /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts, /etc/crontab), which can lead to privilege escalation or persistence within the affected container. Update to 3.6.12 or 3.7.3 to remediate the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"18ad5138b6bcb2aba04e00b4ec657bc6b8fad8df"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.12"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows","events":[{"introduced":"d1d689b367c4c8a5a8a095ae60b5d7043f99eda9"},{"fixed":"bded09fe4abd37cb98d7fc81b4c14a6f5034e9ab"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.7.0"},{"fixed":"3.7.3"}]}}],"versions":["ui-v3-rc1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha1","v2.0.0-alpha2","v2.0.0-alpha3","v2.0.0-beta1","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-alpha1","v2.1.0-beta1","v2.1.0-beta2","v2.1.1","v2.10.0-rc1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0-rc1","v2.3.0-rc2","v2.3.0-rc3","v3.1.0-rc1","v3.2.0-rc1","v3.2.0-rc2","v3.2.0-rc3","v3.2.0-rc4","v3.3.0-rc1","v3.3.0-rc2","v3.3.0-rc3","v3.3.0-rc4","v3.3.0-rc5","v3.3.0-rc6","v3.3.0-rc7","v3.3.0-rc8","v3.4.0-rc1","v3.4.0-rc2","v3.4.0-rc3","v3.4.0-rc4","v3.5.0","v3.5.0-rc1","v3.5.0-rc2","v3.6.0","v3.6.0-rc1","v3.6.0-rc2","v3.6.0-rc3","v3.6.0-rc4","v3.6.10","v3.6.11","v3.6.2","v3.6.3","v3.6.4","v3.6.5","v3.6.6","v3.6.7","v3.6.8","v3.6.9","v3.7.0","v3.7.0-rc4","v3.7.1","v3.7.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62156.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-p84v-gxvw-73pf"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/5659ad9b641fcf52c04ed594cd6493f9170f6011"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/9f6bc5d236cd1b24d607943384511d71ad17a4c3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/946a2d6b9ac3309371fe47f49ae94c33ca7d488d/workflow/executor/executor.go#L993"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
