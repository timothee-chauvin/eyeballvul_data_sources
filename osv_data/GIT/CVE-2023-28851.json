Starting in version 0.2.0 and prior to versions 1.0.2, 1.1.0, 2.2.5, and 3.1.1, improper escaping when presenting stored form submissions allowed for an attacker to perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack. The vulnerability was initially patched in version 1.0.2, and version 1.1.0 includes this patch. The bug was then accidentally re-introduced during a merge error, and has been re-patched in versions 2.2.5 and 3.1.1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture","events":[{"introduced":"03a99560d26cb83faf0582de52dad348c3da6026"},{"fixed":"97f974726cf39137c67910befa002cb6e9c8d7a9"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture","events":[{"introduced":"9b6b9f4039f935d73f8b7f99a519f9d90ba6bd6a"},{"fixed":"af71d2711c956d13d6f4efbfdbf6e1e047360f77"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture","events":[{"introduced":"c6c9e0662f9e4812a304d2251e39e351d232be5c"},{"fixed":"5b3aa39dd1eef042f173167b0fa4d3f717971772"}]}],"versions":["0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.3","1.0","1.0.1","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.1.0","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.2.4","3.0.0","3.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-28851.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture/security/advisories/GHSA-38h6-gmr2-j4wx"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture/commit/5b3aa39dd1eef042f173167b0fa4d3f717971772"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79","CWE-80"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
