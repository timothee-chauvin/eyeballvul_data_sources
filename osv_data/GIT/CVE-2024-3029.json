{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-3029","published":"2024-04-16T00:15:11.850Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:35:15.184537Z","details":"In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, an attacker can exploit improper input validation by sending a malformed JSON payload to the '/system/enable-multi-user' endpoint. This triggers an error that is caught by a catch block, which in turn deletes all users and disables the 'multi_user_mode'. The vulnerability allows an attacker to remove all existing users and potentially create a new admin user without requiring a password, leading to unauthorized access and control over the application.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"99cfee1e7025fe9a0919a4d506ba1e1b819f6073"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-3029.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/7189a7a0-9830-459d-b853-bdc2559999a0"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/99cfee1e7025fe9a0919a4d506ba1e1b819f6073"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
