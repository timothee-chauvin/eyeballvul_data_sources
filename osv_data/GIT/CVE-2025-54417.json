Versions 4.13.8 through 4.16.2 and 5.5.8 through 5.8.3 contain a vulnerability that can bypass CVE-2025-23209: \"Craft CMS has a potential RCE with a compromised security key\". To exploit this vulnerability, the project must meet these requirements: have a compromised security key and create an arbitrary file in Craft's /storage/backups folder. With those criteria in place, attackers could create a specific, malicious request to the /updater/restore-db endpoint and execute CLI commands remotely. This issue is fixed in versions 4.16.3 and 5.8.4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/craftcms/cms","events":[{"introduced":"5a47f8acc15201e95063b34b0c3cc4d81b202493"},{"fixed":"964fec5696fd72e4009ca43c646cda90a60adc6c"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"4.13.8"},{"fixed":"4.16.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/craftcms/cms","events":[{"introduced":"dc3ea0cba1f1e60eb32d1dd08c8313eadcc1ebfe"},{"fixed":"f7702ae97d20f0c2d41b97a8fc39ede527579594"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"5.5.8"},{"fixed":"5.8.4"}]}}],"versions":["3.9.14","3.9.15","4.13.10","4.13.8","4.13.9","4.14.0","4.14.0.1","4.14.0.2","4.14.1","4.14.10","4.14.11","4.14.11.1","4.14.12","4.14.13","4.14.14","4.14.15","4.14.2","4.14.3","4.14.4","4.14.5","4.14.6","4.14.7","4.14.8","4.14.8.1","4.14.9","4.15.0","4.15.0-beta.1","4.15.0-beta.2","4.15.0.1","4.15.0.2","4.15.1","4.15.2","4.15.3","4.15.4","4.15.5","4.15.6","4.15.6.1","4.15.6.2","4.15.7","4.16.0","4.16.1","4.16.2","4.16.3","5.5.10","5.5.8","5.5.9","5.6.0","5.6.0.1","5.6.0.2","5.6.1","5.6.10","5.6.10.1","5.6.10.2","5.6.11","5.6.12","5.6.13","5.6.14","5.6.15","5.6.16","5.6.17","5.6.2","5.6.3","5.6.4","5.6.5","5.6.5.1","5.6.6","5.6.7","5.6.8","5.6.9","5.6.9.1","5.7.0","5.7.0-beta.1","5.7.0-beta.2","5.7.1","5.7.1.1","5.7.10","5.7.11","5.7.2","5.7.3","5.7.4","5.7.5","5.7.6","5.7.7","5.7.8","5.7.8.1","5.7.8.2","5.7.9","5.8.0","5.8.1","5.8.2","5.8.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54417.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54417.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/a19d46be78a9ca1ea474012a10e97bed0d787f57"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-2vcf-qxv3-2mgw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54417"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-94"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54417.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
