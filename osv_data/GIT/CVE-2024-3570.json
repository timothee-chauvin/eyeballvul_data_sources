{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-3570","published":"2024-04-10T17:15:58Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:35:35Z","details":"A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the chat functionality of the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's session. By manipulating the ChatBot responses, an attacker can inject malicious scripts to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as creating a new admin account or changing the user's password, leading to a complete takeover of the AnythingLLM application. The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of user and ChatBot input, specifically through the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Successful exploitation requires convincing an admin to add a malicious LocalAI ChatBot to their AnythingLLM instance.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a4ace56a401ffc8ce0082d7444159dfd5dc28834"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-3570.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/f0eaf552-aaf3-42b6-a5df-cfecd2de15ee"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/a4ace56a401ffc8ce0082d7444159dfd5dc28834"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
