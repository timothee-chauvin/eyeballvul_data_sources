{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-37297","published":"2024-06-12T15:05:46Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:43:13.742141Z","aliases":["GHSA-cv23-q6gh-xfrf"],"summary":"WooCommerce has a Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in checkout & registration forms","details":"WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce platform built on WordPress. A vulnerability introduced in WooCommerce 8.8 allows for cross-site scripting. A bad actor can manipulate a link to include malicious HTML & JavaScript content. While the content is not saved to the database, the links may be sent to victims for malicious purposes. The injected JavaScript could hijack content & data stored in the browser, including the session. The URL content is read through the `Sourcebuster.js` library and then inserted without proper sanitization to the classic checkout and registration forms. Versions 8.8.5 and 8.9.3 contain a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may disable the Order Attribution feature.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce","events":[{"introduced":"e20ee59681cba67b4d2b4d518b046ea80f3d746b"},{"fixed":"915e32a42762916b745a7e663c8b69a698da8b67"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce","events":[{"introduced":"78078bc482c4d7e7a5ecea5e4482f3a693c0b6e8"},{"fixed":"0e9888305d0cb9557e58f558526ab11cb3bcc4b4"}]}],"versions":["8.9.0","8.9.1","8.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-37297.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2024/06/10/developer-advisory-xss-vulnerability-8-8-0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/security/advisories/GHSA-cv23-q6gh-xfrf"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/commit/0e9888305d0cb9557e58f558526ab11cb3bcc4b4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/commit/915e32a42762916b745a7e663c8b69a698da8b67"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79","CWE-80"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
