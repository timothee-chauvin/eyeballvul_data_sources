An out-of-bounds read may occur when parsing certain configuration values, allowing an attacker to infer or read memory beyond string boundaries in the .rodata section. This could potentially lead to information disclosure or denial of service.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/obgm/libcoap","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e3fdcdcfbd1588754fe9dd4b754ac9397260f0f9"}]}],"versions":["bsd-licensed","coap-lwip","coap-tinydtls","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.2.0","v4.2.0-rc1","v4.2.0-rc2","v4.2.0-rc3","v4.2.0-rc4","v4.2.1","v4.3.0","v4.3.0-rc1","v4.3.0-rc2","v4.3.0-rc3","v4.3.0-rc4","v4.3.1","v4.3.1-rc1","v4.3.1-rc2","v4.3.2","v4.3.2-rc1","v4.3.2-rc2","v4.3.3","v4.3.4","v4.3.5","v4.3.5-rc1","v4.3.5-rc2","v4.3.5-rc3","v4_1_1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59391.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/obgm/libcoap/releases/tag/v4.3.5a"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/obgm/libcoap/pull/1730"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L"}]}
