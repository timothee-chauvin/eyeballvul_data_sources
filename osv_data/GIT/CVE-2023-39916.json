The location of these stored responses is constructed from the URL of the request. Due to insufficient sanitation of the URL, it is possible for an attacker to craft a URL that results in the response being stored outside of the directory specified for it.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nlnetlabs/routinator","events":[{"introduced":"67c1df060db58cf01f112ec4a5c27414025129f0"},{"fixed":"4b41c41f4bbc460669a00a8aad44c4a753665c66"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-39916.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/routinator/CVE-2023-39916.txt"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
