{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2019-12463","published":"2019-09-09T14:15:11.837Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:34:10.921357Z","aliases":["GHSA-w5r2-gvgf-mpm8"],"details":"An issue was discovered in LibreNMS 1.50.1. The scripts that handle graphing options (includes/html/graphs/common.inc.php and includes/html/graphs/graphs.inc.php) do not sufficiently validate or encode several fields of user supplied input. Some parameters are filtered with mysqli_real_escape_string, which is only useful for preventing SQL injection attacks; other parameters are unfiltered. This allows an attacker to inject RRDtool syntax with newline characters via the html/graph.php and html/graph-realtime.php scripts. RRDtool syntax is quite versatile and an attacker could leverage this to perform a number of attacks, including disclosing directory structure and filenames, disclosing file content, denial of service, or writing arbitrary files. NOTE: relative to CVE-2019-10665, this requires authentication and the pathnames differ.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms","events":[{"introduced":"f37e28a5f2f7a1bc90de534ff951afc89531c24d"},{"fixed":"87a2231469ffff35dbd035f63bc24d5956c3e9b2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-12463.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.darkmatter.ae/xen1thlabs/librenms-rrdtool-injection-vulnerability-xl-19-022/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
