Prior to version 1.2.27, there is a file inclusion issue in the `lib/plugin.php` file. Combined with SQL injection vulnerabilities, remote code execution can be implemented. There is a file inclusion issue with the `api_plugin_hook()` function in the `lib/plugin.php` file, which reads the plugin_hooks and plugin_config tables in database. The read data is directly used to concatenate the file path which is used for file inclusion. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cacti/cacti","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b577c294214b7e65a7273031ef8f0045d2a0c5af"}]}],"versions":["releaes/1.2.19","release/1.0.0","release/1.0.1","release/1.0.2","release/1.0.3","release/1.0.4","release/1.0.5","release/1.0.6","release/1.1.0","release/1.1.1","release/1.1.11","release/1.1.12","release/1.1.13","release/1.1.14","release/1.1.15","release/1.1.16","release/1.1.17","release/1.1.18","release/1.1.19","release/1.1.2","release/1.1.20","release/1.1.21","release/1.1.22","release/1.1.23","release/1.1.24","release/1.1.25","release/1.1.26","release/1.1.27","release/1.1.28","release/1.1.29","release/1.1.3","release/1.1.30","release/1.1.31","release/1.1.32","release/1.1.33","release/1.1.34","release/1.1.35","release/1.1.36","release/1.1.37","release/1.1.38","release/1.1.4","release/1.1.5","release/1.1.6","release/1.1.7","release/1.1.8","release/1.2.0","release/1.2.0-beta1","release/1.2.0-beta2","release/1.2.0-beta3","release/1.2.0-beta4","release/1.2.1","release/1.2.10","release/1.2.11","release/1.2.12","release/1.2.13","release/1.2.14","release/1.2.15","release/1.2.16","release/1.2.17","release/1.2.18","release/1.2.19","release/1.2.2","release/1.2.20","release/1.2.21","release/1.2.22","release/1.2.23","release/1.2.24","release/1.2.25","release/1.2.26","release/1.2.3","release/1.2.4","release/1.2.5","release/1.2.6","release/1.2.7","release/1.2.8","release/1.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-31459.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-cx8g-hvq8-p2rv"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-gj3f-p326-gh8r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-pfh9-gwm6-86vp"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/09/msg00027.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RBEOAFKRARQHTDIYSL723XAFJ2Q6624X/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-98"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
