{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-6921","published":"2025-09-23T14:15:41.387Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:33:35.262661Z","aliases":["GHSA-4w7r-h757-3r74"],"details":"The huggingface/transformers library, versions prior to 4.53.0, is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the AdamWeightDecay optimizer. The vulnerability arises from the _do_use_weight_decay method, which processes user-controlled regular expressions in the include_in_weight_decay and exclude_from_weight_decay lists. Malicious regular expressions can cause catastrophic backtracking during the re.search call, leading to 100% CPU utilization and a denial of service. This issue can be exploited by attackers who can control the patterns in these lists, potentially causing the machine learning task to hang and rendering services unresponsive.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"47c34fba5c303576560cb29767efb452ff12b8be"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-6921.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/287d15a7-6e7c-45d2-8c05-11e305776f1f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/commit/47c34fba5c303576560cb29767efb452ff12b8be"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
