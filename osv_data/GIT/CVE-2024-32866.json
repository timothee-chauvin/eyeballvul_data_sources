{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-32866","published":"2024-04-23T21:07:06Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:20:57.816915Z","aliases":["GHSA-624g-8qjg-8qxf"],"summary":"Conform contains Prototype Pollution Vulnerability in `parseWith...` function","details":"Conform, a type-safe form validation library, allows the parsing of nested objects in the form of `object.property`. Due to an improper implementation of this feature in versions prior to 1.1.1, an attacker can exploit the feature to trigger prototype pollution by passing a crafted input to `parseWith...` functions. Applications that use conform for server-side validation of form data or URL parameters are affected by this vulnerability. Version 1.1.1 contains a patch for the issue.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/edmundhung/conform","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7be7bc8c8362d570f124929770784a8210cf9fd6"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.0-pre.0","v0.3.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.0-pre.0","v0.4.0-pre.1","v0.4.0-pre.2","v0.4.0-pre.3","v0.4.1","v0.5.0","v0.5.0-pre.0","v0.5.1","v0.6.0","v0.6.0-pre.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.3-pre.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.0-pre.0","v0.7.0-pre.1","v0.7.0-pre.2","v0.7.0-pre.3","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.8.0","v0.8.0-pre.0","v0.8.0-pre.1","v0.8.0-pre.2","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-pre.0","v1.0.0-pre.1","v1.0.0-pre.2","v1.0.0-pre.3","v1.0.0-pre.4","v1.0.0-pre.5","v1.0.0-pre.6","v1.0.0-pre.7","v1.0.0-rc.0","v1.0.0-rc.1","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-pre.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-32866.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/blob/59156d7115a7207fa3b6f8a70a4342a9b24c2501/packages/conform-dom/formdata.ts#L117"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/commit/4819d51b5a53fd5486fc85c17cdc148eb160e3de"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/security/advisories/GHSA-624g-8qjg-8qxf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1321"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H"}]}
