{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-35153","published":"2023-06-23T17:19:59.290Z","modified":"2025-12-10T10:09:50.959456Z","aliases":["GHSA-4wc6-hqv9-qc97"],"summary":"XWiki Platform vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting in ClassEditSheet page via name parameters","details":"XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 5.4.4 and prior to versions 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0, a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability can be exploited by users with edit rights by adding a `AppWithinMinutes.FormFieldCategoryClass` class on a page and setting the payload on the page title. Then, any user visiting `/xwiki/bin/view/AppWithinMinutes/ClassEditSheet` executes the payload. The issue has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0. As a workaround, update `AppWithinMinutes.ClassEditSheet` with a patch.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons","events":[{"introduced":"a1d7264bf87daf0a38602647504fe0590bd11ed5"},{"fixed":"48ee3193230753aecf8a86d7c8ff3e8f869e8330"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-35153.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1b87fec1e5b5ec00b7a8c3c3f94f6c5e22547392"}]}],"versions":["xwiki-application-calendar-1.0","xwiki-platform-7.3-milestone-2","xwiki-platform-7.4-milestone-1","xwiki-platform-7.4-milestone-2","xwiki-platform-8.0-milestone-1","xwiki-platform-8.0-milestone-2","xwiki-platform-8.1-milestone-1","xwiki-platform-8.1-milestone-2","xwiki-platform-8.2-milestone-1","xwiki-platform-8.2-milestone-2","xwiki-platform-8.3-milestone-1","xwiki-platform-9.9-rc-2","xwiki-plugin-tag-1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-35153.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/35xxx/CVE-2023-35153.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/1b87fec1e5b5ec00b7a8c3c3f94f6c5e22547392#diff-79e725ec7125cced7d302e1a1f955a76745af26ef28a148981b810e85335d302"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-4wc6-hqv9-qc97"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20365"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35153"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79","CWE-80"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/35xxx/CVE-2023-35153.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
