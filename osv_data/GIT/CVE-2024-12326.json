{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-12326","published":"2024-12-06T20:50:51.062Z","modified":"2025-11-20T02:00:06.105151Z","summary":"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') in Jirafeau","details":"Jirafeau normally prevents browser preview for SVG files due to the possibility that manipulated SVG files could be exploited for cross site scripting. This was done by storing the MIME type of a file and preventing the browser preview for MIME type image/svg+xml. This issue was first reported in CVE-2022-30110. However, it was still possible to do a browser preview of a SVG file by sending a manipulated MIME type during the upload, where the case of any letter in image/svg+xml had been changed (like image/svg+XML). The check for image/svg+xml has been changed to be case insensitive.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.com/jirafeau/jirafeau","events":[{"introduced":"25e0f0eae6e04346f02f3212ae95087b917a640c"},{"fixed":"233f1f25a00926f0a74650856fd431357690ed2b"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"4.5.0"},{"fixed":"4.6.1"}]}}],"versions":["4.5.0","4.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-12326.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://gitlab.com/jirafeau/Jirafeau/-/commit/6cfca8753d54e2025c6020b2af32529e25f58c66"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30110"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
