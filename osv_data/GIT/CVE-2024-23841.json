{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-23841","published":"2024-01-30T17:14:12Z","modified":"2025-11-16T03:59:52.306379Z","aliases":["GHSA-rv8p-rr2h-fgpg"],"summary":"XSS in @apollo/experimental-nextjs-app-support","details":"apollo-client-nextjs is the Apollo Client support for the Next.js App Router. The @apollo/experimental-apollo-client-nextjs NPM package is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to either inject malicious input (e.g. by redirecting a user to a specifically-crafted link) or arrange to have malicious input be returned by a GraphQL server (e.g. by persisting it in a database). To fix this issue, please update to version 0.7.0 or later.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-integrations","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b92bc42abd5f8e17d4db361c36bd08e4f541a46b"}]}],"versions":["v.0.3.5","v.0.4.0","v.0.4.1","v.0.4.2","v.0.4.3","v.0.5.0","v.0.5.1","v.0.6.0","v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.5.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-23841.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"748fa72ee1c23d5bb1e6534e2f7dba32cb5a31e7"}]}],"versions":["0.5.0-preview.2","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.10","v0.3.11","v0.3.12","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.3.8","v0.3.9","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.10","v0.4.11","v0.4.13","v0.4.14","v0.4.15","v0.4.16","v0.4.19","v0.4.2","v0.4.20","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.4.8","v0.4.9","v0.5.0","v0.5.0-0","v0.5.0-preview.3","v0.5.1","v0.5.10","v0.5.11","v0.5.12","v0.5.13","v0.5.14","v0.5.16","v0.5.17","v0.5.18","v0.5.19","v0.5.2","v0.5.20","v0.5.21","v0.5.22","v0.5.23","v0.5.24","v0.5.25","v0.5.26","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.5.7","v0.5.8","v0.5.9","v0.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-23841.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs/commit/b92bc42abd5f8e17d4db361c36bd08e4f541a46b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs/security/advisories/GHSA-rv8p-rr2h-fgpg"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-80"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
