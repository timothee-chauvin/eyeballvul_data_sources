In the default emulated shell configuration, these command emulations perform real outbound HTTP requests to attacker-supplied destinations. Because no outbound request rate limiting was enforced, unauthenticated remote attackers could repeatedly invoke these commands to generate unbounded HTTP traffic toward arbitrary third-party targets, allowing the Cowrie honeypot to be abused as a denial-of-service amplification node and masking the attacker’s true source address behind the honeypot’s IP.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ba361a32135d72fdc92c6b95f88cff10ce95ee6c"}]}],"versions":["1.4.1","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.6.0","1.9.7","v1.0.0-alpha","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.9.7","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.6.1","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-34469.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie/releases/tag/v2.9.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-83jg-m2pm-4jxj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/cowrie-unrestricted-wget-curl-emulation-enables-ssrf-based-ddos-amplification"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie/issues/2622"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie/pull/2800"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:L/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
