{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-47180","published":"2024-09-26T19:21:04.584Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:28:35.048357Z","aliases":["GHSA-rxvx-x284-4445"],"summary":"Shields.io Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Dynamic JSON/TOML/YAML badges","details":"Shields.io is a service for concise, consistent, and legible badges in SVG and raster format. Shields.io and users self-hosting their own instance of shields using version < `server-2024-09-25` are vulnerable to a remote execution vulnerability via the JSONPath library used by the Dynamic JSON/Toml/Yaml badges. This vulnerability would allow any user with access to make a request to a URL on the instance to the ability to execute code by crafting a malicious JSONPath expression. All users who self-host an instance are vulnerable. This problem was fixed in server-2024-09-25. Those who follow the tagged releases should update to `server-2024-09-25` or later. Those who follow the rolling tag on DockerHub, `docker pull shieldsio/shields:next` to update to the latest version. As a workaround, blocking access to the endpoints `/badge/dynamic/json`, `/badge/dynamic/toml`, and `/badge/dynamic/yaml` (e.g: via a firewall or reverse proxy in front of your instance) would prevent the exploitable endpoints from being accessed.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/badges/shields","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ba3d436d1cdf786636522a766c3ab472fa8b2b66"}]}],"versions":["1.3.0","2.0.0","2.0.0-beta1","2.1.0","2.2.0","2.2.1","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.1.0","3.2.0","3.3.0","3.3.1","4.0.0","server-2021-01-18","server-2021-02-01","server-2021-03-01","server-2021-04-01","server-2021-05-01","server-2021-06-01","server-2021-07-01","server-2021-08-01","server-2021-09-01","server-2021-10-04","server-2021-11-04","server-2021-12-01","server-2022-01-01","server-2022-02-01","server-2022-03-02","server-2022-04-03","server-2022-05-03","server-2022-06-03","server-2022-07-03","server-2022-08-01","server-2022-09-04","server-2022-10-08","server-2022-11-01","server-2022-12-01","server-2023-01-01","server-2023-02-01","server-2023-03-01","server-2023-04-02","server-2023-05-01","server-2023-06-01","server-2023-07-02","server-2023-08-01","server-2023-09-04","server-2023-10-02","server-2023-11-01","server-2023-12-04","server-2024-01-01","server-2024-02-01","server-2024-03-01","server-2024-04-01","server-2024-05-01","server-2024-06-01","server-2024-07-01","server-2024-08-01","server-2024-09-02"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47180.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/badges/shields/commit/ec1b6c8daccda075403c1688ac02603f7aaa50b2"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/10553"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/badges/shields/pull/10551"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/badges/shields/security/advisories/GHSA-rxvx-x284-4445"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-74"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
