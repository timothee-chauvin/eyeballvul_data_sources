{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-49142","published":"2025-02-26T01:55:12.823Z","modified":"2025-12-04T13:26:27.483937Z","summary":"net: preserve skb_end_offset() in skb_unclone_keeptruesize()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: preserve skb_end_offset() in skb_unclone_keeptruesize()\n\nsyzbot found another way to trigger the infamous WARN_ON_ONCE(delta < len)\nin skb_try_coalesce() [1]\n\nI was able to root cause the issue to kfence.\n\nWhen kfence is in action, the following assertion is no longer true:\n\nint size = xxxx;\nvoid *ptr1 = kmalloc(size, gfp);\nvoid *ptr2 = kmalloc(size, gfp);\n\nif (ptr1 && ptr2)\n\tASSERT(ksize(ptr1) == ksize(ptr2));\n\nWe attempted to fix these issues in the blamed commits, but forgot\nthat TCP was possibly shifting data after skb_unclone_keeptruesize()\nhas been used, notably from tcp_retrans_try_collapse().\n\nSo we not only need to keep same skb->truesize value,\nwe also need to make sure TCP wont fill new tailroom\nthat pskb_expand_head() was able to get from a\naddr = kmalloc(...) followed by ksize(addr)\n\nSplit skb_unclone_keeptruesize() into two parts:\n\n1) Inline skb_unclone_keeptruesize() for the common case,\n   when skb is not cloned.\n\n2) Out of line __skb_unclone_keeptruesize() for the 'slow path'.\n\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 6490 at net/core/skbuff.c:5295 skb_try_coalesce+0x1235/0x1560 net/core/skbuff.c:5295\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 1 PID: 6490 Comm: syz-executor161 Not tainted
