Some treat the\niterator as struct rv_monitor *, while others treat the iterator as struct\nlist_head *.\n\nThis causes a wrong type cast and crashes the system as reported by Nathan.\n\nConvert everything to use struct list_head * as iterator. This also makes\nenabled_monitors consistent with available_monitors.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"de090d1ccae1e191af4beb92964591c6e4f31f28"},{"fixed":"8948a0338d33c4a7ef1e0c439a3ad1d5fe9355ae"},{"fixed":"103541e6a5854b08a25e4caa61e990af1009a52e"}]}],"versions":["v6.17","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40232.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40232.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/103541e6a5854b08a25e4caa61e990af1009a52e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8948a0338d33c4a7ef1e0c439a3ad1d5fe9355ae"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40232.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40232"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40232.json"}}
