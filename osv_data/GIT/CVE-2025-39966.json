The file has the object as it's private_data and holds\na users refcount, while the object is expected to remain alive as long as\nthe file is.\n\nWhen the allocation of a new object aborts before installing the file it\nwill fput() the file and then go on to immediately kfree() the obj. This\ncauses a UAF once the workqueue completes the fput() and tries to\ndecrement the users refcount.\n\nFix this by putting the core code in charge of the file lifetime, and call\n__fput_sync() during abort to ensure that release() is called before\nkfree. __fput_sync() is a bit too tricky to open code in all the object\nimplementations. Instead the objects tell the core code where the file\npointer is and the core will take care of the life cycle.\n\nIf the object is successfully allocated then the file will hold a users\nrefcount and the iommufd_object cannot be destroyed.\n\nIt is worth noting that close(); ioctl(IOMMU_DESTROY); doesn't have an\nissue because close() is already using a synchronous version of fput().\n\nThe UAF looks like this:\n\n    BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in iommufd_eventq_fops_release+0x45/0xc0 drivers/iommu/iommufd/eventq.c:376\n    Write of size 4 at addr ffff888059c97804 by task syz.0.46/6164\n\n    CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 6164 Comm: syz.0.46 Not tainted syzkaller #0 PREEMPT(full)\n    Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 08/18/2025\n    Call Trace:\n     <TASK>\n     __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:94 [inline]\n     dump_stack_lvl+0x116/0x1f0 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n     print_address_description mm/kasan/report.c:378 [inline]\n     print_report+0xcd/0x630 mm/kasan/report.c:482\n     kasan_report+0xe0/0x110 mm/kasan/report.c:595\n     check_region_inline mm/kasan/generic.c:183 [inline]\n     kasan_check_range+0x100/0x1b0 mm/kasan/generic.c:189\n     instrument_atomic_read_write include/linux/instrumented.h:96 [inline]\n     atomic_fetch_sub_release include/linux/atomic/atomic-instrumented.h:400 [inline]\n     __refcount_dec include/linux/refcount.h:455 [inline]\n     refcount_dec include/linux/refcount.h:476 [inline]\n     iommufd_eventq_fops_release+0x45/0xc0 drivers/iommu/iommufd/eventq.c:376\n     __fput+0x402/0xb70 fs/file_table.c:468\n     task_work_run+0x14d/0x240 kernel/task_work.c:227\n     resume_user_mode_work include/linux/resume_user_mode.h:50 [inline]\n     exit_to_user_mode_loop+0xeb/0x110 kernel/entry/common.c:43\n     exit_to_user_mode_prepare include/linux/irq-entry-common.h:225 [inline]\n     syscall_exit_to_user_mode_work include/linux/entry-common.h:175 [inline]\n     syscall_exit_to_user_mode include/linux/entry-common.h:210 [inline]\n     do_syscall_64+0x41c/0x4c0 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:100\n     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"07838f7fd529c8a6de44b601d4b7057e6c8d36ed"},{"fixed":"17195a7d754a5c6a31888702ca93f6f08f3383ad"},{"fixed":"e4825368285e33d6360c6c6a6a10d2d83da06e55"},{"fixed":"4e034bf045b12852a24d5d33f2451850818ba0c1"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.16.1","v6.16.2","v6.16.3","v6.16.4","v6.16.5","v6.16.6","v6.16.7","v6.16.8","v6.16.9","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39966.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.11.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.50"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39966.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/17195a7d754a5c6a31888702ca93f6f08f3383ad"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4e034bf045b12852a24d5d33f2451850818ba0c1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e4825368285e33d6360c6c6a6a10d2d83da06e55"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/39xxx/CVE-2025-39966.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39966"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/39xxx/CVE-2025-39966.json"}}
