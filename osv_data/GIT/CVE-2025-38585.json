It returns the stale 'ret' value from\n   earlier operations instead of indicating the EFI failure.\n\n2. When efi.get_variable() returns EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, it updates\n   *out_len to the required buffer size but writes no data to the output\n   buffer. However, due to bug #1, gmin_get_var_int() believes the call\n   succeeded.\n\nThe caller gmin_get_var_int() then performs:\n- Allocates val[CFG_VAR_NAME_MAX + 1] (65 bytes) on stack\n- Calls gmin_get_config_var(dev, is_gmin, var, val, &len) with len=64\n- If EFI variable is >64 bytes, efi.get_variable() sets len=required_size\n- Due to bug #1, thinks call succeeded with len=required_size\n- Executes val[len] = 0, writing past end of 65-byte stack buffer\n\nThis creates a stack buffer overflow when EFI variables are larger than\n64 bytes. Since EFI variables can be controlled by firmware or system\nconfiguration, this could potentially be exploited for code execution.\n\nFix the bug by returning proper error codes from gmin_get_config_var()\nbased on EFI status instead of stale 'ret' value.\n\nThe gmin_get_var_int() function is called during device initialization\nfor camera sensor configuration on Intel Bay Trail and Cherry Trail\nplatforms using the atomisp camera stack.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"38d4f74bc14847491d07bd745dc4a2c274f4987d"},{"fixed":"3d672fe065aa00f4d66f42e3c9720f69a3ed43e7"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"38d4f74bc14847491d07bd745dc4a2c274f4987d"},{"fixed":"e6d3453a002e89537e6136f6c774659b297a549b"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"38d4f74bc14847491d07bd745dc4a2c274f4987d"},{"fixed":"1a7a2f59fb2eb0718a0cff1e5822500cefe50ed9"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"38d4f74bc14847491d07bd745dc4a2c274f4987d"},{"fixed":"ee4cf798202d285dcbe85e4467a094c44f5ed8e6"}]}],"versions":["v5.19","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.15.1","v6.15.2","v6.15.3","v6.15.4","v6.15.5","v6.15.6","v6.15.7","v6.15.8","v6.15.9","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38585.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.42"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.15.10"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38585.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1a7a2f59fb2eb0718a0cff1e5822500cefe50ed9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3d672fe065aa00f4d66f42e3c9720f69a3ed43e7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e6d3453a002e89537e6136f6c774659b297a549b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ee4cf798202d285dcbe85e4467a094c44f5ed8e6"}]}
