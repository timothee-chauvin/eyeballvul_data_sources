{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-41942","published":"2024-08-08T14:36:44.498Z","modified":"2025-12-05T05:39:46.692090Z","aliases":["BIT-jupyterhub-2024-41942","GHSA-9x4q-3gxw-849f","PYSEC-2024-200"],"related":["CGA-96rm-6ffx-8wm2"],"summary":"JupyterHub has a privilege escalation vulnerability with the `admin:users` scope","details":"JupyterHub is software that allows one to create a multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks. Prior to versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0, if a user is granted the `admin:users` scope, they may escalate their own privileges by making themselves a full admin user. The impact is relatively small in that `admin:users` is already an extremely privileged scope only granted to trusted users.\nIn effect, `admin:users` is equivalent to `admin=True`, which is not intended. Note that the change here only prevents escalation to the built-in JupyterHub admin role that has unrestricted permissions. It does not prevent users with e.g. `groups` permissions from granting themselves or other users permissions via group membership, which is intentional. Versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0 fix this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a1824a4b3ac6f67a93d57fdf3abe3a4f919ae31f"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.6"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub","events":[{"introduced":"c616ab284d06de6202c61a7bdf29913dec4daa3d"},{"fixed":"cdc2151f7585fefa6ff7fdd0b37ece416fa667b8"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"5.0.0"},{"fixed":"5.1.0"}]}}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.5.0","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.8.0","0.8.0b1","0.8.0b2","0.8.0b3","0.8.0b4","0.8.0b5","0.8.0rc1","0.8.0rc2","0.8.1","0.9.0","0.9.0b1","0.9.0b2","0.9.0b3","0.9.0rc1","0.9.1","0.9.2","1.0.0","1.0.0b1","1.0.0b2","1.1.0","1.1.0b1","1.2.0","1.2.0b1","1.2.1","1.3.0","1.4.0","2.0.0","2.0.0b1","2.0.0b2","2.0.0b3","2.0.0rc1","2.0.0rc2","2.0.0rc3","2.0.0rc4","2.0.0rc5","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","3.0.0","3.0.0b1","3.1.0","4.0.0","4.0.0b1","4.0.0b2","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.1.0","4.1.1","4.1.2","4.1.3","4.1.4","4.1.5","5.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-41942.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/41xxx/CVE-2024-41942.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/commit/99e2720b0fc626cbeeca3c6337f917fdacfaa428"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/commit/ff2db557a85b6980f90c3158634bf924063ab8ba"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/security/advisories/GHSA-9x4q-3gxw-849f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41942"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-274"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/41xxx/CVE-2024-41942.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
