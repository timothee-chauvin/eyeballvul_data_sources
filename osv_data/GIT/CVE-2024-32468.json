{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-32468","published":"2024-11-25T18:44:27Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:42:19.843065Z","aliases":["GHSA-qqwr-j9mm-fhw6"],"summary":"Improper neutralization of input during web page generation (\"Cross-site Scripting\") in deno_doc HTML generator","details":"Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript written in rust. Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities existed in the `deno_doc` crate which lead to Self-XSS with deno doc --html. 1.) XSS in generated `search_index.js`, `deno_doc` outputs a JavaScript file for searching. However, the generated file used `innerHTML` on unsanitzed HTML input. 2.) XSS via property, method and enum names, `deno_doc` did not sanitize property names, method names and enum names. The first XSS most likely didn't have an impact since `deno doc --html` is expected to be used locally with own packages.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/denoland/deno","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"9c6eca1064de029e560377bef831e69d22c5c00b"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/denoland/deno_doc","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"47bea7950a684edc37388e7501d49a1c893299fd"}]}],"versions":["deno/0.100.0","deno/0.101.0","deno/0.102.0","deno/0.103.0","deno/0.104.0","deno/0.105.0","deno/0.106.0","deno/0.107.0","deno/0.108.0","deno/0.109.0","deno/0.110.0","deno/0.110.1","deno/0.111.0","deno/0.112.0","deno/0.112.1","deno/0.113.0","deno/0.113.1","deno/0.114.0","deno/0.115.0","deno/0.116.0","deno/0.117.0","deno/0.118.0","deno/0.119.0","deno/0.60.0","deno/0.61.0","deno/0.61.1","deno/0.62.0","deno/0.64.0","deno/0.65.0","deno/0.66.0","deno/0.67.0","deno/0.68.0","deno/0.69.0","deno/0.69.1","deno/0.69.2","deno/0.70.0","deno/0.71.0","deno/0.72.0","deno/0.72.1","deno/0.72.2","deno/0.73.0","deno/0.73.1","deno/0.73.2","deno/0.73.3","deno/0.73.4","deno/0.73.5","deno/0.73.6","deno/0.74.0","deno/0.74.1","deno/0.75.0","deno/0.75.1","deno/0.76.0","deno/0.77.0","deno/0.78.0","deno/0.79.0","deno/0.80.0","deno/0.81.0","deno/0.82.0","deno/0.83.0","deno/0.84.0","deno/0.85.0","deno/0.86.0","deno/0.87.0","deno/0.88.0","deno/0.89.0","deno/0.89.1","deno/0.90.0","deno/0.91.0","deno/0.92.0","deno/0.93.0","deno/0.94.0","deno/0.94.1","deno/0.95.0","deno/0.96.0","deno/0.97.0","deno/0.98.0","deno/0.99.0","std/0.34.0","std/0.35.0","std/0.36.0","std/0.37.0","std/0.38.0","std/0.39.0","std/0.40.0","std/0.41.0","std/0.42.0","std/0.50.0","std/0.51.0","std/0.52.0","std/0.53.0","std/0.54.0","std/0.55.0","std/0.56.0","std/0.57.0","std/0.58.0","std/0.59.0","std/0.60.0","std/0.61.0","std/0.62.0","std/0.63.0","std/0.64.0","std/0.65.0","std/0.66.0","std/0.67.0","std/0.68.0","std/0.69.0","std/0.70.0","std/0.71.0","std/0.72.0","std/0.73.0","std/0.74.0","std/0.75.0","std/0.76.0","std/0.77.0","std/0.78.0","std/0.79.0","std/0.80.0","std/0.81.0","std/0.82.0","std/0.83.0","std/0.84.0","std/0.85.0","v0.0.1","v0.0.3","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.10","v0.1.11","v0.1.12","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.1.9","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.15.0","v0.16.0","v0.17.0","v0.18.0","v0.19.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.10","v0.2.11","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.8","v0.2.9","v0.20.0","v0.21.0","v0.22.0","v0.23.0","v0.24.0","v0.25.0","v0.26.0","v0.27.0","v0.28.0","v0.28.1","v0.29.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.10","v0.3.11","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.3.8","v0.3.9","v0.30.0","v0.30.1","v0.31.0","v0.32.0","v0.33.0","v0.34.0","v0.35.0","v0.36.0","v0.37.0","v0.37.1","v0.38.0","v0.39.0","v0.4.0","v0.40.0","v0.41.0","v0.42.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.0.0-rc3","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.3","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.14.2","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.15.2","v1.15.3","v1.16.0","v1.16.1","v1.16.2","v1.17.0","v1.18.0","v1.19.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.20.0","v1.20.1","v1.21.0","v1.22.0","v1.23.0","v1.24.0","v1.25.0","v1.26.0","v1.27.0","v1.28.0","v1.29.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.30.0","v1.31.0","v1.32.0","v1.33.0","v1.34.0","v1.35.0","v1.36.0","v1.37.0","v1.38.0","v1.39.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.40.0","v1.41.0","v1.42.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-32468.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-qqwr-j9mm-fhw6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno_doc/blob/dc556c848831d7ae48f3eff2ababc6e75eb6b73e/src/html/templates/pages/search.js#L120-L144"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
