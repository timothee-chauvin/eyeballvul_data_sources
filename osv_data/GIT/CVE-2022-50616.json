And this causes\ninit data resource allocated to its parent, not itself. The issue happen\nwhen parent device is going to release and regulator core is still doing\nsome operation of init data constraint for the regulator of child device.\n\nTo fix it, this patch expand 'regulator_register' API to use the\ndifferent devices for init data allocation and DT lookup.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2"},{"fixed":"cb29811d989bcb7ea81ca111c4b13878b344e086"},{"fixed":"b0f25ca1ff9be7abd1679ae7e59a8f25dbffe67a"},{"fixed":"8f3cbcd6b440032ebc7f7d48a1689dcc70a4eb98"}]}],"versions":["v2.6.12","v2.6.12-rc2","v2.6.12-rc3","v2.6.12-rc4","v2.6.12-rc5","v2.6.12-rc6","v2.6.13","v2.6.13-rc1","v2.6.13-rc2","v2.6.13-rc3","v2.6.13-rc4","v2.6.13-rc5","v2.6.13-rc6","v2.6.13-rc7","v2.6.14","v2.6.14-rc1","v2.6.14-rc2","v2.6.14-rc3","v2.6.14-rc4","v2.6.14-rc5","v2.6.15","v2.6.15-rc1","v2.6.15-rc2","v2.6.15-rc3","v2.6.15-rc4","v2.6.15-rc5","v2.6.15-rc6","v2.6.15-rc7","v2.6.16","v2.6.16-rc1","v2.6.16-rc2","v2.6.16-rc3","v2.6.16-rc4","v2.6.16-rc5","v2.6.16-rc6","v2.6.17","v2.6.17-rc1","v2.6.17-rc2","v2.6.17-rc3","v2.6.17-rc4","v2.6.17-rc5","v2.6.17-rc6","v2.6.18","v2.6.18-rc1","v2.6.18-rc2","v2.6.18-rc3","v2.6.18-rc4","v2.6.18-rc5","v2.6.18-rc6","v2.6.18-rc7","v2.6.19","v2.6.19-rc1","v2.6.19-rc2","v2.6.19-rc3","v2.6.19-rc4","v2.6.19-rc5","v2.6.19-rc6","v2.6.20","v2.6.20-rc1","v2.6.20-rc2","v2.6.20-rc3","v2.6.20-rc4","v2.6.20-rc5","v2.6.20-rc6","v2.6.20-rc7","v2.6.21","v2.6.21-rc1","v2.6.21-rc2","v2.6.21-rc3","v2.6.21-rc4","v2.6.21-rc5","v2.6.21-rc6","v2.6.21-rc7","v2.6.22","v2.6.22-rc1","v2.6.22-rc2","v2.6.22-rc3","v2.6.22-rc4","v2.6.22-rc5","v2.6.22-rc6","v2.6.22-rc7","v2.6.23","v2.6.23-rc1","v2.6.23-rc2","v2.6.23-rc3","v2.6.23-rc4","v2.6.23-rc5","v2.6.23-rc6","v2.6.23-rc7","v2.6.23-rc8","v2.6.23-rc9","v2.6.24","v2.6.24-rc1","v2.6.24-rc2","v2.6.24-rc3","v2.6.24-rc4","v2.6.24-rc5","v2.6.24-rc6","v2.6.24-rc7","v2.6.24-rc8","v2.6.25","v2.6.25-rc1","v2.6.25-rc2","v2.6.25-rc3","v2.6.25-rc4","v2.6.25-rc5","v2.6.25-rc6","v2.6.25-rc7","v2.6.25-rc8","v2.6.25-rc9","v2.6.26","v2.6.26-rc1","v2.6.26-rc2","v2.6.26-rc3","v2.6.26-rc4","v2.6.26-rc5","v2.6.26-rc6","v2.6.26-rc7","v2.6.26-rc8","v2.6.26-rc9","v2.6.27","v2.6.27-rc1","v2.6.27-rc2","v2.6.27-rc3","v2.6.27-rc4","v2.6.27-rc5","v2.6.27-rc6","v2.6.27-rc7","v2.6.27-rc8","v2.6.27-rc9","v2.6.28","v2.6.28-rc1","v2.6.28-rc2","v2.6.28-rc3","v2.6.28-rc4","v2.6.28-rc5","v2.6.28-rc6","v2.6.28-rc7","v2.6.28-rc8","v2.6.28-rc9","v2.6.29","v2.6.29-rc1","v2.6.29-rc2","v2.6.29-rc3","v2.6.29-rc4","v2.6.29-rc5","v2.6.29-rc6","v2.6.29-rc7","v2.6.29-rc8","v2.6.30","v2.6.30-rc1","v2.6.30-rc2","v2.6.30-rc3","v2.6.30-rc4","v2.6.30-rc5","v2.6.30-rc6","v2.6.30-rc7","v2.6.30-rc8","v2.6.31","v2.6.31-rc1","v2.6.31-rc2","v2.6.31-rc3","v2.6.31-rc4","v2.6.31-rc5","v2.6.31-rc6","v2.6.31-rc7","v2.6.31-rc8","v2.6.31-rc9","v2.6.32","v2.6.32-rc1","v2.6.32-rc2","v2.6.32-rc3","v2.6.32-rc4","v2.6.32-rc5","v2.6.32-rc6","v2.6.32-rc7","v2.6.32-rc8","v2.6.33","v2.6.33-rc1","v2.6.33-rc2","v2.6.33-rc3","v2.6.33-rc4","v2.6.33-rc5","v2.6.33-rc6","v2.6.33-rc7","v2.6.33-rc8","v2.6.34","v2.6.34-rc1","v2.6.34-rc2","v2.6.34-rc3","v2.6.34-rc4","v2.6.34-rc5","v2.6.34-rc6","v2.6.34-rc7","v2.6.35","v2.6.35-rc1","v2.6.35-rc2","v2.6.35-rc3","v2.6.35-rc4","v2.6.35-rc5","v2.6.35-rc6","v2.6.36","v2.6.36-rc1","v2.6.36-rc2","v2.6.36-rc3","v2.6.36-rc4","v2.6.36-rc5","v2.6.36-rc6","v2.6.36-rc7","v2.6.36-rc8","v2.6.37","v2.6.37-rc1","v2.6.37-rc2","v2.6.37-rc3","v2.6.37-rc4","v2.6.37-rc5","v2.6.37-rc6","v2.6.37-rc7","v2.6.37-rc8","v2.6.38","v2.6.38-rc1","v2.6.38-rc2","v2.6.38-rc3","v2.6.38-rc4","v2.6.38-rc5","v2.6.38-rc6","v2.6.38-rc7","v2.6.38-rc8","v2.6.39","v2.6.39-rc1","v2.6.39-rc2","v2.6.39-rc3","v2.6.39-rc4","v2.6.39-rc5","v2.6.39-rc6","v2.6.39-rc7","v3.0","v3.0-rc1","v3.0-rc2","v3.0-rc3","v3.0-rc4","v3.0-rc5","v3.0-rc6","v3.0-rc7","v3.1","v3.1-rc1","v3.1-rc10","v3.1-rc2","v3.1-rc3","v3.1-rc4","v3.1-rc5","v3.1-rc6","v3.1-rc7","v3.1-rc8","v3.1-rc9","v3.10","v3.10-rc1","v3.10-rc2","v3.10-rc3","v3.10-rc4","v3.10-rc5","v3.10-rc6","v3.10-rc7","v3.11","v3.11-rc1","v3.11-rc2","v3.11-rc3","v3.11-rc4","v3.11-rc5","v3.11-rc6","v3.11-rc7","v3.12","v3.12-rc1","v3.12-rc2","v3.12-rc3","v3.12-rc4","v3.12-rc5","v3.12-rc6","v3.12-rc7","v3.13","v3.13-rc1","v3.13-rc2","v3.13-rc3","v3.13-rc4","v3.13-rc5","v3.13-rc6","v3.13-rc7","v3.13-rc8","v3.14","v3.14-rc1","v3.14-rc2","v3.14-rc3","v3.14-rc4","v3.14-rc5","v3.14-rc6","v3.14-rc7","v3.14-rc8","v3.15","v3.15-rc1","v3.15-rc2","v3.15-rc3","v3.15-rc4","v3.15-rc5","v3.15-rc6","v3.15-rc7","v3.15-rc8","v3.16","v3.16-rc1","v3.16-rc2","v3.16-rc3","v3.16-rc4","v3.16-rc5","v3.16-rc6","v3.16-rc7","v3.17","v3.17-rc1","v3.17-rc2","v3.17-rc3","v3.17-rc4","v3.17-rc5","v3.17-rc6","v3.17-rc7","v3.18","v3.18-rc1","v3.18-rc2","v3.18-rc3","v3.18-rc4","v3.18-rc5","v3.18-rc6","v3.18-rc7","v3.19","v3.19-rc1","v3.19-rc2","v3.19-rc3","v3.19-rc4","v3.19-rc5","v3.19-rc6","v3.19-rc7","v3.2","v3.2-rc1","v3.2-rc2","v3.2-rc3","v3.2-rc4","v3.2-rc5","v3.2-rc6","v3.2-rc7","v3.3","v3.3-rc1","v3.3-rc2","v3.3-rc3","v3.3-rc4","v3.3-rc5","v3.3-rc6","v3.3-rc7","v3.4","v3.4-rc1","v3.4-rc2","v3.4-rc3","v3.4-rc4","v3.4-rc5","v3.4-rc6","v3.4-rc7","v3.5","v3.5-rc1","v3.5-rc2","v3.5-r
