A parsing vulnerability in lnd's onion processing logic and lead to a DoS vector due to excessive memory allocation.  The issue was patched in lnd v0.17.0. Users should update to a version > v0.17.0 to be protected. Users unable to upgrade may set the `--rejecthtlc` CLI flag and also disable forwarding on channels via the `UpdateChanPolicyCommand`, or disable listening on a public network interface via the `--nolisten` flag as a mitigation.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2fb150c8fe827df9df0520ef9916b3afb7b03a8d"}]}],"versions":["0.4-beta","cert/v1.0.0","cert/v1.0.1","cert/v1.0.2","cert/v1.0.3","cert/v1.1.0","cert/v1.1.1","cert/v1.2.0","cert/v1.2.1","cert/v1.2.2","clock/v1.0.0","clock/v1.0.1","clock/v1.1.0","clock/v1.1.1","healthcheck/v1.0.0","healthcheck/v1.0.1","healthcheck/v1.0.2","healthcheck/v1.1.0","healthcheck/v1.2.0","healthcheck/v1.2.1","healthcheck/v1.2.2","healthcheck/v1.2.3","kvdb/v1.0.0","kvdb/v1.0.1","kvdb/v1.0.2","kvdb/v1.0.3","kvdb/v1.1.0","kvdb/v1.2.0","kvdb/v1.2.1","kvdb/v1.2.3","kvdb/v1.2.4","kvdb/v1.2.5","kvdb/v1.3.0","kvdb/v1.3.1","kvdb/v1.4.0","kvdb/v1.4.1","kvdb/v1.4.2","kvdb/v1.4.3","kvdb/v1.4.4","queue/v1.0.1","queue/v1.0.2","queue/v1.0.3","queue/v1.0.4","queue/v1.1.0","queue/v1.1.1","ticker/v1.1.0","ticker/v1.1.1","tlv/v1.0.1","tlv/v1.0.2","tlv/v1.0.3","tlv/v1.1.0","tlv/v1.1.1","tor/v1.0.0","tor/v1.0.1","tor/v1.0.2","tor/v1.1.0","tor/v1.1.1","tor/v1.1.2","upstream","v0.1-alpha","v0.1.1-alpha","v0.10.0-beta","v0.10.0-beta.rc1","v0.10.0-beta.rc2","v0.10.0-beta.rc3","v0.10.0-beta.rc4","v0.10.0-beta.rc5","v0.10.0-beta.rc6","v0.11","v0.11.0-beta","v0.11.0-beta.rc1","v0.11.0-beta.rc2","v0.11.0-beta.rc3","v0.11.0-beta.rc4","v0.12.0-beta","v0.12.0-beta.rc1","v0.12.0-beta.rc2","v0.12.0-beta.rc3","v0.12.0-beta.rc3-testbuild7","v0.12.0-beta.rc4","v0.12.0-beta.rc5","v0.12.0-beta.rc6","v0.13.0-beta","v0.13.0-beta.rc1","v0.13.0-beta.rc2","v0.13.0-beta.rc3","v0.13.0-beta.rc4","v0.13.0-beta.rc5","v0.14.0-beta","v0.14.0-beta.rc1","v0.14.0-beta.rc2","v0.14.0-beta.rc3","v0.14.0-beta.rc4","v0.14.1-beta","v0.15.0-beta","v0.15.0-beta.rc1","v0.15.0-beta.rc2","v0.15.0-beta.rc3","v0.15.0-beta.rc4","v0.15.0-beta.rc5","v0.15.0-beta.rc6","v0.16.0-beta","v0.16.0-beta.rc1","v0.16.0-beta.rc2","v0.16.0-beta.rc3","v0.16.0-beta.rc4","v0.16.0-beta.rc5","v0.17.0-beta.rc1","v0.17.0-beta.rc2","v0.17.0-beta.rc3","v0.17.0-beta.rc4","v0.17.0-beta.rc5","v0.17.0-beta.rc6","v0.2-alpha","v0.2.1-alpha","v0.3-alpha","v0.4-beta","v0.4.1-beta","v0.4.2-beta","v0.5-beta","v0.5-beta-rc1","v0.5-beta-rc2","v0.5.1-beta","v0.5.1-beta-rc1","v0.5.1-beta-rc2","v0.5.1-beta-rc3","v0.5.1-beta-rc4","v0.6-beta","v0.6-beta-rc1","v0.6-beta-rc2","v0.6-beta-rc3","v0.6-beta-rc4","v0.6.0-beta","v0.6.1-beta","v0.6.1-beta-rc1","v0.6.1-beta-rc2","v0.7.0-beta","v0.7.0-beta-rc1","v0.7.0-beta-rc2","v0.7.0-beta-rc3","v0.7.1-beta","v0.7.1-beta-rc1","v0.7.1-beta-rc2","v0.8.0-beta","v0.8.0-beta-rc1","v0.8.0-beta-rc2","v0.8.0-beta-rc3","v0.9.0-beta","v0.9.0-beta-rc1","v0.9.0-beta-rc2","v0.9.0-beta-rc3","v0.9.0-beta-rc4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-38359.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/dos-disclosure-lnd-onion-bomb/979"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/38xxx/CVE-2024-38359.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.17.0-beta"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/security/advisories/GHSA-9gxx-58q6-42p7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lightning.network"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://morehouse.github.io/lightning/lnd-onion-bomb"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38359"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-20"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/38xxx/CVE-2024-38359.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
