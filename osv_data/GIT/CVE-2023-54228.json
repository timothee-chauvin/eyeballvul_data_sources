Similarly, resources allocated\nby clk_register_fixed_rate() are not freed in the error path.\n\nFix these issues by using devm_clk_hw_register_fixed_rate() and\ndevm_clk_hw_register_clkdev().\n\nAfter this, the static variable clk is not needed. Replace it with \nlocal variable hw in probe() and drop calling clk_unregister_fixed_rate()\nfrom raa215300_rtc_unregister_device().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"7bce16630837c705f72e8fd53a11ae8c236236f4"},{"fixed":"2bf2d2ac9e67184dc99275875a6452ca6e3027ff"},{"fixed":"e21ac64e669e960688e79bf5babeed63132dac8a"}]}],"versions":["v6.4","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.5.1","v6.5.2","v6.5.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54228.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.5.0"},{"fixed":"6.5.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54228.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2bf2d2ac9e67184dc99275875a6452ca6e3027ff"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e21ac64e669e960688e79bf5babeed63132dac8a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54228.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54228"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54228.json"}}
