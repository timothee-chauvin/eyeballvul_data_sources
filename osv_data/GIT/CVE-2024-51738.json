In 0.23.1 and earlier, Sunshine's pairing protocol implementation does not validate request order and is thereby vulnerable to a MITM attack, potentially allowing an unauthenticated attacker to pair a client by hijacking a legitimate pairing attempt. This bug may also be used by a remote attacker to crash Sunshine. This vulnerability is fixed in 2025.118.151840.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lizardbyte/sunshine","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"26566cc04db12c5bc7434e480cffa025ed838bce"}]}],"versions":["0.5.0","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.4.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.7","v0.8.0","v0.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-51738.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["100797209542739115812235067227520091293","329401114149137010212533541894201858521","318869231849667477070365927931170859211","217289876954024892228425605780184212001","209396242423772124008953874661009101364","333404222899660741237501109237317311480","102335417461609269863129701546020173774","252350538578695794295935125722942899083"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2024-51738-0ba23997","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/lizardbyte/sunshine/commit/26566cc04db12c5bc7434e480cffa025ed838bce","target":{"file":"tests/unit/test_http_pairing.cpp"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/commit/89f097ae65277d42b5d40163d09d92e412e6d7dd"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/security/advisories/GHSA-3hrw-xv8h-9499"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-305","CWE-476","CWE-841"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
