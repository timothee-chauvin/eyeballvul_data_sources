fix disconnect vs accept race","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: fix disconnect vs accept race\n\nDespite commit 0ad529d9fd2b (\"mptcp: fix possible divide by zero in\nrecvmsg()\"), the mptcp protocol is still prone to a race between\ndisconnect() (or shutdown) and accept.\n\nThe root cause is that the mentioned commit checks the msk-level\nflag, but mptcp_stream_accept() does acquire the msk-level lock,\nas it can rely directly on the first subflow lock.\n\nAs reported by Christoph than can lead to a race where an msk\nsocket is accepted after that mptcp_subflow_queue_clean() releases\nthe listener socket lock and just before it takes destructive\nactions leading to the following splat:\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer
