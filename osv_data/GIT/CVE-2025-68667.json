{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68667","published":"2025-12-23T22:45:25.958Z","modified":"2025-12-24T22:15:36.422730Z","aliases":["GHSA-22fw-4jq7-g8r8"],"summary":"continuwuity Has an Unintended Proxy or Intermediary and Improper Input Validation","details":"continuwuity is a Matrix homeserver written in Rust. Prior to version 0.5.0, this vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to force the target server to cryptographically sign arbitrary membership events. The flaw exists because the server fails to validate the origin of a signing request, provided the event's state_key is a valid user ID belonging to the target server. This issue has been patched in version 0.5.0. A workaround for this issue involves blocking access to the PUT /_matrix/federation/v2/invite/{roomId}/{eventId} endpoint using the reverse proxy.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/continuwuity/continuwuity","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f4ccb819137d13996de23392d5607bb5ade0a246"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.5.0"}]}}],"versions":["v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.5-rc","v0.4.6","v0.4.6-rc","v0.4.7-rc","v0.5.0-rc","v0.5.0-rc.5","v0.5.0-rc.6","v0.5.0-rc.7","v0.5.0-rc.8","v0.5.0-rc2","v0.5.0-rc3","v0.5.0-rc4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68667.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/commit/7fa4fa98628593c1a963f5aa8dbc3657d604b047"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/commit/b2bead67ac8bc45de9a612578f295e5b7fc6c2b5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68667.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/continuwuity/continuwuity/security/advisories/GHSA-22fw-4jq7-g8r8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68667"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-20","CWE-441"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68667.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:L/SA:L"}]}
