In version 2.1.4 and prior, an insecure view count mechanism in the forum page allows an unauthenticated attacker to artificially increase the view count. The application relies on a client-side cookie (nl-topic-[tid]) (or session variable for guests) to determine if a view should be counted. When a client does not provide the cookie, every page request increments the counter, leading to incorrect view metrics. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/namelessmc/nameless","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4726f43c3e637ca6c97a3bc813794311ef523ea6"}]}],"versions":["v2.0.0","v2.0.0-pr1","v2.0.0-pr10","v2.0.0-pr11","v2.0.0-pr12","v2.0.0-pr13","v2.0.0-pr2","v2.0.0-pr3","v2.0.0-pr4","v2.0.0-pr5","v2.0.0-pr6","v2.0.0-pr7","v2.0.0-pr8","v2.0.0-pr9","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-31120.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/commit/9b112c0beab346a38b6f5a51e7773b38c6fc52e7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/releases/tag/v2.2.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/security/advisories/GHSA-8jv7-77jw-h646"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-565"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
