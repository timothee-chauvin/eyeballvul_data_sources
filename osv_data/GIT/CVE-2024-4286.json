{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-4286","published":"2024-05-26T23:15:21.600Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:33:54.345715Z","details":"Mintplex-Labs' anything-llm application is vulnerable to improper neutralization of special elements used in an expression language statement, identified in the commit id `57984fa85c31988b2eff429adfc654c46e0c342a`. The vulnerability arises from the application's handling of user modifications by managers or admins, allowing for the modification of all existing attributes of the `user` database entity without proper checks or sanitization.
