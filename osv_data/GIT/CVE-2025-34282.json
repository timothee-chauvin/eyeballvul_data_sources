An attacker can upload a malicious SVG file that references a remote URL. If the server processes the SVG file in a way that parses external references, it may initiate unintended outbound requests. This can be used to access internal services or resources.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"292e6a36a120c2056a3c19b501d8245d9e6f2db0"}]}],"versions":["v1.0","v1.1","v1.2","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3","v1.3.1","v2.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.1","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.2","v2.3","v2.4","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.2.1","v2.4.3","v2.5","v3.4","v4.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-34282.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/releases/tag/v4.2.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/thingsboard-svg-image-ssrf"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/pull/13927"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
