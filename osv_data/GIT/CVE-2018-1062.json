{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2018-1062","published":"2018-03-06T15:29:00Z","modified":"2025-10-21T04:27:10.637266Z","details":"A vulnerability was discovered in oVirt 4.1.x before 4.1.9, where the combination of Enable Discard and Wipe After Delete flags for VM disks managed by oVirt, could cause a disk to be incompletely zeroed when removed from a VM. If the same storage blocks happen to be later allocated to a new disk attached to another VM, potentially sensitive data could be revealed to privileged users of that VM.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ovirt/ovirt-engine","events":[{"introduced":"037bb3551b8dfacf6c3e9a3f366742804087e186"},{"fixed":"fde819a8d6ba1b5fd93f96cbbd61c93fa2bc2231"}]}],"versions":["ovirt-engine-4.1.0","ovirt-engine-4.1.0.1","ovirt-engine-4.1.0.2","ovirt-engine-4.1.1","ovirt-engine-4.1.1.1","ovirt-engine-4.1.1.2","ovirt-engine-4.1.2","ovirt-engine-4.1.2.1","ovirt-engine-4.1.2.2","ovirt-engine-4.1.3","ovirt-engine-4.1.3.1","ovirt-engine-4.1.3.2","ovirt-engine-4.1.3.3","ovirt-engine-4.1.3.4","ovirt-engine-4.1.3.5","ovirt-engine-4.1.4","ovirt-engine-4.1.4.1","ovirt-engine-4.1.5","ovirt-engine-4.1.5.1","ovirt-engine-4.1.5.2","ovirt-engine-4.1.6","ovirt-engine-4.1.6.1","ovirt-engine-4.1.6.2","ovirt-engine-4.1.7","ovirt-engine-4.1.7.1","ovirt-engine-4.1.7.2","ovirt-engine-4.1.7.3","ovirt-engine-4.1.7.4","ovirt-engine-4.1.7.5","ovirt-engine-4.1.7.6","ovirt-engine-4.1.8","ovirt-engine-4.1.8.1","ovirt-engine-4.1.8.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-1062.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103433"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:0135"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1549944"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/84861/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/84875/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
