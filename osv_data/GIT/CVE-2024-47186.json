Versions of Filament from v3.0.0 through v3.2.114 are affected by a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. If values passed to a `ColorColumn` or `ColumnEntry` are not valid and contain a specific set of characters, applications are vulnerable to XSS attack against a user who opens a page on which a color column or entry is rendered. Filament v3.2.115 fixes this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/filamentphp/filament","events":[{"introduced":"366535ae9026ef38c588ed7e697cda6492593f6f"},{"fixed":"884f25694a86ca9ddd28da8b0e2c12275adc3feb"}]}],"versions":["v2.17.52","v2.17.53","v2.17.54","v2.17.55","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-beta28","v3.0.1","v3.0.10","v3.0.100","v3.0.101","v3.0.102","v3.0.103","v3.0.11","v3.0.12","v3.0.13","v3.0.14","v3.0.15","v3.0.16","v3.0.17","v3.0.18","v3.0.19","v3.0.2","v3.0.20","v3.0.21","v3.0.22","v3.0.23","v3.0.24","v3.0.25","v3.0.26","v3.0.27","v3.0.28","v3.0.29","v3.0.3","v3.0.30","v3.0.31","v3.0.32","v3.0.33","v3.0.34","v3.0.35","v3.0.36","v3.0.37","v3.0.38","v3.0.39","v3.0.4","v3.0.40","v3.0.41","v3.0.42","v3.0.43","v3.0.44","v3.0.45","v3.0.46","v3.0.47","v3.0.48","v3.0.49","v3.0.5","v3.0.50","v3.0.51","v3.0.52","v3.0.53","v3.0.54","v3.0.55","v3.0.56","v3.0.57","v3.0.58","v3.0.59","v3.0.6","v3.0.60","v3.0.61","v3.0.62","v3.0.63","v3.0.64","v3.0.65","v3.0.66","v3.0.67","v3.0.68","v3.0.69","v3.0.7","v3.0.70","v3.0.71","v3.0.72","v3.0.73","v3.0.74","v3.0.75","v3.0.76","v3.0.77","v3.0.78","v3.0.79","v3.0.8","v3.0.80","v3.0.81","v3.0.82","v3.0.83","v3.0.84","v3.0.85","v3.0.86","v3.0.87","v3.0.88","v3.0.89","v3.0.9","v3.0.90","v3.0.91","v3.0.92","v3.0.93","v3.0.94","v3.0.95","v3.0.96","v3.0.97","v3.0.98","v3.0.99","v3.1.0","v3.1.0-alpha1","v3.1.0-alpha2","v3.1.0-alpha3","v3.1.0-alpha4","v3.1.1","v3.1.10","v3.1.11","v3.1.12","v3.1.13","v3.1.14","v3.1.15","v3.1.16","v3.1.17","v3.1.18","v3.1.19","v3.1.2","v3.1.20","v3.1.21","v3.1.22","v3.1.23","v3.1.24","v3.1.25","v3.1.26","v3.1.27","v3.1.28","v3.1.29","v3.1.3","v3.1.30","v3.1.31","v3.1.32","v3.1.33","v3.1.34","v3.1.35","v3.1.36","v3.1.37","v3.1.38","v3.1.39","v3.1.4","v3.1.40","v3.1.41","v3.1.42","v3.1.43","v3.1.44","v3.1.45","v3.1.46","v3.1.47","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.1.9","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.10","v3.2.100","v3.2.101","v3.2.102","v3.2.103","v3.2.104","v3.2.105","v3.2.106","v3.2.107","v3.2.108","v3.2.109","v3.2.11","v3.2.110","v3.2.111","v3.2.112","v3.2.113","v3.2.114","v3.2.12","v3.2.13","v3.2.14","v3.2.15","v3.2.16","v3.2.17","v3.2.18","v3.2.19","v3.2.2","v3.2.20","v3.2.21","v3.2.22","v3.2.23","v3.2.24","v3.2.25","v3.2.25-beta1","v3.2.26","v3.2.27","v3.2.28","v3.2.29","v3.2.3","v3.2.30","v3.2.31","v3.2.32","v3.2.33","v3.2.34","v3.2.35","v3.2.36","v3.2.37","v3.2.38","v3.2.39","v3.2.4","v3.2.40","v3.2.41","v3.2.42","v3.2.43","v3.2.44","v3.2.45","v3.2.46","v3.2.47","v3.2.48","v3.2.49","v3.2.5","v3.2.50","v3.2.51","v3.2.52","v3.2.53","v3.2.54","v3.2.55","v3.2.56","v3.2.57","v3.2.58","v3.2.59","v3.2.6","v3.2.60","v3.2.61","v3.2.62","v3.2.63","v3.2.64","v3.2.65","v3.2.66","v3.2.67","v3.2.68","v3.2.69","v3.2.7","v3.2.70","v3.2.71","v3.2.72","v3.2.73","v3.2.74","v3.2.75","v3.2.76","v3.2.77","v3.2.78","v3.2.79","v3.2.8","v3.2.80","v3.2.81","v3.2.82","v3.2.83","v3.2.84","v3.2.85","v3.2.86","v3.2.87","v3.2.87-beta1","v3.2.88","v3.2.89","v3.2.9","v3.2.90","v3.2.91","v3.2.92","v3.2.93","v3.2.94","v3.2.95","v3.2.96","v3.2.97","v3.2.98","v3.2.99"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47186.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/47xxx/CVE-2024-47186.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/commit/df7989352464d08eda5837ef50f9997fad902316"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/releases/tag/v3.2.115"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/security/advisories/GHSA-9h9q-qhxg-89xr"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47186"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/47xxx/CVE-2024-47186.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
