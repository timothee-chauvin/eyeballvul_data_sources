{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-11849","published":"2025-10-17T05:15:33Z","modified":"2025-10-23T05:15:08.955903Z","aliases":["GHSA-rmjr-87wv-gf87"],"details":"Versions of the package mammoth from 0.3.25 and before 1.11.0; versions of the package mammoth from 0.3.25 and before 1.11.0; versions of the package mammoth before 1.11.0; versions of the package org.zwobble.mammoth:mammoth before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Directory Traversal due to the lack of path or file type validation when processing a docx file containing an image with an external link (r:link attribute instead of embedded r:embed). The library resolves the URI to a file path and after reading, the content is encoded as base64 and included in the HTML output as a data URI. An attacker can read arbitrary files on the system where the conversion is performed or cause an excessive resources consumption by crafting a docx file that links to special device files such as /dev/random or /dev/zero.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mwilliamson/mammoth.js","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c54aaeb43a7941317c1f3c119ffa92090f988820"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.1.2","0.1.3","0.1.4","0.1.5","0.1.6","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.2","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.10","0.3.11","0.3.12","0.3.13","0.3.14","0.3.15","0.3.16","0.3.17","0.3.18","0.3.19","0.3.2","0.3.20","0.3.21","0.3.22","0.3.23","0.3.24","0.3.25","0.3.25-pre.1","0.3.26","0.3.27","0.3.28","0.3.28-pre.1","0.3.29","0.3.3","0.3.30","0.3.31","0.3.32","0.3.33","0.3.4","0.3.5","0.3.6","0.3.7","0.3.8","0.3.9","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.1.0","1.10.0","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.2.5","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.5","1.3.6","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.10","1.4.11","1.4.12","1.4.13","1.4.14","1.4.15","1.4.16","1.4.17","1.4.18","1.4.19","1.4.2","1.4.20","1.4.21","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.4.8","1.4.9","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.6.0","1.7.0","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.8.0","1.9.0","1.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-11849.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mwilliamson/mammoth.js/commit/c54aaeb43a7941317c1f3c119ffa92090f988820"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://gist.github.com/AudunWA/4d690d9ae5efdafe7cf71d9c2ee90a10"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DOTNET-MAMMOTH-13561968"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGZWOBBLEMAMMOTH-13561969"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-MAMMOTH-13554470"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-MAMMOTH-13561967"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:N/SA:H/E:P/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
