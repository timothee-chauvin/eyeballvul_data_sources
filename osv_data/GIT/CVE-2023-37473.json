Passing _callable strings_ (ie `system`) caused the function to be executed. This would result in a limited subset of specific user input being executed as if it were code. This issue has been addressed in commit `f4b1c48820` and included in release version 0.2.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that user input is not passed to either `EntityRepository::find()` or `query()`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zenstruck/collection","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5401c5f33505077f0e129f7aee7735a3a710e072"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-37473.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/37xxx/CVE-2023-37473.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zenstruck/collection/commit/f4b1c488206e1b1581b06fcd331686846f13f19c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/zenstruck/collection/releases/tag/v0.2.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zenstruck/collection/security/advisories/GHSA-7xr2-8ff7-6fjq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37473"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-74"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/37xxx/CVE-2023-37473.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
