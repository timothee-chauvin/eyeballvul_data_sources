Using their membership to the \"docker\" group, an attacker with this role is able to run docker and mount the host OS. Within docker, it is possible to modify the host OS filesystem and modify /etc/groups to gain administrative privileges. All images created after 2020-May-07 (20200507) are fixed, and if you cannot update, we recommend you edit /etc/group/security.conf and remove the \"docker\" user from the OS Login entry.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/guest-oslogin","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"7b956e59ae133351ddee60cfc471bb9f854c71e3"}]}],"versions":["20200113.00","20200116.00","20200325.00","20200504.00","20200507.00"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-8907.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00037.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00047.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins/#gcp-2020-008"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/guest-oslogin/pull/29"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/gl-redteam/red-team-tech-notes/-/tree/master/oslogin-privesc-june-2020"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
