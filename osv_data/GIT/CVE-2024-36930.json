fix null pointer dereference within spi_sync","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: fix null pointer dereference within spi_sync\n\nIf spi_sync() is called with the non-empty queue and the same spi_message\nis then reused, the complete callback for the message remains set while\nthe context is cleared, leading to a null pointer dereference when the\ncallback is invoked from spi_finalize_current_message().\n\nWith function inlining disabled, the call stack might look like this:\n\n  _raw_spin_lock_irqsave from complete_with_flags+0x18/0x58\n
