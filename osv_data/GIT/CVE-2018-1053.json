This can allow an authenticated attacker to read or modify the one file, which may contain encrypted or unencrypted database passwords. The attack is infeasible if a directory mode blocks the attacker searching the current working directory or if the prevailing umask blocks the attacker opening the file.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git","events":[{"introduced":"da645b3a73580ac30cf02e932b42d06157b98229"},{"fixed":"0a0ee721f8190f8e6e633aa959bf9801932bd361"}]}],"versions":["REL9_3_0","REL9_3_1","REL9_3_10","REL9_3_11","REL9_3_12","REL9_3_13","REL9_3_14","REL9_3_15","REL9_3_16","REL9_3_17","REL9_3_18","REL9_3_19","REL9_3_2","REL9_3_20","REL9_3_3","REL9_3_4","REL9_3_5","REL9_3_6","REL9_3_7","REL9_3_8","REL9_3_9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-1053.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102986"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2511"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2566"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3816"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/02/msg00006.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3564-1/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1829/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
