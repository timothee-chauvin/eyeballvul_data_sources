As a result, this was allowing possible denial of\nservice.\n\nWe now only allow the DRM master or users with the CAP_SYS_NICE\ncapability to set higher priorities than PANTHOR_GROUP_PRIORITY_MEDIUM.\n\nAs the sole user of that uAPI lives in Mesa and hardcode a value of\nMEDIUM [1], this should be safe to do.\n\nAdditionally, as those checks are performed at the ioctl level,\npanthor_group_create now only check for priority level validity.\n\n[1]https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/f390835074bdf162a63deb0311d1a6de527f9f89/src/gallium/drivers/panfrost/pan_csf.c#L1038","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"de85488138247d034eb3241840424a54d660926b"},{"fixed":"33eb0344e186a2bcc257c6c5a6e65c1cb42adb4a"},{"fixed":"5f7762042f8a5377bd8a32844db353c0311a7369"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.10.1","v6.10.2","v6.10.3","v6.10.4","v6.10.5","v6.10.6","v6.10.7","v6.10.8","v6.10.9","v6.11-rc1","v6.8","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-46837.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.10.0"},{"fixed":"6.10.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-46837.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/33eb0344e186a2bcc257c6c5a6e65c1cb42adb4a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f7762042f8a5377bd8a32844db353c0311a7369"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/46xxx/CVE-2024-46837.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46837"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/46xxx/CVE-2024-46837.json"}}
