Kubernetes clusters are only affected if an untrusted user can modify Node objects and send proxy requests to them. Kubernetes supports node proxying, which allows clients of kube-apiserver to access endpoints of a Kubelet to establish connections to Pods, retrieve container logs, and more. While Kubernetes already validates the proxying address for Nodes, a bug in kube-apiserver made it possible to bypass this validation. Bypassing this validation could allow authenticated requests destined for Nodes to to the API server's private network.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b28e1f370a4a4c428ddbeababcaf0198f048fcac"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-3294.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubelet","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8101aa62e43b04b5092715d892c7e6b08ee1b9d0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-3294.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/113757"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/VyPOxF7CIbA"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230505-0007/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
