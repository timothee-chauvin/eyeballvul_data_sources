Prior to version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. Starting with version 19.7.0, matrix-js-sdk has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages. Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2d067ad95778b26aed24b801be0951e215c3ac8c"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.10.0","v0.10.0-rc.1","v0.10.0-rc.2","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.10.2-rc.1","v0.10.3","v0.10.3-rc.1","v0.10.4","v0.10.4-rc.1","v0.10.5","v0.10.5-rc.1","v0.10.6","v0.10.6-rc.1","v0.10.7","v0.10.7-rc.1","v0.10.8","v0.10.8-rc.1","v0.10.9","v0.10.9-rc.1","v0.10.9-rc.2","v0.11.0","v0.11.0-rc.1","v0.11.1","v0.11.1-rc.1","v0.12.0","v0.12.0-rc.1","v0.12.1","v0.12.1-rc.1","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.14.0","v0.14.0-rc.1","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.2-rc.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.6.0-rc1","v0.6.0-rc2","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.6.4-rc.1","v0.6.4-rc.2","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.1-rc.1","v0.7.10","v0.7.11","v0.7.11-rc.1","v0.7.12","v0.7.12-rc.1","v0.7.13","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.4-rc.1","v0.7.5","v0.7.5-rc.1","v0.7.5-rc.2","v0.7.5-rc.3","v0.7.6","v0.7.6-rc.1","v0.7.6-rc.2","v0.7.7","v0.7.7-rc.1","v0.7.8","v0.7.8-rc.1","v0.7.9","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.1-rc.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.8.3-rc.1","v0.8.4","v0.8.5","v0.8.5-rc.1","v0.9.0","v0.9.0-rc.1","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc.1","v1.0.0-rc.2","v1.0.1","v1.0.1-rc.1","v1.0.1-rc.2","v1.0.2","v1.0.2-rc.1","v1.0.3","v1.0.3-rc.1","v1.0.4","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc.1","v10.0.0","v10.0.0-rc.1","v10.1.0","v10.1.0-rc.1","v11.0.0","v11.0.0-rc.1","v11.1.0","v11.1.0-rc.1","v11.2.0","v11.2.0-rc.1","v12.0.0","v12.0.0-rc.1","v12.0.1","v12.0.1-rc.1","v12.1.0","v12.1.0-rc.1","v12.2.0","v12.2.0-rc.1","v12.3.0","v12.3.0-rc.1","v12.3.0-rc.2","v12.3.1","v12.4.0","v12.4.0-rc.1","v12.4.1","v12.5.0","v12.5.0-rc.1","v13.0.0","v13.0.0-rc.1","v14.0.0","v14.0.0-rc.1","v14.0.0-rc.2","v14.0.1","v15.0.0","v15.0.0-rc.1","v15.1.0","v15.1.0-rc.1","v15.1.1","v15.1.1-rc.1","v15.2.0","v15.2.0-rc.1","v15.2.1","v15.3.0","v15.3.0-rc.1","v15.4.0","v15.4.0-rc.1","v15.5.0","v15.5.0-rc.1","v15.5.1","v15.5.1-rc.1","v15.5.2","v15.6.0","v15.6.0-rc.1","v16.0.0","v16.0.0-rc.1","v16.0.1","v16.0.1-rc.1","v16.0.2-rc.1","v17.0.0","v17.0.0-rc.1","v17.0.0-rc.2","v17.0.0-rc.3","v17.1.0","v17.1.0-rc.1","v17.2.0","v17.2.0-rc.1","v18.0.0","v18.0.0-rc.1","v18.0.0-rc.2","v18.1.0","v18.1.0-rc.1","v19.0.0","v19.0.0-rc.1","v19.1.0","v19.1.0-rc.1","v19.2.0","v19.2.0-rc.1","v19.3.0","v19.3.0-rc.1","v19.3.0-rc.2","v19.4.0","v19.4.0-rc.1","v19.5.0","v19.5.0-rc.1","v19.5.0-rc.2","v19.5.0-rc.3","v19.5.0-rc.4","v19.6.0","v19.6.0-rc.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.1-rc.1","v2.0.1-rc.2","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-rc.1","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.0-rc.1","v2.2.0-rc.2","v2.3.0","v2.3.0-rc.1","v2.3.1","v2.3.1-rc.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.2-rc.1","v2.4.0","v2.4.0-rc.1","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.2-rc.1","v2.4.3","v2.4.3-rc.1","v2.4.4","v2.4.4-rc.1","v2.4.5","v2.4.6","v2.4.6-rc.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-rc.1","v3.42.2-rc.3","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-rc.1","v5.0.0","v5.0.0-rc.1","v5.0.1","v5.1.0","v5.1.0-rc.1","v5.1.1","v5.1.1-rc.1","v5.2.0","v5.2.0-rc.1","v5.3.0-rc.1","v5.3.1-rc.1","v5.3.1-rc.2","v5.3.1-rc.3","v5.3.1-rc.4","v6.0.0","v6.0.0-rc.1","v6.0.0-rc.2","v6.1.0","v6.1.0-rc.1","v6.2.0","v6.2.0-rc.1","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v7.0.0","v7.0.0-rc.1","v7.1.0","v7.1.0-rc.1","v8.0.0","v8.0.1","v8.0.1-rc.1","v8.1.0","v8.1.0-rc.1","v8.2.0","v8.2.0-rc.1","v8.3.0","v8.3.0-rc.1","v8.4.0","v8.4.0-rc.1","v8.4.1","v8.5.0","v8.5.0-rc.1","v9.0.0","v9.0.0-rc.1","v9.0.1","v9.1.0","v9.1.0-rc.1","v9.10.0","v9.10.0-rc.1","v9.11.0","v9.11.0-rc.1","v9.2.0","v9.2.0-rc.1","v9.3.0","v9.3.0-rc.1","v9.4.0","v9.4.0-rc.1","v9.4.0-rc.2","v9.4.1","v9.5.0","v9.5.0-rc.1","v9.5.1","v9.6.0","v9.6.0-rc.1","v9.7.0","v9.7.0-rc.1","v9.8.0","v9.8.0-rc.1","v9.9.0","v9.9.0-rc.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39251.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/commit/a587d7c36026fe1fcf93dfff63588abee359be76"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/releases/tag/v19.7.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-r48r-j8fx-mq2c"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-35"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287","CWE-322"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
