between inline data destruction and block mapping.\n\nThe function ext4_destroy_inline_data_nolock() changes the inode data\nlayout by clearing EXT4_INODE_INLINE_DATA and setting EXT4_INODE_EXTENTS.\nAt the same time, another thread may execute ext4_map_blocks(), which\ntests EXT4_INODE_EXTENTS to decide whether to call ext4_ext_map_blocks()\nor ext4_ind_map_blocks().\n\nWithout i_data_sem protection, ext4_ind_map_blocks() may receive inode\nwith EXT4_INODE_EXTENTS flag and triggering assert.\n\nkernel BUG at fs/ext4/indirect.c:546!\nEXT4-fs
