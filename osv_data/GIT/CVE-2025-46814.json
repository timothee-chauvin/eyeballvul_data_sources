An HTTP header injection vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 2.0.0. By manipulating the X-Forwarded-For header, an attacker can potentially inject arbitrary IP addresses into the request. This vulnerability can allow attackers to bypass IP-based access controls, mislead logging systems, and impersonate trusted clients. It is especially impactful when the application relies on the X-Forwarded-For header for IP-based authorization or authentication. Users should upgrade to FastAPI Guard version 2.0.0 to receive a fix.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rennf93/fastapi-guard","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0b003fda4c678c1b514e95f319aee88113e9bf4b"}]}],"versions":["0.2.0","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.3.3","0.3.4","0.4.0","1.0.0","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.3.2","1.4.0","1.5.0","v0.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-46814.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rennf93/fastapi-guard/security/advisories/GHSA-77q8-qmj7-x7pp"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rennf93/fastapi-guard/commit/0b003fda4c678c1b514e95f319aee88113e9bf4b"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-74"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
