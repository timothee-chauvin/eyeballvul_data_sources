{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-47930","published":"2025-05-15T23:17:29.829Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:17:46.842813Z","aliases":["GHSA-rqg7-xfqg-v7q5"],"summary":"Zulip Server has access control bypass for restrictions on creation of specific channel types","details":"Zulip is an open-source team chat application. Starting in version 10.0 and prior to version 10.3, the \"Who can create public channels\" access control mechanism can be circumvented by creating a private or web-public channel, and then changing the channel privacy to public. A similar technique works for creating private channels without permission, though such a process requires either the API or modifying the HTML, as we do mark the \"private\" radio button as disabled in such cases. Version 10.3 contains a patch.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip","events":[{"introduced":"df1abeb8ed5f51d6e93114385ec637af9325962f"},{"fixed":"c1be5e676679752ba54d30be54c2c84a5cd46d21"}]}],"versions":["10.0","10.0-beta1","10.0-beta2","10.0-dev","10.1","10.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-47930.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/47xxx/CVE-2025-47930.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/d2ff4bda4c3efa30fc3ab1f151255cfdbf370f78"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-rqg7-xfqg-v7q5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47930"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://zulip.com/help/configure-who-can-create-channels"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/changelog.html#zulip-server-10-3"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-863"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/47xxx/CVE-2025-47930.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
