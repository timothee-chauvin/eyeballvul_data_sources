fix a Null pointer dereference vulnerability","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: fix a Null pointer dereference vulnerability\n\n[Why]\nA null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the AMD display driver's\n(DC module) cleanup function dc_destruct().\nWhen display control context (dc->ctx) construction fails\n(due to memory allocation failure), this pointer remains NULL.\nDuring subsequent error handling when dc_destruct() is called,\nthere's no NULL check before dereferencing the perf_trace member\n(dc->ctx->perf_trace), causing a kernel null pointer dereference crash.\n\n[How]\nCheck if dc->ctx is non-NULL before dereferencing.\n\n(Updated commit text and removed unnecessary error
