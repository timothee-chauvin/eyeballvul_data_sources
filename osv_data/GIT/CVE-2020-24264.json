{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2020-24264","published":"2021-03-16T15:15:12.607Z","modified":"2025-11-20T11:21:29.090525Z","details":"Portainer 1.24.1 and earlier is affected by incorrect access control that may lead to remote arbitrary code execution. The restriction checks for bind mounts are applied only on the client-side and not the server-side, which can lead to spawning a container with bind mount. Once such a container is spawned, it can be leveraged to break out of the container leading to complete Docker host machine takeover.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/portainer/portainer","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"f347d97dafa2563d04cec02e33db173cc1eee392"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.1.0","1.10.0","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.11.0","1.11.1","1.11.2","1.11.3","1.11.4","1.12.0","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.12.3","1.12.4","1.13.0","1.13.1","1.13.2","1.13.3","1.13.4","1.13.5","1.13.6","1.14.0","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.15.0","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.15.3","1.15.4","1.15.5","1.16.0","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.0","1.17.1","1.18.0","1.18.1","1.19.0","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.2.0","1.20.0","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.21.0","1.22.0","1.22.1","1.23.0","1.23.1","1.23.2","1.24.0","1.24.1","1.3.0","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.6.0","1.7.0","1.8.0","1.8.1","1.9.0","1.9.1","1.9.2","1.9.3","internal-1.2.0","internal-1.3.0","internal-1.4.0","internal-1.5.0","internal-1.6.0","v0.5","v0.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-24264.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4106"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
