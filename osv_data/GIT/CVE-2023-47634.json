{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-47634","published":"2024-02-20T16:37:51Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:15:41.202524Z","aliases":["GHSA-r275-j57c-7mf2"],"summary":"Decidim has race condition in Endorsements","details":"Decidim is a participatory democracy framework. Starting in version 0.10.0 and prior to versions 0.26.9, 0.27.5, and 0.28.0, a race condition in the endorsement of resources (for instance, a proposal) allows a user to make more than once endorsement. To exploit this vulnerability, the request to set an endorsement must be sent several times in parallel. Versions 0.26.9, 0.27.5, and 0.28.0 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable the Endorsement feature in the components.
