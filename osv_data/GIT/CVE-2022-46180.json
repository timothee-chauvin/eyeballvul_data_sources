Users of discourse-mermaid-theme-component version 1.0.0 who can create posts are able to inject arbitrary HTML on that post. The issue has been fixed on the `main` branch of the GitHub repository, with 1.1.0 named as a patched version. Admins can update the theme component through the admin UI. As a workaround, admins can temporarily disable discourse-mermaid-theme-component.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-mermaid-theme-component","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c10bc4a08bf865cee20e5d5dffba535762813f0f"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-46180.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/46xxx/CVE-2022-46180.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-mermaid-theme-component/commit/c10bc4a08bf865cee20e5d5dffba535762813f0f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-mermaid-theme-component/pull/14"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-mermaid-theme-component/security/advisories/GHSA-8437-hgcm-p3q3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46180"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-74"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/46xxx/CVE-2022-46180.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
