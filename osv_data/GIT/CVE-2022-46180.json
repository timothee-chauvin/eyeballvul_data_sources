Users of discourse-mermaid-theme-component version 1.0.0 who can create posts are able to inject arbitrary HTML on that post. The issue has been fixed on the `main` branch of the GitHub repository, with 1.1.0 named as a patched version. Admins can update the theme component through the admin UI. As a workaround, admins can temporarily disable discourse-mermaid-theme-component.",
