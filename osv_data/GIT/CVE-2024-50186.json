The problem is that commit did not fully address the\nproblem, as some pf->create implementations do not use sk_common_release\nin their error paths.\n\nFor example, we can use the same reproducer as in the above commit, but\nchanging ping to arping. arping uses AF_PACKET socket and if packet_create\nfails, it will just sk_free the allocated sk object.\n\nWhile we could chase all the pf->create implementations and make sure they\nNULL the freed sk object on error from the socket, we can't guarantee\nfuture protocols will not make the same mistake.\n\nSo it is easier to just explicitly NULL the sk pointer upon return from\npf->create in __sock_create. We do know that pf->create always releases the\nallocated sk object on error, so if the pointer is not NULL, it is\ndefinitely dangling.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"78e4aa528a7b1204219d808310524344f627d069"},{"fixed":"daf462ff3cde6ecf22b98d9ae770232c10d28de2"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"893eeba94c40d513cd0fe6539330ebdaea208c0e"},{"fixed":"b7d22a79ff4e962b8af5ffe623abd1d6c179eb9f"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"454c454ed645fed051216b79622f7cb69c1638f5"},{"fixed":"563e6892e21d6ecabdf62103fc4e7b326d212334"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"6cd4a78d962bebbaf8beb7d2ead3f34120e3f7b2"},{"fixed":"8e1b72fd74bf9da3b099d09857f4e7f114f38e12"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"6cd4a78d962bebbaf8beb7d2ead3f34120e3f7b2"},{"fixed":"631083143315d1b192bd7d915b967b37819e88ea"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"5dfe2408fd7dc4d2e7ac38a116ff0a37b1cfd3b9"}]}],"versions":["v2.6.12","v2.6.12-rc2","v2.6.12-rc3","v2.6.12-rc4","v2.6.12-rc5","v2.6.12-rc6","v2.6.13","v2.6.13-rc1","v2.6.13-rc2","v2.6.13-rc3","v2.6.13-rc4","v2.6.13-rc5","v2.6.13-rc6","v2.6.13-rc7","v2.6.14","v2.6.14-rc1","v2.6.14-rc2","v2.6.14-rc3","v2.6.14-rc4","v2.6.14-rc5","v2.6.15","v2.6.15-rc1","v2.6.15-rc2","v2.6.15-rc3","v2.6.15-rc4","v2.6.15-rc5","v2.6.15-rc6","v2.6.15-rc7","v2.6.16","v2.6.16-rc1","v2.6.16-rc2","v2.6.16-rc3","v2.6.16-rc4","v2.6.16-rc5","v2.6.16-rc6","v2.6.17","v2.6.17-rc1","v2.6.17-rc2","v2.6.17-rc3","v2.6.17-rc4","v2.6.17-rc5","v2.6.17-rc6","v2.6.18","v2.6.18-rc1","v2.6.18-rc2","v2.6.18-rc3","v2.6.18-rc4","v2.6.18-rc5","v2.6.18-rc6","v2.6.18-rc7","v2.6.19","v2.6.19-rc1","v2.6.19-rc2","v2.6.19-rc3","v2.6.19-rc4","v2.6.19-rc5","v2.6.19-rc6","v2.6.20","v2.6.20-rc1","v2.6.20-rc2","v2.6.20-rc3","v2.6.20-rc4","v2.6.20-rc5","v2.6.20-rc6","v2.6.20-rc7","v2.6.21","v2.6.21-rc1","v2.6.21-rc2","v2.6.21-rc3","v2.6.21-rc4","v2.6.21-rc5","v2.6.21-rc6","v2.6.21-rc7","v2.6.22","v2.6.22-rc1","v2.6.22-rc2","v2.6.22-rc3","v2.6.22-rc4","v2.6.22-rc5","v2.6.22-rc6","v2.6.22-rc7","v2.6.23","v2.6.23-rc1","v2.6.23-rc2","v2.6.23-rc3","v2.6.23-rc4","v2.6.23-rc5","v2.6.23-rc6","v2.6.23-rc7","v2.6.23-rc8","v2.6.23-rc9","v2.6.24","v2.6.24-rc1","v2.6.24-rc2","v2.6.24-rc3","v2.6.24-rc4","v2.6.24-rc5","v2.6.24-rc6","v2.6.24-rc7","v2.6.24-rc8","v2.6.25","v2.6.25-rc1","v2.6.25-rc2","v2.6.25-rc3","v2.6.25-rc4","v2.6.25-rc5","v2.6.25-rc6","v2.6.25-rc7","v2.6.25-rc8","v2.6.25-rc9","v2.6.26","v2.6.26-rc1","v2.6.26-rc2","v2.6.26-rc3","v2.6.26-rc4","v2.6.26-rc5","v2.6.26-rc6","v2.6.26-rc7","v2.6.26-rc8","v2.6.26-rc9","v2.6.27","v2.6.27-rc1","v2.6.27-rc2","v2.6.27-rc3","v2.6.27-rc4","v2.6.27-rc5","v2.6.27-rc6","v2.6.27-rc7","v2.6.27-rc8","v2.6.27-rc9","v2.6.28","v2.6.28-rc1","v2.6.28-rc2","v2.6.28-rc3","v2.6.28-rc4","v2.6.28-rc5","v2.6.28-rc6","v2.6.28-rc7","v2.6.28-rc8","v2.6.28-rc9","v2.6.29","v2.6.29-rc1","v2.6.29-rc2","v2.6.29-rc3","v2.6.29-rc4","v2.6.29-rc5","v2.6.29-rc6","v2.6.29-rc7","v2.6.29-rc8","v2.6.30","v2.6.30-rc1","v2.6.30-rc2","v2.6.30-rc3","v2.6.30-rc4","v2.6.30-rc5","v2.6.30-rc6","v2.6.30-rc7","v2.6.30-rc8","v2.6.31","v2.6.31-rc1","v2.6.31-rc2","v2.6.31-rc3","v2.6.31-rc4","v2.6.31-rc5","v2.6.31-rc6","v2.6.31-rc7","v2.6.31-rc8","v2.6.31-rc9","v2.6.32","v2.6.32-rc1","v2.6.32-rc2","v2.6.32-rc3","v2.6.32-rc4","v2.6.32-rc5","v2.6.32-rc6","v2.6.32-rc7","v2.6.32-rc8","v2.6.33","v2.6.33-rc1","v2.6.33-rc2","v2.6.33-rc3","v2.6.33-rc4","v2.6.33-rc5","v2.6.33-rc6","v2.6.33-rc7","v2.6.33-rc8","v2.6.34","v2.6.34-rc1","v2.6.34-rc2","v2.6.34-rc3","v2.6.34-rc4","v2.6.34-rc5","v2.6.34-rc6","v2.6.34-rc7","v2.6.35","v2.6.35-rc1","v2.6.35-rc2","v2.6.35-rc3","v2.6.35-rc4","v2.6.35-rc5","v2.6.35-rc6","v2.6.36","v2.6.36-rc1","v2.6.36-rc2","v2.6.36-rc3","v2.6.36-rc4","v2.6.36-rc5","v2.6.36-rc6","v2.6.36-rc7","v2.6.36-rc8","v2.6.37","v2.6.37-rc1","v2.6.37-rc2","v2.6.37-rc3","v2.6.37-rc4","v2.6.37-rc5","v2.6.37-rc6","v2.6.37-rc7","v2.6.37-rc8","v2.6.38","v2.6.38-rc1","v2.6.38-rc2","v2.6.38-rc3","v2.6.38-rc4","v2.6.38-rc5","v2.6.38-rc6","v2.6.38-rc7","v2.6.38-rc8","v2.6.39","v2.6.39-rc1","v2.6.39-rc2","v2.6.39-rc3","v2.6.39-rc4","v2.6.39-rc5","v2.6.39-rc6","v2.6.39-rc7","v3.0","v3.0-rc1","v3.0-rc2","v3.0-rc3","v3.0-rc4","v3.0-rc5","v3.0-rc6","v3.0-rc7","v3.1","v3.1-rc1","v3.1-rc10","v3.1-rc2","v3.1-rc3","v3.1-rc4","v3.1-rc5","v3.1-rc6","v3.1-rc7","v3.1-rc8","v3.1-rc9","v3.10","v3.10-rc1","v3.10-rc2","v3.10-rc3","v3.10-rc4","v3.10-rc5","v3.10-rc6","v3.10-rc7","v3.11","v3.11-rc1","v3.11-rc2","v3.11-rc3","v3.11-rc4","v3.11-rc5","v3.11-rc6","v3.11-rc7","v3.12","v3.12-rc1","v3.12-rc2","v3.12-rc3","v3.12-rc4","v3.12-rc5","v3.12-rc6","v3.12-rc7","v3.13","v3.13-rc1","v3.13-rc2","v3.13-rc3","v3.
