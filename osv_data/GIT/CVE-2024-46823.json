However, it is being used as\na driver name when calling 'kunit_driver_create' from\n'kunit_device_register'. It produces the kernel panic with KASAN\nenabled.\n\nSince this variable is used in one place only, remove it and pass the\ndevice name into kunit_device_register directly as an ascii string.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d03c720e03bd9bf0b784d80b5d3ede7e2daf3b6e"},{"fixed":"d1207f07decc66546a7fa463d2f335a856c986ef"},{"fixed":"92e9bac18124682c4b99ede9ee3bcdd68f121e92"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.10.1","v6.10.2","v6.10.3","v6.10.4","v6.10.5","v6.10.6","v6.10.7","v6.10.8","v6.10.9","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.7","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-46823.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.10.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-46823.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/92e9bac18124682c4b99ede9ee3bcdd68f121e92"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d1207f07decc66546a7fa463d2f335a856c986ef"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/46xxx/CVE-2024-46823.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/05/msg00045.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46823"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/46xxx/CVE-2024-46823.json"}}
