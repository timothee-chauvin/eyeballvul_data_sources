The library contains critical security issues and should not be used for production. The maintenance of the project has been discontinued. In vm2 for versions up to 3.9.19, `Promise` handler sanitization can be bypassed with the `@@species` accessor property allowing attackers to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code, potentially allowing remote code execution inside the context of vm2 sandbox. Version 3.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d9a1fde8ec5a5a9c9e5a69bf91d703950859d744"}]}],"versions":["3.9.10","3.9.11","3.9.12","3.9.13","3.9.14","3.9.15","3.9.16","3.9.17","3.9.18","3.9.19","3.9.3","3.9.4","3.9.5","3.9.6","3.9.7","3.9.8","3.9.9","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v3.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-37466.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/37xxx/CVE-2023-37466.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/commit/d9a1fde8ec5a5a9c9e5a69bf91d703950859d744"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/releases/tag/v3.10.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-cchq-frgv-rjh5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37466"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241108-0002/"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-94"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/37xxx/CVE-2023-37466.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
