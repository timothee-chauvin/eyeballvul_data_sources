Versions prior to 1.1.9 contain a privilege escalation vulnerability, allowing elevation to superuser inside PostgreSQL databases that use the aiven-extras package. The vulnerability leverages missing schema qualifiers on privileged functions called by the aiven-extras extension. A low privileged user can create objects that collide with existing function names, which will then be executed instead. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow a low privileged user to acquire `superuser` privileges, which would allow full, unrestricted access to all data and database functions. And could lead to arbitrary code execution or data access on the underlying host as the `postgres` user. The issue has been patched as of version 1.1.9.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/aiven/aiven-extras","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"36598ab226a258c8065a0aed44054089e6111241"}]}],"versions":["1.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.1.5","1.1.6","1.1.7","1.1.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-32305.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/aiven/aiven-extras/security/advisories/GHSA-7r4w-fw4h-67gp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230616-0006/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/aiven/aiven-extras/commit/8682ae01bec0791708bf25791786d776e2fb0250"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1321","CWE-20"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
