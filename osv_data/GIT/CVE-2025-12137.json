{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-12137","published":"2025-11-01T07:15:35.333Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:32:33.511539Z","details":"The Import WP – Export and Import CSV and XML files to WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read in all versions up to, and including, 2.14.16. This is due to the plugin's REST API endpoint accepting arbitrary absolute file paths without proper validation in the 'attach_file()' function when handling 'file_local' actions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem, including sensitive configuration files and system files via the 'local_url' parameter.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/importwp/importwp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"94cc524aa0c81be6463a9e8d154b00220e34709c"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.10","2.0.11","2.0.12","2.0.13","2.0.14","2.0.15","2.0.16","2.0.17","2.0.18","2.0.19","2.0.2","2.0.20","2.0.21","2.0.22","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.0.8","2.0.9","2.1.1","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.2.4","2.2.5","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.10","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","2.4.5","2.4.6","2.4.7","2.4.8","2.4.9","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.5.4","2.5.5","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.6.4","2.6.5","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.7.10","2.7.11","2.7.12","2.7.13","2.7.14","2.7.2","2.7.3","2.7.4","2.7.5","2.7.6","2.7.7","2.7.8","2.7.9","v0.1","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.1.9","v0.3","v0.3.1","v0.4.1","v0.5","v0.6","v0.7","v0.7.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-12137.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/jc-importer/trunk/class/Common/Filesystem/Filesystem.php#L212"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/jc-importer/trunk/class/Common/Filesystem/Filesystem.php#L56"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/jc-importer/trunk/class/Common/Importer/ImporterManager.php#L435"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/jc-importer/trunk/class/Common/Rest/RestManager.php#L1079"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3387749%40jc-importer&new=3387749%40jc-importer&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f10636ea-06aa-4186-a891-ed4bb0800c41?source=cve"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/importwp/importwp/commit/94cc524aa0c81be6463a9e8d154b00220e34709c"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
