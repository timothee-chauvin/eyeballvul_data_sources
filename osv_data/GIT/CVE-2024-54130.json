A segmentation fault occurs with ION-DTN BPv7 software version 4.1.3 when a bundle with a Destination Endpoint ID (EID) set to dtn:none is received. This causes the node to become unresponsive to incoming bundles, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.3s.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nasa-jpl/ion-dtn","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"236eec4f84c333b2886084f4b70435cb4b8e21b8"}]}],"versions":["IOS-4.0.0","IOS-4.0.2","IOS-4.1.1","ion-2.1.0","ion-2.2.0","ion-2.2.1","ion-2.2.1b","ion-2.3.0","ion-2.4.0","ion-2.4.1","ion-2.4.2","ion-2.5.0","ion-2.5.1","ion-2.5.2","ion-2.5.3","ion-3.0.0","ion-3.0.1","ion-3.0.2","ion-3.1.0","ion-3.1.1","ion-3.1.2","ion-3.1.3","ion-3.2.0","ion-3.2.1","ion-3.2.2","ion-3.3.0","ion-3.3.1","ion-3.4.0","ion-3.4.1","ion-3.5.0","ion-3.6.0","ion-3.6.0b","ion-3.6.1","ion-3.6.2","ion-3.7.0","ion-4.1.1-release","ion-open-source-4.1.1","ion-open-source-4.1.2","ion-open-source-4.1.3","patch-IOS-4.1.1-nm-patch1","patch-IOS-4.1.1-nm-patch2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-54130.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nasa-jpl/ION-DTN/security/advisories/GHSA-7pj7-hfwv-q3v6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H"}]}
