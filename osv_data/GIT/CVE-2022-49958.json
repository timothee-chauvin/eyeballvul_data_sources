But the other queues may be\nable to successfully attach to default qdisc.\n\nIn this case, the fallback to noqueue process will be triggered. If the\noriginal attached qdisc is not released and a new one is directly\nattached, this will cause netdevice reference leaks.\n\nThe following is the bug log:\n\nveth0: default qdisc (fq_codel) fail, fallback to noqueue\nunregister_netdevice: waiting for veth0 to become free.
