In 1.3.3 and earlier, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability persists in the Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity function due to an incomplete validation check on the fl (frame length) field. Although CVE-2025-29912 addressed an underflow issue involving fl, the patch fails to fully prevent unsafe calculations. As a result, an attacker can still craft malicious frames that cause a negative tf_payload_len, which is then interpreted as a large unsigned value, leading to a heap buffer overflow in a memcpy call.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nasa/cryptolib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"59d1bce7608c94c6131ef4877535075b0649799c"}]}],"versions":["v0.1-engineering-release","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-30356.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/commit/59d1bce7608c94c6131ef4877535075b0649799c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-6w2x-w7w3-85w2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-191","CWE-787"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
