{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-58768","published":"2025-09-09T20:19:52.122Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:20:43.615141Z","aliases":["GHSA-f7q5-vc93-wp6j"],"summary":"DeepChat's Mermaid rendering has XSS leading to RCE","details":"DeepChat is a smart assistant uses artificial intelligence. Prior to version 0.3.5, in the Mermaid chart rendering component, there is a risky operation of directly using `innerHTML` to set user content. Therefore, any malicious content rendered via Mermaid will directly trigger the exploit chain, leading to command execution. This vulnerability is primarily caused by a failure to fully address the existing XSS issue in the project, leading to another exploit chain. The exploit chain is consistent with the report GHSA-hqr4-4gfc-5p2j, executing arbitrary JavaScript code via XSS and arbitrary commands via exposed IPC. Version 0.3.5 contains an updated fix.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/thinkinaixyz/deepchat","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3dc73a9ddc1b634ef0c6cb6b037d11222273f3dd"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.10","v0.0.11","v0.0.12","v0.0.13","v0.0.14","v0.0.15","v0.0.16","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.9","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.0-1","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.3-1","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.8","v0.2.9","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58768.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/58xxx/CVE-2025-58768.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/deepchat/security/advisories/GHSA-f7q5-vc93-wp6j"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58768"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-94"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/58xxx/CVE-2025-58768.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
