So David suggests this patch by draining\nin-progress ->queue_rq() for solving this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"12f5b93145450c750f315657ef239a314811aeeb"},{"fixed":"7a73c54a3750895888ab586896736c9434e062a1"},{"fixed":"8b3d6b029a552d2978bbac275303d11419826a69"},{"fixed":"82c229476b8f6afd7e09bc4dc77d89dc19ff7688"}]}],"versions":["v4.17","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.10","v6.0.11","v6.0.12","v6.0.13","v6.0.14","v6.0.15","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.0.6","v6.0.7","v6.0.8","v6.0.9","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50554.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.16"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.1.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50554.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7a73c54a3750895888ab586896736c9434e062a1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/82c229476b8f6afd7e09bc4dc77d89dc19ff7688"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8b3d6b029a552d2978bbac275303d11419826a69"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50554.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50554"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50554.json"}}
