It\nwill call the count_max_entries() to find in an out-of-order date which\ncounting algorithm has O(n^2) complexity.\n\nTo make it faster, we sort the relocation list by info and addend. That\nway, to check for a duplicate relocation, it just needs to compare with\nthe previous entry. This reduces the complexity of the algorithm to O(n\n log n), as done in commit d4e0340919fb (\"arm64/module: Optimize module\nload time by optimizing PLT counting\"). This gives sinificant reduction\nin module load time for modules with large number of relocations.\n\nAfter applying this patch, the soft deadlock problem has been solved,\nand the kernel starts normally without \"Call Trace\".\n\nUsing the default configuration to test some modules, the results are as\nfollows:\n\nModule              Size\nip_tables           36K\nfat
