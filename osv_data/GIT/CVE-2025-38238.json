On send completion, this causes an attempt to\nfree the same frame twice that leads to a crash.\n\nFix crash by allocating separate frames for RHBA and RPA, and modify ABTS\nlogic accordingly.\n\nTested by checking MDS for FDMI information.\n\nTested by using instrumented driver to:\n\n - Drop PLOGI response\n - Drop RHBA response\n - Drop RPA response\n - Drop RHBA and RPA response\n - Drop PLOGI response + ABTS response\n - Drop RHBA response + ABTS response\n - Drop RPA response + ABTS response\n - Drop RHBA and RPA response + ABTS response for both of them","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"09c1e6ab4ab2a107d96f119950dc330e446dc2b0"},{"fixed":"09679e9abedfbc5a2590759a1a7893c1c26e6044"},{"fixed":"a35b29bdedb4d2ae3160d4d6684a6f1ecd9ca7c2"}]}],"versions":["v6.13","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.15.1","v6.15.2","v6.15.3","v6.15.4","v6.16-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38238.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.14.0"},{"fixed":"6.15.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38238.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/09679e9abedfbc5a2590759a1a7893c1c26e6044"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a35b29bdedb4d2ae3160d4d6684a6f1ecd9ca7c2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/38xxx/CVE-2025-38238.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38238"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/38xxx/CVE-2025-38238.json"}}
