{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-50256","published":"2025-09-15T14:02:39.052Z","modified":"2025-11-19T19:06:02.458532Z","summary":"drm/meson: remove drm bridges at aggregate driver unbind time","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/meson: remove drm bridges at aggregate driver unbind time\n\ndrm bridges added by meson_encoder_hdmi_init and meson_encoder_cvbs_init\nwere not manually removed at module unload time, which caused dangling\nreferences to freed memory to remain linked in the global bridge_list.\n\nWhen loading the driver modules back in, the same functions would again\ncall drm_bridge_add, and when traversing the global bridge_list, would\nend up peeking into freed memory.\n\nOnce again KASAN revealed the problem:\n\n[  +0.000095] =============================================================\n[  +0.000008] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in __list_add_valid+0x9c/0x120\n[  +0.000018] Read of size 8 at addr
