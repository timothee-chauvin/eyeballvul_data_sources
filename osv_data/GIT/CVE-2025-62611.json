Prior to version 0.3.0, the client-side settings are not checked before sending local files to MySQL server, which allows obtaining arbitrary files from the client using a rogue server. It is possible to create a rogue MySQL server that emulates authorization, ignores client flags and requests arbitrary files from the client by sending a LOAD_LOCAL instruction packet. This issue has been patched in version 0.3.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiomysql","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"32c4520dae3711367ded74a4726dcb8bb8919538"}]}],"versions":["0.0.7","v0.0.1","v0.0.12","v0.0.13","v0.0.14","v0.0.15","v0.0.16","v0.0.17","v0.0.18","v0.0.19","v0.0.2","v0.0.20","v0.0.21","v0.0.22","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9","v0.1.0","v0.1.0rc1","v0.1.0rc2","v0.1.1","v0.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62611.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiomysql/commit/32c4520dae3711367ded74a4726dcb8bb8919538"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiomysql/pull/1044"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiomysql/security/advisories/GHSA-r397-ff8c-wv2g"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-73"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
