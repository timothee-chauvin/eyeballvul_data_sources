The field becomes NULL when user space\nreleases the final GEM handle on the buffer object. This resulted\nin a NULL-pointer deref.\n\nWorkarounds in commit 5307dce878d4 (\"drm/gem: Acquire references on\nGEM handles for framebuffers\") and commit f6bfc9afc751 (\"drm/framebuffer:\nAcquire internal references on GEM handles\") only solved the problem\npartially. They especially don't work for buffer objects without a DRM\nframebuffer associated.\n\nHence, this revert to going back to using .import_attach->dmabuf.\n\nv3:\n- cc stable","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"1a148af06000e545e714fe3210af3d77ff903c11"},{"fixed":"291a77604858a8b47cf6640a12b76e97f99e00ed"},{"fixed":"6d496e9569983a0d7a05be6661126d0702cf94f7"}]}],"versions":["v6.14","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.15.1","v6.15.2","v6.15.3","v6.15.4","v6.15.5","v6.15.6","v6.15.7","v6.15.8","v6.16-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38669.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.15.0"},{"fixed":"6.15.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38669.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/291a77604858a8b47cf6640a12b76e97f99e00ed"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6d496e9569983a0d7a05be6661126d0702cf94f7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/38xxx/CVE-2025-38669.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38669"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/38xxx/CVE-2025-38669.json"}}
