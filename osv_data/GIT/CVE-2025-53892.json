{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-53892","published":"2025-07-16T13:42:09.383Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:38:18.149378Z","aliases":["GHSA-x8qp-wqqm-57ph"],"summary":"Intlify Vue I18n's escapeParameterHtml does not prevent DOM-based XSS via tag attributes like onerror","details":"Vue I18n is the internationalization plugin for Vue.js. The escapeParameterHtml: true option in Vue I18n is designed to protect against HTML/script injection by escaping interpolated parameters. However, starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.14.5, 10.0.8, and 11.1.0, this setting fails to prevent execution of certain tag-based payloads, such as <img src=x onerror=...>, if the interpolated value is inserted inside an HTML context using v-html. This may lead to a DOM-based XSS vulnerability, even when using escapeParameterHtml: true, if a translation string includes minor HTML and is rendered via v-html. Versions 9.14.5, 10.0.8, and 11.1.0 contain a fix for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n","events":[{"introduced":"f3567129d710d320f471361a3de22672e7e26c57"},{"fixed":"924596094e3123251efb3b0ae2d93bbd4a5742ce"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"9.0.0"},{"fixed":"9.14.5"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n","events":[{"introduced":"a0115961d4f9397e246c95cf9cb958beebff5da2"},{"fixed":"30971026b77c5985a4ad3d56c665bf77c2536be7"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"10.0.0"},{"fixed":"10.0.8"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n","events":[{"introduced":"2b986621ad04b10825dc61db18a82137470c3278"},{"fixed":"9dc7f4970081de867b474baa8c7fe965841ad0d1"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"11.0.0"},{"fixed":"11.1.0"}]}}],"versions":["v10.0.0","v10.0.1","v10.0.2","v10.0.3","v10.0.4","v10.0.5","v10.0.6","v10.0.7","v11.0.0","v11.0.1","v9.0.0","v9.1.0","v9.1.1","v9.1.2","v9.1.3","v9.1.4","v9.1.5","v9.1.6","v9.10.0","v9.10.1","v9.10.2","v9.11.0","v9.11.1","v9.12.0","v9.12.1","v9.13.0","v9.13.1","v9.14.0","v9.14.1","v9.14.2","v9.14.3","v9.14.4","v9.2.0","v9.2.0-alpha.1","v9.2.0-alpha.2","v9.2.0-alpha.3","v9.2.0-alpha.4","v9.2.0-alpha.5","v9.2.0-alpha.6","v9.2.0-alpha.7","v9.2.0-alpha.8","v9.2.0-alpha.9","v9.2.0-beta.1","v9.2.0-beta.10","v9.2.0-beta.11","v9.2.0-beta.12","v9.2.0-beta.13","v9.2.0-beta.14","v9.2.0-beta.15","v9.2.0-beta.16","v9.2.0-beta.17","v9.2.0-beta.18","v9.2.0-beta.19","v9.2.0-beta.2","v9.2.0-beta.20","v9.2.0-beta.21","v9.2.0-beta.22","v9.2.0-beta.23","v9.2.0-beta.24","v9.2.0-beta.25","v9.2.0-beta.26","v9.2.0-beta.27","v9.2.0-beta.28","v9.2.0-beta.29","v9.2.0-beta.3","v9.2.0-beta.30","v9.2.0-beta.31","v9.2.0-beta.32","v9.2.0-beta.33","v9.2.0-beta.34","v9.2.0-beta.35","v9.2.0-beta.36","v9.2.0-beta.37","v9.2.0-beta.38","v9.2.0-beta.39","v9.2.0-beta.4","v9.2.0-beta.40","v9.2.0-beta.5","v9.2.0-beta.6","v9.2.0-beta.7","v9.2.0-beta.8","v9.2.0-beta.9","v9.2.1","v9.2.2","v9.3.0","v9.3.0-beta.0","v9.3.0-beta.1","v9.3.0-beta.10","v9.3.0-beta.11","v9.3.0-beta.12","v9.3.0-beta.13","v9.3.0-beta.14","v9.3.0-beta.15","v9.3.0-beta.16","v9.3.0-beta.17","v9.3.0-beta.18","v9.3.0-beta.19","v9.3.0-beta.2","v9.3.0-beta.20","v9.3.0-beta.21","v9.3.0-beta.22","v9.3.0-beta.23","v9.3.0-beta.24","v9.3.0-beta.25","v9.3.0-beta.26","v9.3.0-beta.27","v9.3.0-beta.3","v9.3.0-beta.4","v9.3.0-beta.5","v9.3.0-beta.6","v9.3.0-beta.7","v9.3.0-beta.8","v9.3.0-beta.9","v9.4.0","v9.4.1","v9.5.0","v9.6.0","v9.6.1","v9.6.2","v9.6.3","v9.6.4","v9.6.5","v9.7.0","v9.7.1","v9.8.0","v9.9.0","v9.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53892.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n/commit/49f982443ab8fd94ecc427b265ce97d57df94d7e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n/commit/a47099619fb9b256e86341a8658ebe72e92ab099"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n/pull/2229"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n/pull/2230"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n/releases/tag/v10.0.8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n/releases/tag/v11.1.10"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n/releases/tag/v9.14.5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n/security/advisories/GHSA-x8qp-wqqm-57ph"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
