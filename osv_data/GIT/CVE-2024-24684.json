{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-24684","published":"2024-05-28T14:15:11Z","modified":"2025-10-21T17:35:42.644028Z","details":"Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the readOFF functionality of libigl v2.5.0. A specially crafted .off file can lead to stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.This vulnerability concerns the header parsing occuring while processing an `.off`  file via the `readOFF` function. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe can see above that at [0] a stack-based buffer called `comment` is defined with an hardcoded size of `1000 bytes`.  The call to `fscanf` at [1] is unsafe and if the first line of the header of the `.off` files is longer than 1000 bytes it will overflow the `header` buffer.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/libigl/libigl","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"fdaac01bcc52888994f7afd029dcc045dd408484"}]}],"versions":["v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-24684.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-1929"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-1929"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
