This results in\nlack of decrementing prog's refcnt (through bpf_prog_put)\nleaving the LSM program alive past the point of the expected lifecycle.\nThis fix allows for the decrement to take place.\n\n[0] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220628174314.1216643-4-sdf@google.com/","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"69fd337a975c7e690dfe49d9cb4fe5ba1e6db44e"},{"fixed":"82b39df5ddb298daaf6dc504032ff7eb027fa106"},{"fixed":"6a1504dd36cd9a0a69250d61da8bdb17b29f1fe8"},{"fixed":"e89f3edffb860a0f54a9ed16deadb7a4a1fa3862"}]}],"versions":["v5.19","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.10","v6.0.11","v6.0.12","v6.0.13","v6.0.14","v6.0.15","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.0.6","v6.0.7","v6.0.8","v6.0.9","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50855.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.16"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.1.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50855.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6a1504dd36cd9a0a69250d61da8bdb17b29f1fe8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/82b39df5ddb298daaf6dc504032ff7eb027fa106"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e89f3edffb860a0f54a9ed16deadb7a4a1fa3862"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50855.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50855"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50855.json"}}
