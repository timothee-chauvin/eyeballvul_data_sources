{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-8765","published":"2025-03-20T10:15:44Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:35:02Z","details":"In lunary-ai/lunary, the privilege check mechanism is flawed in version git afc5df4. The system incorrectly identifies certain endpoints as public if the path contains '/auth/' anywhere within it. This allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive endpoints by including '/auth/' in the path. As a result, attackers can obtain and modify sensitive data and utilize other organizations' resources without proper authentication.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7ff89b0304d191534b924cf063f3648206d497fa"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-8765.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/4908cfcf-607a-412a-9635-966cbb08bb49"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/7ff89b0304d191534b924cf063f3648206d497fa"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
