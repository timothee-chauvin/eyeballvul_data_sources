{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-29169","published":"2022-06-01T22:20:12Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:30:48.121268Z","aliases":["GHSA-rwrv-p665-4vwp"],"summary":"ReDoS on endpoint html5client/useragent in BigBlueButton","details":"BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions starting with 2.2 and prior to 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. By using specific a RegularExpression, an attacker can cause denial of service for the bbb-html5 service. The useragent library performs checking of device by parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of useragent.lookup() ). This function handles input by regexing and attackers can abuse that by providing some ReDos payload using `SmartWatch`. The maintainers removed `htmlclient/useragent` from versions 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2. As a workaround, disable NginX forwarding the requests to the handler according to the directions in the GitHub Security Advisory.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton","events":[{"introduced":"68e35c9d722e62892d2e885646a9eab3bf44f77d"},{"fixed":"e9df2db16f902a453a250819dffd8029f9ca956d"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton","events":[{"introduced":"72d5e54e3eb3cd442d23dc097158fe81f1efda82"},{"fixed":"eda21682ea3fd472c8d16fe7ec6bcf0f80370a6f"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton","events":[{"introduced":"60302d3e353cea201fbd02912302d7f040f0dc27"},{"fixed":"a2ef36723ac49176002cb96f16a205f0f11743c9"}]}],"versions":["v2.4.5","v2.4.6","v2.5-alpha-1","v2.5-alpha-2","v2.5-alpha-3","v2.5-alpha-4","v2.5.0-alpha.5","v2.5.0-alpha.6","v2.5.0-beta.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-29169.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-rwrv-p665-4vwp"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/14886"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/14896"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
