As of quinn-proto 0.11, it is possible for a server to `accept()`, `retry()`, `refuse()`, or `ignore()` an `Incoming` connection. However, calling `retry()` on an unvalidated connection exposes the server to a likely panic in the following situations:  1. Calling `refuse` or `ignore` on the resulting validated connection, if a duplicate initial packet is received. This issue can go undetected until a server's `refuse()`/`ignore()` code path is exercised, such as to stop a denial of service attack. 2. Accepting when the initial packet for the resulting validated connection fails to decrypt or exhausts connection IDs, if a similar initial packet that successfully decrypts and doesn't exhaust connection IDs is received. This issue can go undetected if clients are well-behaved. The former situation was observed in a real application, while the latter is only theoretical.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn","events":[{"introduced":"0e9a19665a8afc26d3ad66a6f7e8b361960d235b"},{"fixed":"c26e8cd2f781e2cf83aa6cac09fd051ddc25a4e8"}]}],"versions":["0.11.0","0.11.1","0.11.2","quinn-0.11.2","quinn-0.11.3","quinn-proto-0.11.3","quinn-proto-0.11.4","quinn-proto-0.11.5","quinn-proto-0.11.6","quinn-udp-0.5.2","quinn-udp-0.5.3","quinn-udp-0.5.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45311.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/security/advisories/GHSA-vr26-jcq5-fjj8"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/commit/e01609ccd8738bd438d86fa7185a0f85598cb58f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/blob/bb02a12a8435a7732a1d762783eeacbb7e50418e/quinn-proto/src/endpoint.rs#L213"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-670"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
