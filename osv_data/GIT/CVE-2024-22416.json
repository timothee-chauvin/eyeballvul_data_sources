The `pyload` API allows any API call to be made using GET requests. Since the session cookie is not set to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library up to severe attack possibilities via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. As a result any API call can be made via a CSRF attack by an unauthenticated user. This issue has been addressed in release `0.5.0b3.dev78`. All users are advised to upgrade.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pyload/pyload","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1374c824271cb7e927740664d06d2e577624ca3e"},{"fixed":"c7cdc18ad9134a75222974b39e8b427c4af845fc"}]}],"versions":["v0.1","v0.1.1","v0.2","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.3","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.4.8","v0.4.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-22416.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-pgpj-v85q-h5fm"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/1374c824271cb7e927740664d06d2e577624ca3e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/c7cdc18ad9134a75222974b39e8b427c4af845fc"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-352"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
