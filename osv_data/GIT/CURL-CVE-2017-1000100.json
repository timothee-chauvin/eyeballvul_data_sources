This too large value is then used in the\n`sendto()` call, making curl attempt to send more data than what is actually\nput into the buffer. The `sendto()` function then reads beyond the end of the\nheap based buffer.\n\nA malicious HTTP(S) server could redirect a vulnerable libcurl-using client to\na crafted TFTP URL (if the client has not restricted which protocols it allows\nredirects to) and trick it to send private memory contents to a remote server\nover UDP. Limit curl's redirect protocols with `--proto-redir` and libcurl's\nwith `CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"7.15.0"},{"fixed":"7.55.0"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git","events":[{"introduced":"56d9624b566ac15ffb4b4b6eef220a5000b767e0"},{"fixed":"358b2b131ad6c095696f20dcfa62b8305263f898"}]}],"versions":["7.54.1","7.54.0","7.53.1","7.53.0","7.52.1","7.52.0","7.51.0","7.50.3","7.50.2","7.50.1","7.50.0","7.49.1","7.49.0","7.48.0","7.47.1","7.47.0","7.46.0","7.45.0","7.44.0","7.43.0","7.42.1","7.42.0","7.41.0","7.40.0","7.39.0","7.38.0","7.37.1","7.37.0","7.36.0","7.35.0","7.34.0","7.33.0","7.32.0","7.31.0","7.30.0","7.29.0","7.28.1","7.28.0","7.27.0","7.26.0","7.25.0","7.24.0","7.23.1","7.23.0","7.22.0","7.21.7","7.21.6","7.21.5","7.21.4","7.21.3","7.21.2","7.21.1","7.21.0","7.20.1","7.20.0","7.19.7","7.19.6","7.19.5","7.19.4","7.19.3","7.19.2","7.19.1","7.19.0","7.18.2","7.18.1","7.18.0","7.17.1","7.17.0","7.16.4","7.16.3","7.16.2","7.16.1","7.16.0","7.15.5","7.15.4","7.15.3","7.15.2","7.15.1","7.15.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://curl.se/docs/CURL-CVE-2017-1000100.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["299649190253636648298373704767072212028","295307249874644216177103258783560139928","83874492656159097150290477829949816860","270941083274010498415793508909327083905"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CURL-CVE-2017-1000100-072906fe","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git/commit/358b2b131ad6c095696f20dcfa62b8305263f898","target":{"file":"lib/tftp.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"279178995567361826597018327790682454261","length":2738},"id":"CURL-CVE-2017-1000100-c9641619","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git/commit/358b2b131ad6c095696f20dcfa62b8305263f898","target":{"file":"lib/tftp.c","function":"tftp_send_first"}}]}}],"database_specific":{"CWE":{"desc":"Buffer Over-read","id":"CWE-126"},"URL":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2017-1000100.json","affects":"both","last_affected":"7.54.1","package":"curl","severity":"High","www":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2017-1000100.html"},"credits":[{"name":"Even Rouault","type":"FINDER"},{"name":"Daniel Stenberg","type":"REMEDIATION_DEVELOPER"}]}
