Versions 1.0.0-rc3 through 1.2.7, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.2, and 1.4.0-rc.1 through 1.4.0-rc.2, due to insufficient checks when bind-mounting `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` inside the container, an attacker can trick runc into bind-mounting paths which would normally be made read-only or be masked onto a path that the attacker can write to. This attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133, except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers that allocate a console). This happens after `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write to host files directly -- however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively). This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3 and 1.4.0-rc.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc","events":[{"introduced":"75f8da7c889acc4509a0cf6f0d3a8f9584778375"},{"fixed":"eeb7e6024f9ee43876301b1d23c353384fa6dcdd"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.0.0-rc3"},{"fixed":"1.2.8"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc","events":[{"introduced":"a00ce11e91eb54c9c1bdfd773d13d4cdd41bb206"},{"fixed":"d842d7719497cc3b774fd71620278ac9e17710e0"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.3.0-rc.1"},{"fixed":"1.3.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc","events":[{"introduced":"b2ec7f9201cd52f0e3a8d83bc0b25da41239cb2c"},{"fixed":"6c7d8ad6020f79a1c6cec2930f3016ee4c2e5138"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.4.0-rc.1"},{"fixed":"1.4.0-rc.3"}]}}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc10","v1.0.0-rc3","v1.0.0-rc4","v1.0.0-rc5","v1.0.0-rc6","v1.0.0-rc7","v1.0.0-rc8","v1.0.0-rc9","v1.0.0-rc90","v1.0.0-rc91","v1.0.0-rc92","v1.0.0-rc93","v1.0.0-rc94","v1.0.0-rc95","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc.1","v1.2.0-rc.2","v1.2.0-rc.3","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-rc.1","v1.3.0-rc.2","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.4.0-rc.1","v1.4.0-rc.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52565.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/52xxx/CVE-2025-52565.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/01de9d65dc72f67b256ef03f9bfb795a2bf143b4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/398955bccb7f20565c224a3064d331c19e422398"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/531ef794e4ecd628006a865ad334a048ee2b4b2e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/9be1dbf4ac67d9840a043ebd2df5c68f36705d1d"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/aee7d3fe355dd02939d44155e308ea0052e0d53a"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/db19bbed5348847da433faa9d69e9f90192bfa64"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/de87203e625cd7a27141fb5f2ad00a320c69c5e8"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/ff94f9991bd32076c871ef0ad8bc1b763458e480"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-qw9x-cqr3-wc7r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-52565"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-363","CWE-61"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/52xxx/CVE-2025-52565.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H"}]}
