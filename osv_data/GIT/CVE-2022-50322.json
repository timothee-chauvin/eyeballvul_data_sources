If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,\nwhich manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.\n\nmsc313_rtc_probe() was passing clk_disable_unprepare() directly, which\ndid not have matching prototypes for devm_add_action_or_reset()'s\ncallback argument. Refactor to use devm_clk_get_enabled() instead.\n\nThis was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strict\nflag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type,\nwhich only checks for type width mismatches.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"be7d9c9161b9c76edeff15e79edc2f256568fe05"},{"fixed":"5affaaf3334c9274131dae889ed79ea0553d61b4"},{"fixed":"ba50fee6b41bcbafaeed3c51f90d37d1480ff9a0"},{"fixed":"21b8a1dd56a163825e5749b303858fb902ebf198"}]}],"versions":["v5.15","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.10","v6.0.11","v6.0.12","v6.0.13","v6.0.14","v6.0.15","v6.0.16","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.0.6","v6.0.7","v6.0.8","v6.0.9","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50322.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.17"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.1.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50322.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/21b8a1dd56a163825e5749b303858fb902ebf198"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5affaaf3334c9274131dae889ed79ea0553d61b4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ba50fee6b41bcbafaeed3c51f90d37d1480ff9a0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50322.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50322"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50322.json"}}
