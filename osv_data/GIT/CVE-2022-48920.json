This change was made\nby commit ce8ea7cc6eb313 (\"btrfs: don't call btrfs_start_delalloc_roots\nin flushoncommit\"). After that change we started producing that warning,\nand every now and then a user reports this since the warning happens too\noften, it spams dmesg/syslog, and a user is unsure if this reflects any\nproblem that might compromise the filesystem's reliability.\n\nWe can not just lock the sb->s_umount semaphore before calling\nwriteback_inodes_sb(), because that would at least deadlock with\nfilesystem freezing, since at fs/super.c:freeze_super() sync_filesystem()\nis called while we are holding that semaphore in write mode, and that can\ntrigger a transaction commit, resulting in a deadlock. It would also\ntrigger the same type of deadlock in the unmount path. Possibly, it could\nalso introduce some other locking dependencies that lockdep would report.\n\nTo fix this call try_to_writeback_inodes_sb() instead of\nwriteback_inodes_sb(), because that will try to read lock sb->s_umount\nand then will only call writeback_inodes_sb() if it was able to lock it.\nThis is fine because the cases where it can't read lock sb->s_umount\nare during a filesystem unmount or during a filesystem freeze - in those\ncases sb->s_umount is write locked and sync_filesystem() is called, which\ncalls writeback_inodes_sb(). In other words, in all cases where we can't\ntake a read lock on sb->s_umount, writeback is already being triggered\nelsewhere.\n\nAn alternative would be to call btrfs_start_delalloc_roots() with a\nnumber of pages different from LONG_MAX, for example matching the number\nof delalloc bytes we currently have, in
