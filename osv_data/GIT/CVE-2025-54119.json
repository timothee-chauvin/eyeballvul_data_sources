{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-54119","published":"2025-08-05T00:12:52Z","modified":"2025-11-09T19:55:19.938043Z","aliases":["GHSA-vf2r-cxg9-p7rf"],"summary":"ADOdb's sqlite3 driver allows SQL injection","details":"ADOdb is a PHP database class library that provides abstractions for performing queries and managing databases. In versions 5.22.9 and below, improper escaping of a query parameter may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements when the code using ADOdb connects to a sqlite3 database and calls the metaColumns(), metaForeignKeys() or metaIndexes() methods with a crafted table name. This is fixed in version 5.22.10. To workaround this issue, only pass controlled data to metaColumns(), metaForeignKeys() and metaIndexes() method's $table parameter.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/adodb/adodb","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"38ce257600e67b1e854f2e9054166569cff4bf6b"}]}],"versions":["v5.00beta","v5.01beta","v5.02","v5.02a","v5.03","v5.04","v5.05","v5.06","v5.07","v5.08","v5.08a","v5.09","v5.09a","v5.10","v5.11","v5.12","v5.13","v5.14","v5.15","v5.16","v5.16a","v5.17","v5.18","v5.18a","v5.19","v5.20.0","v5.20.1","v5.20.10","v5.20.11","v5.20.12","v5.20.13","v5.20.14","v5.20.15","v5.20.16","v5.20.17","v5.20.18","v5.20.19","v5.20.2","v5.20.20","v5.20.21","v5.20.3","v5.20.4","v5.20.5","v5.20.6","v5.20.7","v5.20.8","v5.20.9","v5.21.0","v5.21.0-beta.1","v5.21.0-rc.1","v5.21.1","v5.21.2","v5.21.3","v5.21.4","v5.22.0","v5.22.1","v5.22.2","v5.22.3","v5.22.4","v5.22.5","v5.22.6","v5.22.7","v5.22.8","v5.22.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54119.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ADOdb/ADOdb/commit/5b8bd52cdcffefb4ecded1b399c98cfa516afe03"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/ADOdb/ADOdb/issues/1083"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ADOdb/ADOdb/security/advisories/GHSA-vf2r-cxg9-p7rf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/10/msg00020.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-89"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
