External authentication can be bypassed by downstream connections. Downstream clients can force invalid gRPC requests to be sent to ext_authz, circumventing ext_authz checks when failure_mode_allow is set to true. This issue has been addressed in released 1.29.1, 1.28.1, 1.27.3, and 1.26.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"a6d1d66a62b985baed414ba90ad0daebfc074664"},{"fixed":"4fda4d79d06e1bd59e591be3f348223495083648"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.29.0"},{"fixed":"1.29.1"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"b5ca88acee3453c9459474b8f22215796eff4dde"},{"fixed":"0de8b2b94c75dbe8c2f897058e16d23d959783fa"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.28.0"},{"fixed":"1.28.1"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"7bba38b743bb3bca22dffb4a21c38ccc155fbef8"},{"fixed":"0fd81ee7ffcd7cfc864094b24dc9b5c3ade89ff2"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.27.0"},{"fixed":"1.27.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a0e580408ef4568b0a16c6663b6d8ae0c46aba6a"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.26.7"}]}}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.17.0","v1.18.0","v1.18.1","v1.18.2","v1.19.0","v1.2.0","v1.20.0","v1.21.0","v1.22.0","v1.23.0","v1.24.0","v1.25.0","v1.26.0","v1.26.1","v1.26.2","v1.26.3","v1.26.4","v1.26.5","v1.26.6","v1.27.0","v1.27.1","v1.27.2","v1.28.0","v1.29.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-23324.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/29989f6cc8bfd8cd2ffcb7c42711eb02c7a5168a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-gq3v-vvhj-96j6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
