This is catastrophic for data integrity when iter->pos is not\naligned to a page, because daddr/saddr do not point to the same byte in\nthe file as iter->pos.  Hence we corrupt user data by copying it to the\nwrong place.\n\nIf iter->pos + iomap_length() in the _iter function not aligned to a\npage, then we fail to copy a full block, and only partially populate the\ndestination block.  This is catastrophic for data confidentiality\nbecause we expose stale pmem contents.\n\nFix both of these issues by aligning copy_pos/copy_len to a page\nboundary (remember, this is fsdax so 1 fsblock == 1 base page) so that\nwe always copy full blocks.\n\nWe're not done yet -- there's no call to invalidate_inode_pages2_range,\nso programs that have the file range mmap'd will continue accessing the\nold memory mapping after the file metadata updates have completed.\n\nBe careful with the return value -- if the unshare succeeds, we still\nneed to return the number of bytes that the iomap iter thinks we're\noperating on.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"1bec6782a25c9b92c203ea7a1b3e3dc6a468cbc4"},{"fixed":"bdbc96c23197d773a7d1bf03e4f11de593b0ff28"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d984648e428bf88cbd94ebe346c73632cb92fffb"},{"fixed":"9bc18bb476e50e32e5d08f2734d63d63e0fa528c"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d984648e428bf88cbd94ebe346c73632cb92fffb"},{"fixed":"8e9c0f500b42216ef930f5c0d1703989a451913d"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d984648e428bf88cbd94ebe346c73632cb92fffb"},{"fixed":"50793801fc7f6d08def48754fb0f0706b0cfc394"}]}],"versions":["v6.1","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.11.1","v6.11.2","v6.11.3","v6.11.4","v6.11.5","v6.11.6","v6.12-rc1","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.5","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.59","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-50250.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.116"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.60"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.11.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-50250.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/50793801fc7f6d08def48754fb0f0706b0cfc394"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8e9c0f500b42216ef930f5c0d1703989a451913d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9bc18bb476e50e32e5d08f2734d63d63e0fa528c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bdbc96c23197d773a7d1bf03e4f11de593b0ff28"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
