However, this wait can be infinite and results\nin deadlock because of circular dependency among the quota disable\nioctl, the qgroup rescan worker and the other task with transaction such\nas block group relocation task.\n\nThe deadlock happens with the steps following:\n\n1) Task A calls ioctl to disable quota. It starts a transaction and\n   waits for qgroup rescan worker completes.\n2) Task B such as block group relocation task starts a transaction and\n   joins to the transaction that task A started. Then task B commits to\n   the transaction. In this commit, task B waits for a commit by task A.\n3) Task C as the qgroup rescan worker starts its job and starts a\n   transaction. In this transaction start, task C waits for completion\n   of the transaction that task A started and task B committed.\n\nThis deadlock was found with fstests test case btrfs/115 and a zoned\nnull_blk device. The test case enables and disables quota, and the\nblock group reclaim was triggered during the quota disable by chance.\nThe deadlock was also observed by running quota enable and disable in\nparallel with 'btrfs balance' command on regular null_blk devices.\n\nAn example report of the deadlock:\n\n  [372.469894] INFO: task kworker/u16:6:103 blocked for more than 122 seconds.\n
