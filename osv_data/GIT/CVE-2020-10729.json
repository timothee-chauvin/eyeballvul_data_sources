Two random password lookups of the same length generate the equal value as the template caching action for the same file since no re-evaluation happens. The highest threat from this vulnerability would be that all passwords are exposed at once for the file. This flaw affects Ansible Engine versions before 2.9.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ansible/ansible","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9e3ccd64b6a233390cd70c314193b6ba1aacfe21"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2","0.01","0.3","0.7","stable-2.9-branchpoint","v1.0","v1.1","v1.2","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1_last","v2.0.0-0.1.alpha1","v2.0.0-0.2.alpha2","v2.0.0-0.3.beta1","v2.0.0-0.4.beta2","v2.0.0-0.5.beta3","v2.6.0a1","v2.7.0.a1","v2.8.0a1","v2.9.0","v2.9.0b1","v2.9.0rc1","v2.9.0rc2","v2.9.0rc3","v2.9.0rc4","v2.9.0rc5","v2.9.1","v2.9.2","v2.9.3","v2.9.4","v2.9.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-10729.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1831089"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/34144"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4950"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
