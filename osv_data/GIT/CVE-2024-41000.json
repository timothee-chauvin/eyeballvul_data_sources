been\nchanged [1] in the newest version of Clang; It was re-enabled in the\nkernel with Commit 557f8c582a9ba8ab (\"ubsan: Reintroduce signed overflow\nsanitizer\").\n\nLet's rework this overflow checking logic to not actually perform an\noverflow during the check itself, thus avoiding the UBSAN splat.\n\n[1]:
