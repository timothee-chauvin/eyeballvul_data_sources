When mod_auth_openidc versions prior to 2.4.9 are configured to use an unencrypted Redis cache (`OIDCCacheEncrypt off`, `OIDCSessionType server-cache`, `OIDCCacheType redis`), `mod_auth_openidc` wrongly performed argument interpolation before passing Redis requests to `hiredis`, which would perform it again and lead to an uncontrolled format string bug. Initial assessment shows that this bug does not appear to allow gaining arbitrary code execution, but can reliably provoke a denial of service by repeatedly crashing the Apache workers. This bug has been corrected in version 2.4.9 by performing argument interpolation only once, using the `hiredis` API. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by setting `OIDCCacheEncrypt` to `on`, as cache keys are cryptographically hashed before use when this option is enabled.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openidc/mod_auth_openidc","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"dc672688dc1f2db7df8ad4abebc367116017a449"},{"fixed":"e33cd488cb9ce027dae692e06767a0ba7ed5e1de"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32785.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/httpd","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7ea253ccfeaec99b5684c909dce6d9a6d7ee6486"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32785.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/commit/dc672688dc1f2db7df8ad4abebc367116017a449"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/releases/tag/v2.4.9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/security/advisories/GHSA-55r8-6w97-xxr4"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00034.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210902-0001/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
