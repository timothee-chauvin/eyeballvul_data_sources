The FW recovery\nis triggered by ath10k_core_restart() which calls driver clean up via\nath10k_halt(). When the suspend event occurs between the FW recovery,\nthe restart worker thread is put into frozen state until suspend completes.\nThe suspend event triggers ath10k_stop() which again triggers ath10k_halt()\nThe double invocation of ath10k_halt() causes ath10k_htt_rx_free() to be\ncalled twice(Note: ath10k_htt_rx_alloc was not called by restart worker\nthread because of its frozen state), causing the crash.\n\nTo fix this, during the suspend flow, skip call to ath10k_halt() in\nath10k_stop() when the current driver state is ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING.\nAlso, for driver state ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING, call\nath10k_wait_for_suspend() in ath10k_stop(). This is because call to\nath10k_wait_for_suspend() is skipped later in\n[ath10k_halt() > ath10k_core_stop()] for the driver state\nATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING.\n\nThe frozen restart worker thread will be cancelled during resume when the\ndevice comes out of suspend.\n\nBelow is the crash stack for reference:\n\n[  428.469167] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  428.469180] kernel BUG at
