{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-45613","published":"2024-09-25T13:27:03.546Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:31:39.656847Z","aliases":["GHSA-rgg8-g5x8-wr9v"],"summary":"CKEditor 5 has Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in the clipboard package","details":"CKEditor 5 is a JavaScript rich-text editor. Starting in version 40.0.0 and prior to version 43.1.1, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present in the CKEditor 5 clipboard package. This vulnerability could be triggered by a specific user action, leading to unauthorized JavaScript code execution, if the attacker managed to insert a malicious content into the editor, which might happen with a very specific editor configuration. This vulnerability only affects installations where the Block Toolbar plugin is enabled and either the General HTML Support (with a configuration that permits unsafe markup) or the HTML Embed plugin is also enabled. A fix for the problem is available in version 43.1.1. As a workaround, one may disable the block toolbar plugin.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5","events":[{"introduced":"2a9b1de93d395bdf8d137a4d875a6b21129fa68a"},{"fixed":"6b1e550ba3eee4618f36258ee2ed7cbbc2361246"}]}],"versions":["v40.0.0","v40.1.0","v40.2.0","v41.0.0","v41.1.0","v41.2.0","v41.2.1","v41.3.0","v41.3.0-alpha.0","v41.3.0-alpha.1","v41.3.0-alpha.2","v41.3.0-alpha.3","v41.3.0-alpha.4","v41.3.1","v41.4.0","v41.4.0-alpha.0","v41.4.1","v41.4.2","v42.0.0","v42.0.1","v42.0.2","v43.0.0","v43.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45613.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/releases/tag/v43.1.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-rgg8-g5x8-wr9v"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
