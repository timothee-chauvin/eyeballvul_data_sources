Qcom-adm instead provide error\npointer when an error occur. This indirectly cause kernel panic for\nexample for the nandc driver that checks only if the pointer returned by\ndevice_prep_slave_sg is not NULL. Returning an error pointer makes nandc\nthink the device_prep_slave_sg function correctly completed and makes\nthe kernel panics later in the code.\n\nWhile nandc is the one that makes the kernel crash, it was pointed out\nthat the real problem is qcom-adm not following calling convention for\nthat function.\n\nTo fix this, drop returning error pointer and return NULL with an error\nlog.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"5c9f8c2dbdbe53818bcde6aa6695e1331e5f841f"},{"fixed":"5653bd0200944e5803fa8e32dc36aa49931312f9"},{"fixed":"9a041174c58a226e713f6cebd41eccec7a5cfa72"},{"fixed":"b9d2140c3badf4107973ad77c5a0ec3075705c85"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.19.1","v5.19.10","v5.19.11","v5.19.12","v5.19.13","v5.19.14","v5.19.15","v5.19.16","v5.19.2","v5.19.3","v5.19.4","v5.19.5","v5.19.6","v5.19.7","v5.19.8","v5.19.9","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50721.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.11.0"},{"fixed":"5.19.17"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.20.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50721.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5653bd0200944e5803fa8e32dc36aa49931312f9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9a041174c58a226e713f6cebd41eccec7a5cfa72"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b9d2140c3badf4107973ad77c5a0ec3075705c85"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50721.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50721"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50721.json"}}
