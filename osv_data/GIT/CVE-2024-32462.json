Normally, the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app, optionally along with some arguments. However it is possible to instead pass `bwrap` arguments to `--command=`, such as `--bind`. It's possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. When this is converted into a `--command` and arguments, it achieves the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap`, and thus can be used for a sandbox escape. The solution is to pass the `--` argument to `bwrap`, which makes it stop processing options. This has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0. All supported versions of Flatpak require at least that version of bubblewrap. xdg-desktop-portal version 1.18.4 will mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create .desktop files for commands that do not start with --. The vulnerability is patched in 1.15.8, 1.10.9, 1.12.9, and 1.14.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"627e42b5e2648feccd8c8fda0a129f7215998899"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak","events":[{"introduced":"0cfd72442dd7301b0699725e25eb0552da3b5e98"},{"fixed":"e7264e28ad3ede9439960c82cbdb59772080a579"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak","events":[{"introduced":"488038eed44c7edf334d1e28085975d96ce2bdcc"},{"fixed":"3344a7a72ff2e3e728e31c846fff42bda14429dd"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak","events":[{"introduced":"e084a4f14befc27d08094baba8cc8f714d7e417d"},{"fixed":"925c80f913d69e7ca424428823e1431c4ffb0deb"}]}],"versions":["0.1","0.10.0","0.10.1","0.10.2","0.11.1","0.11.2","0.11.3","0.11.4","0.11.5","0.11.6","0.11.7","0.11.8","0.11.8.1","0.11.8.2","0.11.8.3","0.2","0.2.1","0.3","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.3.3","0.3.4","0.3.5","0.3.6","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.10","0.4.11","0.4.12","0.4.13","0.4.2","0.4.2.1","0.4.3","0.4.4","0.4.5","0.4.6","0.4.7","0.4.8","0.4.9","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.5.2","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.10","0.6.11","0.6.12","0.6.13","0.6.14","0.6.2","0.6.3","0.6.4","0.6.5","0.6.6","0.6.7","0.6.8","0.6.9","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.9.1","0.9.10","0.9.11","0.9.12","0.9.2","0.9.3","0.9.4","0.9.5","0.9.6","0.9.7","0.9.8","0.9.9","0.9.98","0.9.98.1","0.9.98.2","0.9.99","0.99.1","0.99.2","0.99.3","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.10.0","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.10.3","1.10.4","1.10.5","1.10.6","1.10.7","1.10.8","1.12.0","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.12.3","1.12.4","1.12.5","1.12.6","1.12.7","1.12.8","1.14.0","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.14.5","1.15.0","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.15.3","1.15.4","1.15.6","1.15.7","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.7.3","1.8.0","1.9.1","1.9.2","1.9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-32462.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-phv6-cpc2-2fgj"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/72016e3fce8fcbeab707daf4f1a02b931fcc004d"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/81abe2a37d363f5099c3d0bdcd0caad6efc5bf97"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/b7c1a558e58aaeb1d007d29529bbb270dc4ff11e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/bbab7ed1e672356d1a78b422462b210e8e875931"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/18/5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IB6VQAF5S2YOBULDHPUKPOEIKONOP5KO/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZFNSCFJVMAQK5AF55JBN7OSJP3CREDBD/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-88"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
