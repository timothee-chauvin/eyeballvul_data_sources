{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62781","published":"2025-10-27T21:22:06Z","modified":"2025-10-29T02:40:14.601271Z","aliases":["GHSA-m8w5-8w3h-72wm"],"summary":"PILOS is missing session regeneration after password change","details":"PILOS (Platform for Interactive Live-Online Seminars) is a frontend for BigBlueButton. Prior to 4.8.0, users with a local account can change their password while logged in. When doing so, all other active sessions are terminated, except for the currently active one. However, the current sessionâ€™s token remains valid and is not refreshed. If an attacker has previously obtained this session token through another vulnerability, changing the password will not invalidate their access. As a result, the attacker can continue to act as the user even after the password has been changed. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.8.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/thm-health/pilos","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"abc974d1ed81995ff6cadf7184d5d5c11e57e215"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.8.0"}]}}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-RC.1","v2.0.0-RC.2","v2.0.0-RC.3","v2.0.0-RC.4","v2.0.0-alpha.1","v2.0.0-alpha.2","v2.0.0-alpha.3","v2.0.0-alpha.4","v2.0.0-alpha.5","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-RC.1","v4.0.0-RC.2","v4.0.0-RC.3","v4.0.0-RC.4","v4.0.0-beta.1","v4.0.0-beta.2","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.2.0","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.4.0","v4.5.0","v4.6.0","v4.6.1","v4.7.0","v4.7.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62781.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/THM-Health/PILOS/security/advisories/GHSA-m8w5-8w3h-72wm"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-613"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
