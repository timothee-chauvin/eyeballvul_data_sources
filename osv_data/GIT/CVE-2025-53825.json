{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-53825","published":"2025-07-14T22:44:22.246Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:38:14.213989Z","aliases":["GHSA-h67g-mpq5-6ph5"],"summary":"Dokploy's Preview Deployments are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution","details":"Dokploy is a free, self-hostable Platform as a Service (PaaS). Prior to version 0.24.3, an unauthenticated preview deployment vulnerability in Dokploy allows any user to execute arbitrary code and access sensitive environment variables by simply opening a pull request on a public repository. This exposes secrets and potentially enables remote code execution, putting all public Dokploy users using these preview deployments at risk. Version 0.24.3 contains a fix for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dokploy/dokploy","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"fdc524d79d0f65d9f99fe7751581473fe80bfcbc"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.10","v0.10.2","v0.10.3","v0.10.4","v0.10.5","v0.10.6","v0.10.7","v0.10.9","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.11.2","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.17.3","v0.17.4","v0.17.5","v0.17.6","v0.17.7","v0.17.8","v0.17.9","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.18.3","v0.18.4","v0.19.0","v0.19.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.20.3","v0.20.4","v0.20.5","v0.20.6","v0.20.7","v0.20.8","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.21.2","v0.21.3","v0.21.4","v0.21.5","v0.21.6","v0.21.7","v0.21.8","v0.22.0","v0.22.1","v0.22.2","v0.22.3","v0.22.4","v0.22.5","v0.22.6","v0.22.7","v0.23.0","v0.23.1","v0.23.2","v0.23.3","v0.23.4","v0.23.5","v0.23.6","v0.23.7","v0.24.0","v0.24.1","v0.24.2","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53825.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/commit/1977235d313824b9764f1a06785fb7f73ab7eba2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/security/advisories/GHSA-h67g-mpq5-6ph5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-862"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
