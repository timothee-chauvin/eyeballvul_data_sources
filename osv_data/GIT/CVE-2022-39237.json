In versions prior to 2.8.1the `github.com/sylabs/sif/v2/pkg/integrity` package did not verify that the hash algorithm(s) used are cryptographically secure when verifying digital signatures. A patch is available in version >= v2.8.1 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may independently validate that the hash algorithm(s) used for metadata digest(s) and signature hash are cryptographically secure.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sylabs/sif","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"07fb86029a12e3210f6131e065570124605daeaa"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.10","v1.0.3","v1.0.3-beta.1","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha.1","v2.0.0-alpha.2","v2.0.0-alpha.3","v2.0.0-alpha.4","v2.0.0-alpha.5","v2.0.0-beta.1","v2.0.0-beta.2","v2.0.0-beta.3","v2.0.0-beta.4","v2.0.0-beta.5","v2.0.0-beta.6","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.7.2","v2.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39237.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sylabs/sif/commit/07fb86029a12e3210f6131e065570124605daeaa"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sylabs/sif/security/advisories/GHSA-m5m3-46gj-wch8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-19"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-347"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
