{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-36124","published":"2024-06-03T14:25:58.628Z","modified":"2025-12-05T04:54:13.350491Z","aliases":["GHSA-8wh2-6qhj-h7j9"],"summary":"iq80 Snappy has an out-of-bounds read when uncompressing data, leading to JVM crash","details":"iq80 Snappy is a compression/decompression library. When uncompressing certain data, Snappy tries to read outside the bounds of the given byte arrays. Because Snappy uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. iq80 Snappy is not actively maintained anymore. As quick fix users can upgrade to version 0.5.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dain/snappy","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"fc4decaac1bb21268c4e80d8a4fbbf5cda82ba91"}]}],"versions":["snappy-0.1","snappy-0.2","snappy-0.3","snappy-0.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-36124.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/36xxx/CVE-2024-36124.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/dain/snappy/security/advisories/GHSA-8wh2-6qhj-h7j9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36124"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-125"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/36xxx/CVE-2024-36124.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
