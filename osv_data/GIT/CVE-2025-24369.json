Anubis allows attackers to bypass the bot protection by requesting a challenge, formulates any nonce (such as 42069), and then passes the challenge with difficulty zero. Commit e09d0226a628f04b1d80fd83bee777894a45cd02 fixes this behavior by not using a client-specified difficulty value.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xe/x","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7bd7b209f4f1b897de85ec8973458dc8be606a8b"},{"fixed":"e09d0226a628f04b1d80fd83bee777894a45cd02"}]}],"versions":["docker-base-layer","v1.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.1-1-g95fdc95","v1.1.1-2-g18a0ab4","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.1.8","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-24369.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/24xxx/CVE-2025-24369.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Xe/x/commit/7bd7b209f4f1b897de85ec8973458dc8be606a8b"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Xe/x/commit/e09d0226a628f04b1d80fd83bee777894a45cd02"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Xe/x/security/advisories/GHSA-56w8-8ppj-2p4f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24369"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://xeiaso.net/notes/2025/GHSA-56w8-8ppj-2p4f"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-807"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/24xxx/CVE-2025-24369.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
