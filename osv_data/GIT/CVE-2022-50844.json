If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,\nwhich manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed. A\nproposed warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which\nreveals:\n\n  drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../pm/swsmu/amdgpu_smu.c:3008:29: error: incompatible function pointer types initializing 'int (*)(void *, uint32_t, long *, uint32_t)' (aka 'int (*)(void *, unsigned int, long *, unsigned int)') with an expression of type 'int (void *, enum PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND, long *, uint32_t)' (aka 'int (void *, enum PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND, long *, unsigned int)') [-Werror,-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types-strict]\n          .odn_edit_dpm_table      = smu_od_edit_dpm_table,\n                                     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  1 error generated.\n\nThere are only two implementations of ->odn_edit_dpm_table() in 'struct\namd_pm_funcs': smu_od_edit_dpm_table() and pp_odn_edit_dpm_table().
