{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-53643","published":"2025-07-14T20:17:18Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:38:23.577790Z","aliases":["GHSA-9548-qrrj-x5pj"],"related":["CGA-9qh3-hfch-g4rf","CGA-f59m-6vrr-qp9v"],"summary":"AIOHTTP is vulnerable to HTTP Request/Response Smuggling through incorrect parsing of chunked trailer sections","details":"AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Prior to version 3.12.14, the Python parser is vulnerable to a request smuggling vulnerability due to not parsing trailer sections of an HTTP request. If a pure Python version of aiohttp is installed (i.e. without the usual C extensions) or AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is enabled, then an attacker may be able to execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections. Version 3.12.14 contains a patch for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"90b6cf6f3e303309db6d388f1e53d0f30997e1c8"}]}],"versions":["0.15.2","0.8.2","1.3.0","2.0.0","2.0.0rc1","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.3-1","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","4v0.21.6","v.0.6.5","v0.1","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.14.4","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.15.3","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.16.3","v0.16.4","v0.16.5","v0.16.6","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.17.3","v0.17.4","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.18.3","v0.18.4","v0.19.0","v0.2","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.21.0","v0.21.0a0","v0.21.0a1","v0.21.0a2","v0.21.1","v0.21.2","v0.21.3","v0.21.4","v0.21.5","v0.21.6","v0.22.0","v0.22.0b0","v0.22.0b1","v0.22.0b2","v0.22.0b3","v0.22.0b4","v0.22.0b5","v0.22.0b6","v0.22.1","v0.22.2","v0.22.3","v0.22.4","v0.22.5","v0.3","v0.4","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.2.0","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.2.5","v2.3.0","v2.3.0a1","v2.3.0a2","v2.3.0a3","v2.3.0a4","v2.3.1","v2.3.10","v2.3.1a1","v2.3.2","v2.3.2b1","v2.3.2b2","v2.3.2b3","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.7","v2.3.8","v2.3.9","v3.0.0","v3.0.0b0","v3.0.0b1","v3.0.0b2","v3.0.0b3","v3.0.0b4","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.0.8","v3.0.9","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.10.0","v3.10.0b0","v3.10.0b1","v3.10.0rc0","v3.10.1","v3.10.10","v3.10.11","v3.10.11rc0","v3.10.2","v3.10.3","v3.10.4","v3.10.5","v3.10.6","v3.10.6rc0","v3.10.6rc1","v3.10.6rc2","v3.10.7","v3.10.8","v3.10.9","v3.11.0","v3.11.0b0","v3.11.0b1","v3.11.0b2","v3.11.0b3","v3.11.0b4","v3.11.0b5","v3.11.0rc0","v3.11.0rc1","v3.11.0rc2","v3.11.1","v3.11.10","v3.11.11","v3.11.12","v3.11.13","v3.11.14","v3.11.15","v3.11.16","v3.11.17","v3.11.18","v3.11.2","v3.11.3","v3.11.4","v3.11.5","v3.11.6","v3.11.7","v3.11.8","v3.11.9","v3.12.0","v3.12.0b0","v3.12.0b1","v3.12.0b2","v3.12.0b3","v3.12.0rc0","v3.12.0rc1","v3.12.1","v3.12.10","v3.12.11","v3.12.12","v3.12.13","v3.12.1rc0","v3.12.2","v3.12.3","v3.12.4","v3.12.5","v3.12.6","v3.12.7","v3.12.7rc0","v3.12.8","v3.12.9","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.1b1","v3.3.2","v3.3.2a0","v3.4.0","v3.4.0a0","v3.4.0a3","v3.4.0b1","v3.4.0b2","v3.4.1","v3.4.2","v3.4.3","v3.4.4","v3.5.0","v3.5.0a1","v3.5.0b1","v3.5.0b2","v3.5.0b3","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.5.3","v3.5.4","v3.6.0","v3.6.0a0","v3.6.0a1","v3.6.0a10","v3.6.0a11","v3.6.0a12","v3.6.0a2","v3.6.0a3","v3.6.0a4","v3.6.0a5","v3.6.0a6","v3.6.0a7","v3.6.0a8","v3.6.0a9","v3.6.0b0","v3.6.1","v3.6.1b3","v3.6.1b4","v3.6.2","v3.6.2a1","v3.6.2a2","v3.7.0","v3.7.0b0","v3.7.0b1","v3.7.1","v3.7.2","v3.7.3","v3.7.4","v3.7.4.post0","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.8.2","v3.8.2a0","v3.8.3","v3.9.0","v3.9.0b0","v3.9.0b1","v3.9.0rc0","v3.9.1","v3.9.2","v3.9.3","v3.9.4","v3.9.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53643.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/e8d774f635dc6d1cd3174d0e38891da5de0e2b6a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-9548-qrrj-x5pj"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-444"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
