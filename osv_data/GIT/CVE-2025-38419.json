Cleanup acquired resources when rproc_handle_resources() fails in rproc_attach()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nremoteproc: core: Cleanup acquired resources when rproc_handle_resources() fails in rproc_attach()\n\nWhen rproc->state = RPROC_DETACHED and rproc_attach() is used\nto attach to the remote processor, if rproc_handle_resources()\nreturns a failure, the resources allocated by imx_rproc_prepare()\nshould be released, otherwise the following memory leak will occur.\n\nSince almost the same thing is done in imx_rproc_prepare() and\nrproc_resource_cleanup(), Function rproc_resource_cleanup() is able\nto deal with empty lists so it is better to fix the \"goto\" statements\nin rproc_attach(). replace the \"unprepare_device\" goto statement with\n\"clean_up_resources\" and get rid of the \"unprepare_device\" label.\n\nunreferenced object 0xffff0000861c5d00 (size 128):\ncomm \"kworker/u12:3\", pid 59,
