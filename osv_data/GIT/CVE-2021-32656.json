  "id": "CVE-2021-32656",
  "details": "Nextcloud Server is a Nextcloud package that handles data storage. A vulnerability in federated share exists in versions prior to 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2. An attacker can gain access to basic information about users of a server by accessing a public link that a legitimate server user added as a federated share. This happens because Nextcloud supports sharing registered users with other Nextcloud servers, which can be done automatically when selecting the \"Add server automatically once a federated share was created successfully\" setting. The vulnerability is patched in versions 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2 As a workaround, disable \"Add server automatically once a federated share was created successfully\" in the Nextcloud settings.",
