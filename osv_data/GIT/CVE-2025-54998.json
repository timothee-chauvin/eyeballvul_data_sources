In versions 0.1.0 through 2.3.1, attackers could bypass the automatic user lockout mechanisms in the OpenBao Userpass or LDAP auth systems. This was caused by different aliasing between pre-flight and full login request user entity alias attributions. This is fixed in version 2.3.2. To work around this issue, existing users may apply rate-limiting quotas on the authentication endpoints:, see https://openbao.org/api-docs/system/rate-limit-quotas/.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openbao/openbao","events":[{"introduced":"cd1f974f367f282c3d6340fa6dc1dfb49772431c"},{"fixed":"b1a68f558c89d18d38fbb8675bb6fc1d90b71e98"}]}],"versions":["api/auth/approle/v0.1.0","api/auth/approle/v0.1.1","api/auth/approle/v0.2.0","api/auth/approle/v0.3.0","api/auth/approle/v0.4.0","api/auth/approle/v0.4.1","api/auth/approle/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/approle/v2.0.1","api/auth/approle/v2.2.0","api/auth/approle/v2.3.0","api/auth/approle/v2.3.1","api/auth/aws/v0.1.0","api/auth/aws/v0.2.0","api/auth/aws/v0.3.0","api/auth/aws/v0.4.0","api/auth/aws/v0.4.1","api/auth/aws/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/azure/v0.1.0","api/auth/azure/v0.2.0","api/auth/azure/v0.3.0","api/auth/azure/v0.4.0","api/auth/azure/v0.4.1","api/auth/azure/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/gcp/v0.1.0","api/auth/gcp/v0.2.0","api/auth/gcp/v0.3.0","api/auth/gcp/v0.4.0","api/auth/gcp/v0.4.1","api/auth/gcp/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/kubernetes/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/kubernetes/v2.0.1","api/auth/kubernetes/v2.2.0","api/auth/kubernetes/v2.3.0","api/auth/kubernetes/v2.3.1","api/auth/ldap/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/ldap/v2.0.1","api/auth/ldap/v2.2.0","api/auth/ldap/v2.3.0","api/auth/ldap/v2.3.1","api/auth/userpass/v0.1.0","api/auth/userpass/v0.2.0","api/auth/userpass/v0.3.0","api/auth/userpass/v0.4.0","api/auth/userpass/v0.4.1","api/auth/userpass/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/userpass/v2.0.1","api/auth/userpass/v2.2.0","api/auth/userpass/v2.3.0","api/auth/userpass/v2.3.1","api/v1.100.0-development20240408","api/v1.3.1","api/v1.5.0","api/v1.6.0","api/v1.7.0","api/v1.7.1","api/v1.7.2","api/v1.8.0","api/v1.8.1","api/v1.8.2","api/v1.8.3","api/v1.9.0","api/v1.9.1","api/v1.9.2","api/v2.0.1","api/v2.1.0","api/v2.2.0","api/v2.3.0","api/v2.3.1","before-plugin-removal","dev-namespaces-base-20250215","dev-namespaces-base-20250311","dev-namespaces-base-20250424","fork-point","sdk/v0.4.1","sdk/v0.5.0","sdk/v0.5.1","sdk/v0.5.3","sdk/v0.6.0","sdk/v0.6.1","sdk/v0.6.2","sdk/v0.7.0","sdk/v0.8.0","sdk/v0.9.0","sdk/v0.9.1","sdk/v1.100.0-development20240408","sdk/v2.0.1","sdk/v2.1.0","sdk/v2.2.0","sdk/v2.3.0","sdk/v2.3.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha20240329","v2.0.0-beta20240618","v2.1.0-beta20241114","v2.1.0-beta20241114.1","v2.1.0-beta20241114.2","v2.1.0-beta20241114.3","v2.2.0-beta20250213","v2.3.0","v2.3.0-beta20250528","v2.3.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54998.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2025-16-vault-userpass-and-ldap-user-lockout-bypass/76035"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/openbao/openbao/commit/c52795c1ef746c7f2c510f9225aa8ccbbd44f9fc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/openbao/openbao/security/advisories/GHSA-j3xv-7fxp-gfhx"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-307"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
