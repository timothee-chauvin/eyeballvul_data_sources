{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-20331","published":"2021-05-13T08:15:06.557Z","modified":"2025-11-20T11:32:16.918922Z","aliases":["GHSA-p9rv-qgqw-jx2w"],"details":"Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish events containing authentication-related data to a command listener configured by an application. The published events may contain security-sensitive data when commands such as \"saslStart\", \"saslContinue\", \"isMaster\", \"createUser\", and \"updateUser\" are executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver","events":[{"introduced":"e75af27dc5966e9315d04f73ffa2c42549318a02"},{"fixed":"a4a3888f4fb51bb518b1eb5002effc2d47f2ea6a"}]}],"versions":["v2.12.0","v2.12.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-20331.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-3521"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
