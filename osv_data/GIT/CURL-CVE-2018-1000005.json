  "summary": "HTTP/2 trailer out-of-bounds read",
  "details": "libcurl contains an out bounds read in code handling HTTP/2 trailers.\n\nIt was [reported](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an\nHTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one\nbyte less than required.\n\nThe problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2\ntrailer data once appended a string like `\":\"` to the target buffer, while\nthis was recently changed to `\": \"` (a space was added after the colon) but\nthe associated math was not updated correspondingly.\n\nWhen accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or\nthat the (too large) data gets passed to the libcurl callback. This might lead\nto a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a\nservice that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.",
