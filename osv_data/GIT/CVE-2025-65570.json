{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-65570","published":"2025-12-29T15:16:01.763Z","modified":"2026-01-03T05:45:24.189105Z","details":"A type confusion in jsish 2.0 allows incorrect control flow during execution of the OP_NEXT opcode. When an “instanceof” expression uses an array element access as the left-hand operand inside a for-in loop, the instructions implementation leaves an additional array reference on the stack rather than consuming it during OP_INSTANCEOF. As a result, OP_NEXT interprets the array as an iterator object and reads the iterCmd function pointer from an invalid structure, potentially causing a crash or enabling code execution depending on heap layout.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pcmacdon/jsish","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"8154b7673827f8707065ff61306b8dad89571be3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65570.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://blog.mcsky.ro/writeups/2025/11/15/inline8-writeup.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
