  "details": "libcurl contains a buffer overrun flaw in the IMAP handler.\n\nAn IMAP FETCH response line indicates the size of the returned data, in number\nof bytes. When that response says the data is zero bytes, libcurl would pass\non that (non-existing) data with a pointer and the size (zero) to the\ndeliver-data function.\n\nlibcurl's deliver-data function treats zero as a magic number and invokes\nstrlen() on the data to figure out the length. The strlen() is called on a\nheap based buffer that might not be zero terminated so libcurl might read\nbeyond the end of it into whatever memory lies after (or just crash) and then\ndeliver that to the application as if it was actually downloaded.",
