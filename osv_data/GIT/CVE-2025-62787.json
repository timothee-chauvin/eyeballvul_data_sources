{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62787","published":"2025-10-29T16:30:26.950Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:21:40.945386Z","aliases":["GHSA-3hhq-5367-98q6"],"summary":"Wazuh Vulnerable to Heap-based Buffer Over-read in DecodeWinevt","details":"Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. Prior to 4.10.2, a buffer over-read occurs in DecodeWinevt() when child_attr[p]->attributes[j] is accessed, because the corresponding index (j) is incorrect. A compromised agent can cause a READ operation beyond the end of the allocated buffer (which may contain sensitive information) by sending a specially crafted message to the wazuh manager. An attacker who is able to craft and send an agent message to the wazuh manager can cause a buffer over-read and potentially access sensitive data. While the buffer over-read is always triggered while resolving the arguments of mdebug2, specific configuration options (analysisd.debug=2) need to be in place for the respective data to be leaked. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.10.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6457e4af487b95e35155817110f352f2e30744de"}]}],"versions":["v1.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.1","v1.1.1","v2.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v3.0.0","v3.1.0","v3.10.0","v3.10.1","v3.10.2","v3.11.0","v3.11.1","v3.11.2","v3.11.3","v3.11.4","v3.12.0","v3.12.1","v3.12.2","v3.12.3","v3.13.0","v3.13.1","v3.13.2","v3.13.3","v3.13.4","v3.13.5","v3.13.6","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.2.3","v3.2.4","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.4.0","v3.5.0","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.7.2","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.8.2","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v3.9.2","v3.9.3","v3.9.4","v3.9.5","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.1.3","v4.1.4","v4.1.5","v4.10.0","v4.10.1","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.2.3","v4.2.4","v4.2.5","v4.2.6","v4.2.7","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.3.10","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v4.3.4","v4.3.5","v4.3.6","v4.3.7","v4.3.8","v4.3.9","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.4.2","v4.4.3","v4.4.4","v4.4.5","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.5.2","v4.5.3","v4.5.4","v4.6.0","v4.7.0","v4.7.1","v4.7.2","v4.7.3","v4.7.4","v4.7.5","v4.8.1","v4.8.2","v4.9.0","v4.9.1","v4.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62787.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/62xxx/CVE-2025-62787.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/commit/267d5d55de490469a9ec24a2b936bb3c5aa8fdda"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/security/advisories/GHSA-3hhq-5367-98q6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62787"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-126"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/62xxx/CVE-2025-62787.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
