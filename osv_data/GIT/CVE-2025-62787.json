{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62787","published":"2025-10-29T16:30:26Z","modified":"2025-10-31T04:20:27.372928Z","aliases":["GHSA-3hhq-5367-98q6"],"summary":"Wazuh Vulnerable to Heap-based Buffer Over-read in DecodeWinevt","details":"Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. Prior to 4.10.2, a buffer over-read occurs in DecodeWinevt() when child_attr[p]->attributes[j] is accessed, because the corresponding index (j) is incorrect. A compromised agent can cause a READ operation beyond the end of the allocated buffer (which may contain sensitive information) by sending a specially crafted message to the wazuh manager. An attacker who is able to craft and send an agent message to the wazuh manager can cause a buffer over-read and potentially access sensitive data. While the buffer over-read is always triggered while resolving the arguments of mdebug2, specific configuration options (analysisd.debug=2) need to be in place for the respective data to be leaked. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.10.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"267d5d55de490469a9ec24a2b936bb3c5aa8fdda"}]}],"versions":["v1.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.1","v1.1.1","v2.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v3.0.0","v3.1.0","v3.10.0","v3.10.1","v3.10.2","v3.11.0","v3.11.1","v3.11.2","v3.11.3","v3.11.4","v3.12.0","v3.12.1","v3.12.2","v3.12.3","v3.13.0","v3.13.1","v3.13.2","v3.13.3","v3.13.4","v3.13.5","v3.13.6","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.2.3","v3.2.4","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.4.0","v3.5.0","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.7.2","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.8.2","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v3.9.2","v3.9.3","v3.9.4","v3.9.5","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.1.3","v4.1.4","v4.1.5","v4.10.0","v4.10.1","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.2.3","v4.2.4","v4.2.5","v4.2.6","v4.2.7","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.3.10","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v4.3.4","v4.3.5","v4.3.6","v4.3.7","v4.3.8","v4.3.9","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.4.2","v4.4.3","v4.4.4","v4.4.5","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.5.2","v4.5.3","v4.5.4","v4.6.0","v4.7.0","v4.7.1","v4.7.2","v4.7.3","v4.7.4","v4.7.5","v4.8.1","v4.8.2","v4.9.0","v4.9.1","v4.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62787.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["295671279710798297216949797356203520820","182563635299212653900405823587373706054","74139753733910230675097986086013687320","116517282923970475737569754509933345094","131961060806476802652272564911909237914","304780822475478596185709763620685073725","297420604563576462139647381955519665086","266180808569292620500697620771670221815","166241214843493306959022298447709629114","330900176337990218710239125798228169840","194408125068337987390970293584190296938"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2025-62787-5f3efba4","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/commit/267d5d55de490469a9ec24a2b936bb3c5aa8fdda","target":{"file":"src/analysisd/decoders/winevtchannel.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"135074992941727985690269859277974197193","length":14429},"id":"CVE-2025-62787-a44516b2","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/commit/267d5d55de490469a9ec24a2b936bb3c5aa8fdda","target":{"file":"src/analysisd/decoders/winevtchannel.c","function":"DecodeWinevt"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/security/advisories/GHSA-3hhq-5367-98q6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/commit/267d5d55de490469a9ec24a2b936bb3c5aa8fdda"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-126"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
