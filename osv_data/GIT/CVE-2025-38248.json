The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in br_multicast_add_router.part.0+0x3f1/0x560\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffff888004a67328 by task ip/384\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n dump_stack\n---truncated---","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"2796d846d74a18cc6563e96eff8bf28c5e06f912"},{"fixed":"f05a4f9e959e0fc098046044c650acf897ea52d2"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"2796d846d74a18cc6563e96eff8bf28c5e06f912"},{"fixed":"7544f3f5b0b58c396f374d060898b5939da31709"}]}],"versions":["v5.14","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.15.1","v6.15.2","v6.15.3","v6.15.4","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38248.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.15.0"},{"fixed":"6.15.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38248.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7544f3f5b0b58c396f374d060898b5939da31709"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f05a4f9e959e0fc098046044c650acf897ea52d2"}]}
