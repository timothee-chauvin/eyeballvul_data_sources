{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-24818","published":"2023-04-24T14:23:44Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:36:08.571895Z","aliases":["GHSA-69h9-vj5r-xcg6"],"summary":"RIOT-OS vulnerable to null pointer dereference during fragment forwarding","details":"RIOT-OS, an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices, contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. Prior to version 2022.10, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a NULL pointer dereference. During forwarding of a fragment an uninitialized entry in the reassembly buffer is used. The NULL pointer dereference triggers a hard fault exception resulting in denial of service. Version 2022.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, disable support for fragmented IP datagrams or apply the patches manually.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/riot-os/riot","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"365fbed906226dc36f50b0929e07426acbcc1e7d"}]}],"versions":["2013.08","2014.01","2014.05","2014.12","2015.09-RC1","2015.12-RC1","2015.12-devel","2016.03-devel","2016.04-RC1","2016.07-RC1","2016.07-RC2","2016.07-devel","2016.10-RC1","2016.10-devel","2017.01-RC1","2017.01-devel","2017.04-RC1","2017.04-devel","2017.07-RC1","2017.07-devel","2017.10-RC1","2017.10-devel","2018.01-RC1","2018.01-devel","2018.04-RC1","2018.04-devel","2018.07-RC1","2018.07-devel","2018.10-RC1","2018.10-devel","2019.01-RC1","2019.01-devel","2019.04-RC1","2019.04-devel","2019.07-RC1","2019.07-devel","2019.10-RC1","2019.10-devel","2020.01-RC1","2020.01-devel","2020.04-RC1","2020.04-devel","2020.07-RC1","2020.07-devel","2020.10-RC1","2020.10-devel","2021.01-RC1","2021.01-devel","2021.04-RC1","2021.04-devel","2021.07-RC1","2021.07-devel","2021.10-RC1","2021.10-devel","2022.01-RC1","2022.01-devel","2022.04-RC1","2022.04-devel","2022.07-devel"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-24818.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-69h9-vj5r-xcg6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/0bec3e245ed3815ad6c8cae54673f0021777768b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/17c70f7ee0b1445f2941f516f264ed4a096e82b7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/aa27ed71fa3e5d48dee1748dcf27b6323ec98a33"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/4b23d93868a28edd8ebf2ff4ebe94540f2475008"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/f4df5b4c4f841ccb460930894cf68ab10b55b971"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/f4fb746d1acaacc962daeed3aa71aadfe307d20e"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
