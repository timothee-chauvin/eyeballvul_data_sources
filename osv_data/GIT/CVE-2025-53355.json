A command injection vulnerability exists in the mcp-server-kubernetes MCP Server. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.execSync, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cyanheads/git-mcp-server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0dbd6995ccdf76ab770b58013034365b2d06c4d9"}]}],"versions":["1.2.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.10","v2.0.11","v2.0.12","v2.0.14","v2.0.15","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.0.9","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53355.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ab165f5a0eea917fef5dbae954506fff6f4bf514"}]}],"versions":["0.2.4","0.2.5","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.4.0","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","2.0.0","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","2.4.5","2.4.6","2.4.7","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.5","v2.4.6","v2.4.7","v2.4.8","v2.4.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53355.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/53xxx/CVE-2025-53355.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes/commit/ab165f5a0eea917fef5dbae954506fff6f4bf514"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes/security/advisories/GHSA-gjv4-ghm7-q58q"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cyanheads/git-mcp-server/commit/0dbd6995ccdf76ab770b58013034365b2d06c4d9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53355"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-77"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/53xxx/CVE-2025-53355.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
