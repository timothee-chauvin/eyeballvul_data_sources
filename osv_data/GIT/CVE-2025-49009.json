A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 1.50.8 in `FacebookAuthFilter.java` results in a full request URL being logged during a failed request to a Facebook user profile. The log includes the user's access token in plain text. Since WARN-level logs are often retained in production and accessible to operators or log aggregation systems, this poses a risk of token exposure. Version 1.50.8 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/erudika/para","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9e782bef879aaa047374b3c7a70f183630204833"}]}],"versions":["v","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.10","v1.11","v1.12","v1.13","v1.14","v1.14.1","v1.15","v1.16","v1.16.1","v1.16.2","v1.17","v1.17.1","v1.18.0","v1.18.1","v1.18.2","v1.18.3","v1.18.4","v1.18.5","v1.18.6","v1.18.7","v1.18.8","v1.18.9","v1.19.0","v1.2.1","v1.20.0","v1.21.0","v1.21.1","v1.22.0","v1.23.0","v1.23.1","v1.24.0","v1.24.1","v1.24.2","v1.24.3","v1.24.4","v1.24.5","v1.24.6","v1.25.0","v1.25.1","v1.25.2","v1.25.3","v1.25.4","v1.25.5","v1.26.0","v1.26.1","v1.26.2","v1.27.0","v1.28.0","v1.28.1","v1.28.2","v1.28.3","v1.28.4","v1.28.5","v1.29.0","v1.29.1","v1.29.2","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.30.0","v1.30.1","v1.30.2","v1.31.0","v1.31.1","v1.31.2","v1.31.3","v1.32.0","v1.33.0","v1.33.1","v1.34.0","v1.34.1","v1.34.2","v1.34.3","v1.35.0","v1.36.0","v1.36.1","v1.37.0","v1.37.1","v1.38.0","v1.38.1","v1.38.2","v1.38.3","v1.38.4","v1.39.0","v1.39.1","v1.4.0","v1.40.0","v1.41.0","v1.41.1","v1.41.2","v1.41.3","v1.42.0","v1.42.1","v1.42.2","v1.43.0","v1.43.1","v1.43.2","v1.43.3","v1.43.4","v1.44.0","v1.45.0","v1.45.1","v1.45.10","v1.45.2","v1.45.3","v1.45.4","v1.45.5","v1.45.6","v1.45.7","v1.45.8","v1.45.9","v1.46.0","v1.46.1","v1.46.2","v1.46.3","v1.47.0","v1.47.1","v1.47.2","v1.48.0","v1.48.1","v1.48.2","v1.49.0","v1.49.1","v1.49.2","v1.49.3","v1.49.4","v1.49.5","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.50.0","v1.50.1","v1.50.2","v1.50.3","v1.50.4","v1.50.5","v1.50.6","v1.50.7","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v1.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-49009.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Erudika/para/commit/46a908d887da02037384193f70a69345f04887cf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Erudika/para/security/advisories/GHSA-qx7g-fx8q-545g"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-532"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
