It's a\nstale sysfs entry that should have been removed but remains with NULL\nops.  The commit changed the error handling to skip the entries after\na NULL con->wq, and this leaves the power device unreleased.\n\nFor addressing the regression, the straight revert is applied here.\nFurther code improvements can be done from the scratch again.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"87d0e2f41b8cc2018499be4e8003fa8c09b6f2fb"},{"fixed":"3d4044c9e6d2e3f11f1f8b5e0ee8647d3eb1afad"},{"fixed":"5f73aa2cf8bef4a39baa1591c3144ede4788826e"}]}],"versions":["v5.18","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.19.1","v5.19.2","v5.19.3","v5.19.4","v5.19.5","v5.19.6","v5.19.7","v6.0-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49944.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.19.0"},{"fixed":"5.19.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49944.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3d4044c9e6d2e3f11f1f8b5e0ee8647d3eb1afad"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f73aa2cf8bef4a39baa1591c3144ede4788826e"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49944.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49944"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49944.json"}}
