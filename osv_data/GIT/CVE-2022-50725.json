And the loop\nreleasing is wrong, although now NUM_FE is 1 so it won't cause problem.\n\nFix this by correctly releasing everything.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"f90cf6079bf67988f8b1ad1ade70fc89d0080905"},{"fixed":"0369af6fe33d4053899b121b32e91f870b2cf0ae"},{"fixed":"c290aa527fd832d278c6388a3ba53a9890fbd74a"},{"fixed":"06398ce69571a43a8a0dd0f1bfe35d221f726a6a"},{"fixed":"8a204a0b4a0d105229735222c515759ea2b126c1"},{"fixed":"ba8d9405935097e296bcf7a942c3a01df0edb865"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.10.1","v5.10.10","v5.10.100","v5.10.101","v5.10.102","v5.10.103","v5.10.104","v5.10.105","v5.10.106","v5.10.107","v5.10.108","v5.10.109","v5.10.11","v5.10.110","v5.10.111","v5.10.112","v5.10.113","v5.10.114","v5.10.115","v5.10.116","v5.10.117","v5.10.118","v5.10.119","v5.10.12","v5.10.120","v5.10.121","v5.10.122","v5.10.123","v5.10.124","v5.10.125","v5.10.126","v5.10.127","v5.10.128","v5.10.129","v5.10.13","v5.10.130","v5.10.131","v5.10.132","v5.10.133","v5.10.134","v5.10.135","v5.10.136","v5.10.137","v5.10.138","v5.10.139","v5.10.14","v5.10.140","v5.10.141","v5.10.142","v5.10.143","v5.10.144","v5.10.145","v5.10.146","v5.10.147","v5.10.148","v5.10.149","v5.10.15","v5.10.150","v5.10.151","v5.10.152","v5.10.153","v5.10.154","v5.10.155","v5.10.156","v5.10.157","v5.10.158","v5.10.159","v5.10.16","v5.10.160","v5.10.161","v5.10.162","v5.10.17","v5.10.18","v5.10.19","v5.10.2","v5.10.20","v5.10.21","v5.10.22","v5.10.23","v5.10.24","v5.10.25","v5.10.26","v5.10.27","v5.10.28","v5.10.29","v5.10.3","v5.10.30","v5.10.31","v5.10.32","v5.10.33","v5.10.34","v5.10.35","v5.10.36","v5.10.37","v5.10.38","v5.10.39","v5.10.4","v5.10.40","v5.10.41","v5.10.42","v5.10.43","v5.10.44","v5.10.45","v5.10.46","v5.10.47","v5.10.48","v5.10.49","v5.10.5","v5.10.50","v5.10.51","v5.10.52","v5.10.53","v5.10.54","v5.10.55","v5.10.56","v5.10.57","v5.10.58","v5.10.59","v5.10.6","v5.10.60","v5.10.61","v5.10.62","v5.10.63","v5.10.64","v5.10.65","v5.10.66","v5.10.67","v5.10.68","v5.10.69","v5.10.7","v5.10.70","v5.10.71","v5.10.72","v5.10.73","v5.10.74","v5.10.75","v5.10.76","v5.10.77","v5.10.78","v5.10.79","v5.10.8","v5.10.80","v5.10.81","v5.10.82","v5.10.83","v5.10.84","v5.10.85","v5.10.86","v5.10.87","v5.10.88","v5.10.89","v5.10.9","v5.10.90","v5.10.91","v5.10.92","v5.10.93","v5.10.94","v5.10.95","v5.10.96","v5.10.97","v5.10.98","v5.10.99","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.9","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.10","v6.0.11","v6.0.12","v6.0.13","v6.0.14","v6.0.15","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.0.6","v6.0.7","v6.0.8","v6.0.9","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50725.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.10.0"},{"fixed":"5.10.163"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.11.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.86"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.16
