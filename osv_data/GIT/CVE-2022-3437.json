The DES and Triple-DES decryption routines in the Heimdal GSSAPI library allow a length-limited write buffer overflow on malloc() allocated memory when presented with a maliciously small packet. This flaw allows a remote user to send specially crafted malicious data to the application, possibly resulting in a denial of service (DoS) attack.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/samba-team/samba","events":[{"introduced":"df33344d8eb40221d60c99931690703a11d91bc2"},{"fixed":"37595203ef30b1a631b94075328f8d0d604e6e71"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-3437.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-3437"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2137774"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-06"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-06"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230216-0008/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2022-3437.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/02/08/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00015.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
