[0]\n\nTo fix the issue, let's update unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb under the\nsk_receive_queue's lock and take it everywhere we touch oob_skb.\n\nNote that we defer kfree_skb() in manage_oob() to silence lockdep\nfalse-positive (See [1]).\n\n[0]:\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008\n PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode\n PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present
