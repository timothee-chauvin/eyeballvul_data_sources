With an object > 8M we therefore aren't properly\n    copying the pages. And then with an object > 64M we trigger the\n    GEM_BUG_ON(num_ccs_blks > NUM_CCS_BLKS_PER_XFER).\n\nSo it looks like our copy handling for any object > 8M (which is our\nCHUNK_SZ) is currently broken on DG2.\n\nTestcase: igt@gem_lmem_swapping\n(cherry picked from commit 8676145eb2f53a9940ff70910caf0125bd8a4bc2)","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"da0595ae91da837929a00470ab40546090e5b9ae"},{"fixed":"97434cb55bd884bd268626ec41489f79b261b2d4"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"da0595ae91da837929a00470ab40546090e5b9ae"},{"fixed":"8d905254162965c8e6be697d82c7dbf5d08f574d"}]}],"versions":["v5.18","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.19.1","v5.19.2","v5.19.3","v5.19.4","v5.19.5","v5.19.6","v5.19.7","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49963.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.19.0"},{"fixed":"5.19.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49963.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d905254162965c8e6be697d82c7dbf5d08f574d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/97434cb55bd884bd268626ec41489f79b261b2d4"}]}
