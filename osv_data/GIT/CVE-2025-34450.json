When processing crafted or excessively large raw RF input data, the application may write beyond the bounds of a stack buffer, resulting in memory corruption or a crash. This vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service and, under certain conditions, may be leveraged for further exploitation depending on the execution environment and available mitigations.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dd32/rtl_433","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"25e47f8"}]}],"versions":["0.01","0.1","push"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-34450.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/marlinkcyber/advisories/blob/main/advisories/MCSAID-2025-004-rtl_433-rfraw-parse-overflow.md"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/merbanan-rtl-433-stack-based-buffer-overflow"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/issues/3375"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/dd32/rtl_433/commit/25e47f8"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
