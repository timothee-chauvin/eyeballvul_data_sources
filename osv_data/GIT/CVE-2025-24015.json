{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-24015","published":"2025-06-03T22:48:52Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:45:38.254198Z","aliases":["GHSA-2x3r-hwv5-p32x"],"summary":"Deno's AES GCM authentication tags are not verified","details":"Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. Versions 1.46.0 through 2.1.6 have an issue that affects AES-256-GCM and AES-128-GCM in Deno in which the authentication tag is not being validated. This means tampered ciphertexts or incorrect keys might not be detected, which breaks the guarantees expected from AES-GCM. Older versions of Deno correctly threw errors in such cases, as does Node.js. Without authentication tag verification, AES-GCM degrades to essentially CTR mode, removing integrity protection. Authenticated data set with set_aad is also affected, as it is incorporated into the GCM hash (ghash) but this too is not validated, rendering AAD checks ineffective. Version 2.1.7 includes a patch that addresses this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/denoland/deno","events":[{"introduced":"3314a0ceb8f874986d5da9f36f683740bd813750"},{"fixed":"379079d9049499af660b70423aa7cc3aca0d5e52"}]}],"versions":["v1.46.0","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.1.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-24015.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-2x3r-hwv5-p32x"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/0d1beed"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/4f27d7cdc02e3edfb9d36275341fb8185d6e99ed"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/a4003a5292bd0affefad3ecb24a8732886900f67"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-347"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
