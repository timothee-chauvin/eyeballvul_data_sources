Prior to version 1.17.3, any authenticated user can upload a profile picture with a misleading file extension (e.g., .jpg.txt), resulting in a persistent 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to view or edit that user’s profile. This makes the profile permanently inaccessible via the UI for both users and administrators, constituting a Denial of Service (DoS) within the user management interface. This issue has been patched in version 1.17.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/part-db/part-db-server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"eb7aefb8c05c1562769db9331b62392d6c285520"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.0-beta.1","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.10.5","v1.10.6","v1.10.7","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.13.3","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.14.2","v1.14.3","v1.14.4","v1.14.5","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.15.2","v1.16.0","v1.16.1","v1.17.0","v1.17.1","v1.17.2","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.9.0","v1.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-55194.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/10exp_BS9kRKHrFSPjiA_ZYUVJbHN8doW/view"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Part-DB/Part-DB-server/commit/d370f976a7b0c19d502aadbaa0f93eb90c2a6ffa"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Part-DB/Part-DB-server/security/advisories/GHSA-7rv3-rcxv-69ww"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-248"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
