Starting in version 1.36.2 and prior to version 1.40.3, use of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, resulting in arbitrary code execution. Use of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, which is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions. This bug is known to be exploitable for both `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` implementations. Version 1.40.3 fixes this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/denoland/deno","events":[{"introduced":"a7f5244a72cc6c00949c02a180d0d9cdf2bf1672"},{"fixed":"887fd59486325ad99c183955b35fec07fd45516c"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-27934.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-416"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
