{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-61667","published":"2025-11-12T18:50:02.940Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:21:28.544051Z","aliases":["GHSA-6852-76c5-6cmg"],"summary":"Datadog Linux Host Agent affected by local privilege escalation due to insufficient pycache permissions","details":"The Datadog Agent collects events and metrics from hosts and sends them to Datadog. A vulnerability within the Datadog Linux Host Agent versions 7.65.0 through 7.70.2 exists due to insufficient permissions being set on the `opt/datadog-agent/python-scripts/__pycache__` directory during installation. Code in this directory is only run by the Agent during Agent install/upgrades.  This could allow an attacker with local access to modify files in this directory, which would then subsequently be run when the Agent is upgraded, resulting in local privilege escalation. This issue requires local access to the host and a valid low privilege account to be vulnerable. Note that this vulnerability only impacts the Linux Host Agent. Other variations of the Agent including the container, kubernetes, windows host and other agents are not impacted. Version 7.71.0 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/datadog/datadog-agent","events":[{"introduced":"6ce6e864fb1d16d5d492a8446b504449080a863e"},{"fixed":"d3d73218dbd3706d3e51d2f0ff9fa5e9f01638d7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-61667.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/61xxx/CVE-2025-61667.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/security/advisories/GHSA-6852-76c5-6cmg"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61667"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-276"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/61xxx/CVE-2025-61667.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
