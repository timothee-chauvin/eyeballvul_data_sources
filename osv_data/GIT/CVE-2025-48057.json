Prior to versions 2.12.12, 2.13.12, and 2.14.6, the VerifyCertificate() function can be tricked into incorrectly treating certificates as valid. This allows an attacker to send a malicious certificate request that is then treated as a renewal of an already existing certificate, resulting in the attacker obtaining a valid certificate that can be used to impersonate trusted nodes. This only occurs when Icinga 2 is built with OpenSSL older than version 1.1.0. This issue has been patched in versions 2.12.12, 2.13.12, and 2.14.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/icinga/icinga2","events":[{"introduced":"0d5802937ba274fd3b9e13a48c4638cc104ad577"},{"fixed":"e4d2788f0869808bccea67a041a347c4c6bc237b"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.14.0"},{"fixed":"2.14.6"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/icinga/icinga2","events":[{"introduced":"aaccd0448feff8769b3c825c5c13b9fd6fbeed27"},{"fixed":"ec09daa4a4e7ac400417eb6e3c762bd84bd73f80"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.13.0"},{"fixed":"2.13.12"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/icinga/icinga2","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a0ec7f6b2fc7d4caa050f7e353e4f53f1bc140b7"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12.12"}]}}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.10","v0.0.11","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-beta1","v2.0.0-beta2","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.10.2","v2.10.3","v2.10.4","v2.10.5","v2.11.0","v2.11.0-rc1","v2.12.0","v2.12.0-rc1","v2.12.1","v2.12.10","v2.12.11","v2.12.2","v2.12.3","v2.12.4","v2.12.5","v2.12.6","v2.12.7","v2.12.8","v2.12.9","v2.13.0","v2.13.1","v2.13.10","v2.13.11","v2.13.2","v2.13.3","v2.13.4","v2.13.5","v2.13.6","v2.13.7","v2.13.8","v2.13.9","v2.14.0","v2.14.1","v2.14.2","v2.14.3","v2.14.4","v2.14.5","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.10","v2.3.11","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.7","v2.3.8","v2.3.9","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.10","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.5","v2.4.6","v2.4.7","v2.4.8","v2.4.9","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v2.5.3","v2.5.4","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.6.3","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.7.2","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.8.3","v2.8.4","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v2.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48057.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/commit/34c93a2542bbe4e9886d15bc17ec929ead1aa152"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/commit/4023128be42b18a011dda71ddee9ca79955b89cb"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/commit/60f75f4a3d5cbb234eb3694ba7e9076a1a5b8776"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/commit/9ad5683aab9eb392c6737ff46c830a945c9e240f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/commit/9b2c05d0cc09210bdeade77cf9a73859250fc48d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/security/advisories/GHSA-7vcf-f5v9-3wr6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-296"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L"}]}
