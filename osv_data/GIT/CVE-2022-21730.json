The implementation of `FractionalAvgPoolGrad` does not consider cases where the input tensors are invalid allowing an attacker to read from outside of bounds of heap. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"002408c3696b173863228223d535f9de72a101a9"}]}],"versions":["0.12.0-rc0","0.12.0-rc1","0.12.1","0.5.0","0.6.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.0rc0","v0.11.0","v0.11.0rc0","v0.11.0rc1","v0.11.0rc2","v0.12.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0rc0","v0.9.0","v0.9.0rc0","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-alpha","v1.0.0-rc0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc0","v1.1.0-rc1","v1.1.0-rc2","v1.12.0","v1.12.0-rc0","v1.12.0-rc1","v1.12.0-rc2","v1.12.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc0","v1.2.0-rc1","v1.2.0-rc2","v1.3.0-rc0","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-rc0","v1.5.0-rc1","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc0","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.8.0","v1.8.0-rc0","v1.8.0-rc1","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-rc0","v1.9.0-rc1","v1.9.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-21730.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["247677733064133363475683240260350950079","211013169028212055174252685045313731666","266230621670766112629044256293834513472","138001233068085857899093132106338659661","295020665072851053248376231679122032908","287471620927681731142022172899417948574","43379296771201277499059477386726393225","325124972754513570642349772422466179569","274916756153020027763064138751819925387","302730438141544393839559997459488283121","145411662072066637421483808612396496692","287984889469641988231907685040575392199"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2022-21730-aa920a33","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/002408c3696b173863228223d535f9de72a101a9","target":{"file":"tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/21xxx/CVE-2022-21730.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L209-L360"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/002408c3696b173863228223d535f9de72a101a9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-vjg4-v33c-ggc4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21730"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/21xxx/CVE-2022-21730.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
