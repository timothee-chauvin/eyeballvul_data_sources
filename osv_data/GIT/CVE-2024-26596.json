But struct dsa_user_priv is fairly small,\nand p->dp means dereferencing 8 bytes starting with offset 16. Most\ndrivers allocate that much private memory anyway, making our access not\nfault, and we discard the bogus data quickly afterwards, so this wasn't\ncaught.\n\nBut the dummy interface is somewhat special in that it calls\nalloc_netdev() with a priv size of 0. So every netdev_priv() dereference\nis invalid, and we get this when we emit a NETDEV_PRECHANGEUPPER event\nwith a VLAN as its new upper:\n\n$ ip link add dummy1 type dummy\n$ ip link add link dummy1
