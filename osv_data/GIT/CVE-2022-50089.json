When btrfs can allocate bytes for one part\nof the split regions but fails for the other region (e.g. because of\n-ENOSPC), we return the error leaving the pages in the succeeded regions\nlocked. Technically, this occurs only when @unlock == 0. Otherwise, we\nunlock the pages in an allocated region after creating an ordered\nextent.\n\nConsidering the callers of cow_file_range(unlock=0) won't write out\nthe pages, we can unlock the pages on error exit from\ncow_file_range(). So, we can ensure all the pages except @locked_page\nare unlocked on error case.\n\nIn summary, cow_file_range now behaves like this:\n\n- page_started == 1 (return value)\n  - All the pages are unlocked. IO is started.\n- unlock == 1\n  - All the pages except @locked_page are unlocked in any case\n- unlock == 0\n  - On success, all the pages are locked for writing out them\n  - On failure, all the pages except @locked_page are unlocked","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"42c011000963442ce533d92a492c4a057b2f5a46"},{"fixed":"b367f125c80fa838eae49e3b138dc67dfc9f46ef"},{"fixed":"9535ec371d741fa037e37eddc0a5b25ba82d0027"},{"fixed":"e160aa87c87a9c4e0c8d1430235f715a3a91e2cd"},{"fixed":"9ce7466f372d83054c7494f6b3e4b9abaf3f0355"}]}],"versions":["v5.11","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.7","v5.15.8","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.18.1","v5.18.10","v5.18.11","v5.18.12","v5.18.13","v5.18.14","v5.18.15","v5.18.16","v5.18.17","v5.18.2","v5.18.3","v5.18.4","v5.18.5","v5.18.6","v5.18.7","v5.18.8","v5.18.9","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.19.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50089.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.12.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.61"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.18.18"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.19.0"},{"fixed":"5.19.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50089.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9535ec371d741fa037e37eddc0a5b25ba82d0027"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9ce7466f372d83054c7494f6b3e4b9abaf3f0355"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b367f125c80fa838eae49e3b138dc67dfc9f46ef"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e160aa87c87a9c4e0c8d1430235f715a3a91e2cd"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50089.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50089"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50089.json"}}
