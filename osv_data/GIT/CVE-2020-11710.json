{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2020-11710","published":"2020-04-12T17:15:10.737Z","modified":"2025-12-03T02:08:29.239668Z","details":"An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3. The admin API port may be accessible on interfaces other than 127.0.0.1. NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. “1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such, the description stating ‘An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3.’ is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a “Patch” link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing. However, instructions for how to protect the admin API were already well-documented here: https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/secure-admin-api/#network-layer-access-restrictions , which was first published back in 2017 (as shown in this commit: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949) Lastly, the hyperlink to https://github.com/Kong/kong (an unrelated Github Repo to this issue) on the Hyperlink list does not include any meaningful information on this topic.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kong/docker-kong","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"dfa095cadf7e8309155be51982d8720daf32e31c"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0beta-3","0.1.1beta-2","0.10.0","0.10.1","0.10.2","0.10.3","0.11.0","0.11.0-alpine","0.11.0rc2","0.11.1-alpine","0.15.0","0.2.0-2","0.2.1","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.5.2","0.5.3","0.5.4","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.7.0","0.8.0","0.8.2","0.9.0","0.9.1","0.9.2","0.9.3","0.9.4","0.9.5","0.9.6","0.9.7","0.9.8","0.9.9","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.1.0","1.1.0rc1","1.1.0rc2","1.2.0","1.2.0rc1","1.2.0rc2","1.3.0","1.3.0rc1","1.3.0rc2","1.4.0","1.4.0rc1","1.4.0rc2","1.4.1","1.5.0","2.0.0","2.0.0rc1","2.0.0rc2","2.0.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-11710.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kong/docs.konghq.com","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611"},{"fixed":"e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949"}]}],"versions":["1.0.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-11710.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong/commit/dfa095cadf7e8309155be51982d8720daf32e31c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Kong/kong"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
