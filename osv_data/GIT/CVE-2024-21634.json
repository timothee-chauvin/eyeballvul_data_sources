{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-21634","published":"2024-01-03T22:46:03Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:41:00.306916Z","aliases":["GHSA-264p-99wq-f4j6"],"related":["CGA-cjj6-rx8j-mcwv","CGA-qrmh-pg87-6p4r"],"summary":"Ion Java StackOverflow vulnerability","details":"Amazon Ion is a Java implementation of the Ion data notation. Prior to version 1.10.5, a potential denial-of-service issue exists in `ion-java` for applications that use `ion-java` to deserialize Ion text encoded data, or deserialize Ion text or binary encoded data into the `IonValue` model and then invoke certain `IonValue` methods on that in-memory representation. An actor could craft Ion data that, when loaded by the affected application and/or processed using the `IonValue` model, results in a `StackOverflowError` originating from the `ion-java` library. The patch is included in `ion-java` 1.10.5. As a workaround, do not load data which originated from an untrusted source or that could have been tampered with.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/amazon-ion/ion-java","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"019a6117fb99131f74f92ecf462169613234abbf"}]}],"versions":["com_amazon_ion_v1.4.0","com_amazon_ion_v1.5.0","com_amazon_ion_v1.5.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v1.9.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-21634.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/amazon-ion/ion-java/security/advisories/GHSA-264p-99wq-f4j6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
