However two states are not always\nconsistent and can make memory leak.\n\n 1) attr_name in ATTR_ROOT does not fit the condition it will set\n is_root = true but NI_FLAG_DIR is not set.\n 2) next attr_name in ATTR_ALLOC fits the condition and alloc\n ni->dir.alloc_run\n 3) in cleanup function ni_clear(), when NI_FLAG_DIR is set, it frees\n ni->dir.alloc_run, otherwise it frees ni->file.run\n 4) because NI_FLAG_DIR is not set in this case, ni->dir.alloc_run is\n leaked as kmemleak reported:\n\nunreferenced object 0xffff888003bc5480 (size 64):\n  backtrace:\n    [<000000003d42e6b0>]
