{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-47780","published":"2025-05-22T16:56:28Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:47:28.449353Z","aliases":["GHSA-c7p6-7mvq-8jq2"],"summary":"cli_permissions.conf: deny option does not work for disallowing shell commands","details":"Asterisk is an open-source private branch exchange (PBX). Prior to versions 18.26.2, 20.14.1, 21.9.1, and 22.4.1 of Asterisk and versions 18.9-cert14 and 20.7-cert5 of certified-asterisk, trying to disallow shell commands to be run via the Asterisk command line interface (CLI) by configuring `cli_permissions.conf` (e.g. with the config line `deny=!*`) does not work which could lead to a security risk. If an administrator running an Asterisk instance relies on the `cli_permissions.conf` file to work and expects it to deny all attempts to execute shell commands, then this could lead to a security vulnerability. Versions 18.26.2, 20.14.1, 21.9.1, and 22.4.1 of Asterisk and versions 18.9-cert14 and 20.7-cert5 of certified-asterisk fix the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"aa7d07fd5604040dfeb5747049b048235bc5c8c0"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"b8510b0e4bd13cbda505787ccb1e17354525a844"},{"fixed":"0376da363c48289070211b76c220f6a7cddbda18"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"c6c7103efa6605a6db7ca28b4b17cd2d1c15a05c"},{"fixed":"acff0dda80947e777120374e0aff8cd913c0e564"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"c98d80eaaca62d71bab64a84a911b36868aef5bd"},{"fixed":"6657e9766d05771c514b8bff7a3e51bd3ed18d1b"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"12da95e53ff42287ad69d6d5922e06c3d62010ac"},{"fixed":"5d8b6b4f8c66bbab9ef93b1765960232a6828209"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"8e4a09f71162ebc1e4bb2159dfc638aa2328047c"},{"fixed":"4b77b570e6b0308118f1ad9596ba60456ed80834"}]}],"versions":["18.9.0","18.9.0-rc1","20.10.0","20.10.0-rc1","20.10.0-rc2","20.11.0","20.11.0-rc1","20.11.1","20.12.0","20.12.0-rc1","20.12.0-rc2","20.13.0","20.13.0-rc1","20.14.0","20.14.0-rc1","20.8.0","20.8.1","20.9.0","20.9.0-rc1","20.9.1","20.9.2","20.9.3","21.0.0","21.0.1","21.0.2","21.1.0","21.1.0-rc1","21.1.0-rc2","21.2.0","21.2.0-rc1","21.2.0-rc2","21.3.0","21.3.0-rc1","21.3.1","21.4.0","21.4.0-rc1","21.4.1","21.4.2","21.4.3","21.5.0","21.5.0-rc1","21.5.0-rc2","21.6.0","21.6.0-rc1","21.6.1","21.7.0","21.7.0-rc1","21.7.0-rc2","21.8.0","21.8.0-rc1","21.9.0","21.9.0-rc1","22.0.0","22.1.0","22.1.0-rc1","22.1.1","22.2.0","22.2.0-rc1","22.2.0-rc2","22.3.0","22.3.0-rc1","22.4.0","22.4.0-rc1","certified-18.9-cert10","certified-18.9-cert11","certified-18.9-cert12","certified-18.9-cert13","certified-18.9-cert4","certified-18.9-cert5","certified-18.9-cert6","certified-18.9-cert7","certified-18.9-cert8","certified-18.9-cert8-rc1","certified-18.9-cert8-rc2","certified-18.9-cert9","certified/18.9-cert1","certified/18.9-cert1-rc1","certified/18.9-cert2","certified/18.9-cert3","certified/18.9-cert4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-47780.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/security/advisories/GHSA-c7p6-7mvq-8jq2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-78"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
