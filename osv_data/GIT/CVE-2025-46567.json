{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-46567","published":"2025-05-01T17:20:41.020Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:16:31.157479Z","aliases":["GHSA-f2f7-gj54-6vpv"],"summary":"LLaMA-Factory Allows Arbitrary Code Execution via Unsafe Deserialization in Ilamafy_baichuan2.py","details":"LLama Factory enables fine-tuning of large language models. Prior to version 1.0.0, a critical vulnerability exists in the `llamafy_baichuan2.py` script of the LLaMA-Factory project. The script performs insecure deserialization using `torch.load()` on user-supplied `.bin` files from an input directory. An attacker can exploit this behavior by crafting a malicious `.bin` file that executes arbitrary commands during deserialization. This issue has been patched in version 1.0.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/hiyouga/llama-factory","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2989d39239d2f46e584c1e1180ba46b9768afb2a"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-46567.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/46xxx/CVE-2025-46567.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/commit/2989d39239d2f46e584c1e1180ba46b9768afb2a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/security/advisories/GHSA-f2f7-gj54-6vpv"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46567"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/46xxx/CVE-2025-46567.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L"}]}
