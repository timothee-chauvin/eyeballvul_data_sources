{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-21541","published":"2024-11-13T05:15:14Z","modified":"2025-10-21T17:34:23.837318Z","aliases":["GHSA-jrvm-mcxc-mf6m"],"details":"Versions of the package dom-iterator before 1.0.1 are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to use of the Function constructor without complete input sanitization. Function generates a new function body and thus care must be given to ensure that the inputs to Function are not attacker-controlled. The risks involved are similar to that of allowing attacker-controlled input to reach eval.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/matthewmueller/dom-iterator","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9e0e0fad5a251de5b42feb326c4204eb04080805"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2","0.0.3","0.0.4","0.0.5","0.1.0","0.1.1","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.3.0","1.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-21541.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-DOMITERATOR-6157199"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/matthewmueller/dom-iterator/commit/9e0e0fad5a251de5b42feb326c4204eb04080805"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-8383166"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
