Restrict CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to GNU as or LLVM IAS 15.x or newer","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: Restrict CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to GNU as or LLVM IAS 15.x or newer\n\nPrior to LLVM 15.0.0, LLVM's integrated assembler would incorrectly\nbyte-swap NOP when compiling for big-endian, and the resulting series of\nbytes happened to match the encoding of FNMADD S21, S30, S0, S0.\n\nThis went unnoticed until commit:\n\n  34f66c4c4d5518c1 (\"arm64: Use a positive cpucap for FP/SIMD\")\n\nPrior to that commit, the kernel would always enable the use of FPSIMD\nearly in boot when __cpu_setup() initialized CPACR_EL1, and so usage of\nFNMADD within the kernel was not detected, but could result in the\ncorruption of user or kernel FPSIMD state.\n\nAfter that commit, the instructions happen to trap during boot prior to\nFPSIMD being detected and enabled, e.g.\n\n| Unhandled 64-bit el1h sync exception on CPU0, ESR 0x000000001fe00000 -- ASIMD\n| CPU: 0
