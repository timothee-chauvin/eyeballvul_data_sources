In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through runc run (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\"). runc 1.1.12 includes patches for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc","events":[{"introduced":"12644e614e25b05da6fd08a38ffa0cfe1903fdec"},{"fixed":"51d5e94601ceffbbd85688df1c928ecccbfa4685"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc93","v1.0.0-rc94","v1.0.0-rc95","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc.1","v1.1.1","v1.1.10","v1.1.11","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.1.8","v1.1.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-21626.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-xr7r-f8xq-vfvv"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/02120488a4c0fc487d1ed2867e901eeed7ce8ecf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/176993/runc-1.1.11-File-Descriptor-Leak-Privilege-Escalation.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/01/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/02/3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.12"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/02/msg00005.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2NLXNE23Q5ESQUAI22Z7A63JX2WMPJ2J/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SYMO3BANINS6RGFQFKPRG4FIOJ7GWYTL/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/leaky-vessels-part-1-cve-2024-21626"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-403","CWE-668"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
