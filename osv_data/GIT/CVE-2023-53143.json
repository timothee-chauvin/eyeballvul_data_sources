On 1k-block filesystems, block 0 is not part of\nthe filesystem, which means that s_first_data_block is nonzero.\next4_get_group_no_and_offset subtracts this quantity from the blocknr\nargument before cracking it into a group number and a block number\nwithin a group.  IOWs, block group 0 spans blocks 1-8192 (1-based)\ninstead of 0-8191 (0-based) like what happens with larger blocksizes.\n\nThe net result of this encoding is that blocknr < s_first_data_block is\nnot a valid input to this function.  The end_fsb variable is set from\nthe keys that are copied from userspace, which means that in the above\nexample, its value is zero.  That leads to an underflow here:\n\n\tblocknr = blocknr - le32_to_cpu(es->s_first_data_block);\n\nThe division then operates on -1:\n\n\toffset = do_div(blocknr, EXT4_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb))
