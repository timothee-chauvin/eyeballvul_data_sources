This issue was addressed by the  Role-based Access Control https://docs.pinot.apache.org/operators/tutorials/authentication/basic-auth-access-control , so that /appConfigs` and all other APIs can be access controlled. Only authorized users have access to it. Note the user needs to add the admin role accordingly to the RBAC guide to control access to this endpoint, and in the future version of Pinot, a default admin role is planned to be added.\n\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/pinot","events":[{"introduced":"bbf29dc6e0f23383948f0db66565ebbdf383dd0d"},{"fixed":"b6bdf6c9686b286a149d2d1aea4a385ee98f3e79"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-39676.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/23/5"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/hsm0b2w8qr0sqy4rj1mfnnw286tslpzc"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
