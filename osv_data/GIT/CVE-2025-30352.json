{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-30352","published":"2025-03-26T17:18:39Z","modified":"2025-10-30T19:45:28.057339Z","aliases":["GHSA-7wq3-jr35-275c"],"summary":"Directus `search` query parameter allows enumeration of non permitted fields","details":"Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/directus/directus","events":[{"introduced":"807b3e56438e360ce307f6da4200625eed0fb0ef"},{"fixed":"f854746ef0a28c1208d51ab36386e3b353fd721d"}]}],"versions":["10.11.2","v10.0.0","v10.1.0","v10.1.1","v10.10.0","v10.10.1","v10.10.2","v10.10.3","v10.10.4","v10.10.5","v10.10.6","v10.10.7","v10.11.0","v10.11.1","v10.11.2","v10.12.1","v10.13.0","v10.13.1","v10.13.2","v10.2.0","v10.2.1","v10.3.0","v10.4.0","v10.4.2","v10.4.3","v10.5.0","v10.5.1","v10.5.2","v10.5.3","v10.6.0","v10.6.1","v10.6.2","v10.6.3","v10.6.4","v10.7.0","v10.7.1","v10.7.2","v10.8.0","v10.8.1","v10.8.2","v10.8.3","v10.9.0","v10.9.1","v10.9.2","v10.9.3","v11.0.0","v11.0.0-rc.1","v11.0.0-rc.2","v11.0.0-rc.3","v11.0.1","v11.0.2","v11.1.0","v11.1.1","v11.1.2","v11.2.0","v11.2.1","v11.2.2","v11.3.0","v11.3.1","v11.3.2","v11.3.3","v11.3.4","v11.3.5","v11.4.0","v11.4.1","v9.0.0","v9.0.0-alpha.10","v9.0.0-alpha.11","v9.0.0-alpha.12","v9.0.0-alpha.13","v9.0.0-alpha.14","v9.0.0-alpha.15","v9.0.0-alpha.16","v9.0.0-alpha.17","v9.0.0-alpha.18","v9.0.0-alpha.19","v9.0.0-alpha.20","v9.0.0-alpha.21","v9.0.0-alpha.22","v9.0.0-alpha.23","v9.0.0-alpha.24","v9.0.0-alpha.25","v9.0.0-alpha.26","v9.0.0-alpha.27","v9.0.0-alpha.31","v9.0.0-alpha.32","v9.0.0-alpha.33","v9.0.0-alpha.34","v9.0.0-alpha.35","v9.0.0-alpha.36","v9.0.0-alpha.37","v9.0.0-alpha.38","v9.0.0-alpha.39","v9.0.0-alpha.4","v9.0.0-alpha.40","v9.0.0-alpha.41","v9.0.0-alpha.42","v9.0.0-alpha.5","v9.0.0-alpha.6","v9.0.0-alpha.7","v9.0.0-alpha.8","v9.0.0-alpha.9","v9.0.0-beta.0","v9.0.0-beta.1","v9.0.0-beta.10","v9.0.0-beta.11","v9.0.0-beta.12","v9.0.0-beta.13","v9.0.0-beta.14","v9.0.0-beta.2","v9.0.0-beta.3","v9.0.0-beta.4","v9.0.0-beta.5","v9.0.0-beta.7","v9.0.0-beta.8","v9.0.0-beta.9","v9.0.0-rc.0","v9.0.0-rc.1","v9.0.0-rc.10","v9.0.0-rc.100","v9.0.0-rc.101","v9.0.0-rc.11","v9.0.0-rc.12","v9.0.0-rc.13","v9.0.0-rc.14","v9.0.0-rc.15","v9.0.0-rc.17","v9.0.0-rc.18","v9.0.0-rc.19","v9.0.0-rc.2","v9.0.0-rc.20","v9.0.0-rc.21","v9.0.0-rc.22","v9.0.0-rc.23","v9.0.0-rc.24","v9.0.0-rc.25","v9.0.0-rc.26","v9.0.0-rc.27","v9.0.0-rc.28","v9.0.0-rc.29","v9.0.0-rc.3","v9.0.0-rc.30","v9.0.0-rc.31","v9.0.0-rc.32","v9.0.0-rc.33","v9.0.0-rc.34","v9.0.0-rc.35","v9.0.0-rc.36","v9.0.0-rc.37","v9.0.0-rc.38","v9.0.0-rc.39","v9.0.0-rc.4","v9.0.0-rc.40","v9.0.0-rc.41","v9.0.0-rc.42","v9.0.0-rc.43","v9.0.0-rc.44","v9.0.0-rc.45","v9.0.0-rc.46","v9.0.0-rc.47","v9.0.0-rc.48","v9.0.0-rc.49","v9.0.0-rc.5","v9.0.0-rc.50","v9.0.0-rc.51","v9.0.0-rc.52","v9.0.0-rc.53","v9.0.0-rc.54","v9.0.0-rc.55","v9.0.0-rc.56","v9.0.0-rc.57","v9.0.0-rc.58","v9.0.0-rc.59","v9.0.0-rc.6","v9.0.0-rc.60","v9.0.0-rc.61","v9.0.0-rc.62","v9.0.0-rc.63","v9.0.0-rc.64","v9.0.0-rc.65","v9.0.0-rc.66","v9.0.0-rc.67","v9.0.0-rc.68","v9.0.0-rc.69","v9.0.0-rc.7","v9.0.0-rc.70","v9.0.0-rc.71","v9.0.0-rc.72","v9.0.0-rc.73","v9.0.0-rc.74","v9.0.0-rc.75","v9.0.0-rc.76","v9.0.0-rc.77","v9.0.0-rc.78","v9.0.0-rc.79","v9.0.0-rc.8","v9.0.0-rc.80","v9.0.0-rc.81","v9.0.0-rc.82","v9.0.0-rc.83","v9.0.0-rc.84","v9.0.0-rc.85","v9.0.0-rc.86","v9.0.0-rc.87","v9.0.0-rc.88","v9.0.0-rc.89","v9.0.0-rc.9","v9.0.0-rc.90","v9.0.0-rc.91","v9.0.0-rc.92","v9.0.0-rc.93","v9.0.0-rc.94","v9.0.0-rc.95","v9.0.0-rc.96","v9.0.0-rc.97","v9.0.0-rc.98","v9.0.0-rc.99","v9.0.0-y.0","v9.0.1","v9.1.0","v9.1.1","v9.1.2","v9.10.0","v9.11.0","v9.11.1","v9.12.0","v9.12.1","v9.12.2","v9.13.0","v9.14.1","v9.14.2","v9.14.3","v9.14.4","v9.14.5","v9.15.0","v9.15.1","v9.16.0","v9.16.1","v9.17.0","v9.17.1","v9.17.2","v9.17.3","v9.17.4","v9.18.0","v9.18.1","v9.19.0","v9.19.1","v9.19.2","v9.2.0","v9.2.1","v9.2.2","v9.20.0","v9.20.1","v9.20.2","v9.20.3","v9.20.4","v9.21.0","v9.21.1","v9.21.2","v9.22.0","v9.22.1","v9.22.2","v9.22.3","v9.22.4","v9.23.0","v9.23.1","v9.23.2","v9.23.3","v9.23.4","v9.24.0","v9.25.0","v9.25.1","v9.25.2","v9.26.0","v9.3.0","v9.4.0","v9.4.1","v9.4.2","v9.4.3","v9.5.0","v9.5.1","v9.5.2","v9.6.0","v9.7.0","v9.7.1","v9.8.0","v9.9.0","v9.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-30352.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-7wq3-jr35-275c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/ac5a9964d9926f20dc063a74cb417dc7bbad676d"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
