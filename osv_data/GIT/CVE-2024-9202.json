{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-9202","published":"2024-09-27T10:15:02Z","modified":"2025-10-22T07:52:51.169818Z","details":"In Eclipse Dataspace Components versions 0.1.3 to 0.9.0, the Connector component filters which datasets (= data offers) another party can see in a requested catalog, to ensure that only authorized parties are able to view restricted offers.\nHowever, there is the possibility to request a single dataset, which should be subject to the same filtering process, but currently is missing the correct filtering.\n\n\nThis enables parties to potentially see datasets they should not have access to, thereby exposing sensitive information. Exploiting this vulnerability requires knowing the ID of a restricted dataset, but some IDs may be guessed by trying out many IDs in an automated way.\n\n\nAffected code:\n DatasetResolverImpl, L76-79 https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/blob/v0.9.0/core/control-plane/control-plane-catalog/src/main/java/org/eclipse/edc/connector/controlplane/catalog/DatasetResolverImpl.java","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/eclipse-edc/connector","events":[{"introduced":"d518ff58cc009d75ce8b73aba2a65688a91cdde5"},{"fixed":"1bd6e683e6304f7e34e0d161cd750424dc2d4dae"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.3","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-9202.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/cve-assignement/-/issues/35"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/pull/4490"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/pull/4491"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
