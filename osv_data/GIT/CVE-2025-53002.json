A remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in LLaMA-Factory versions up to and including 0.9.3 during the LLaMA-Factory training process. This vulnerability arises because the `vhead_file` is loaded without proper safeguards, allowing malicious attackers to execute arbitrary malicious code on the host system simply by passing a malicious `Checkpoint path` parameter through the `WebUI` interface. The attack is stealthy, as the victim remains unaware of the exploitation. The root cause is that the `vhead_file` argument is loaded without the secure parameter `weights_only=True`. Version 0.9.4 contains a fix for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/hiyouga/llama-factory","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"95ac3f2373b82662c1bd855c284d3379e6a763d3"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.9","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.3.0","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53002.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/hiyouga/llamafactory","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bb7bf51554d4ba8432333c35a5e3b52705955ede"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53002.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AddKm2mllsXfuvL4Tvbn_WJdjEOYXx4y/view?usp=sharing"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/53xxx/CVE-2025-53002.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/commit/bb7bf51554d4ba8432333c35a5e3b52705955ede"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/security/advisories/GHSA-xj56-p8mm-qmxj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53002"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-502","CWE-94"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/53xxx/CVE-2025-53002.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H"}]}
