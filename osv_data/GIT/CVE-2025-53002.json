{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-53002","published":"2025-06-26T14:40:52Z","modified":"2025-10-21T19:33:41Z","aliases":["GHSA-xj56-p8mm-qmxj"],"summary":"LLaMA-Factory Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability","details":"LLaMA-Factory is a tuning library for large language models. A remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in LLaMA-Factory versions up to and including 0.9.3 during the LLaMA-Factory training process. This vulnerability arises because the `vhead_file` is loaded without proper safeguards, allowing malicious attackers to execute arbitrary malicious code on the host system simply by passing a malicious `Checkpoint path` parameter through the `WebUI` interface. The attack is stealthy, as the victim remains unaware of the exploitation. The root cause is that the `vhead_file` argument is loaded without the secure parameter `weights_only=True`. Version 0.9.4 contains a fix for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/hiyouga/llama-factory","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bb7bf51554d4ba8432333c35a5e3b52705955ede"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53002.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/security/advisories/GHSA-xj56-p8mm-qmxj"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/commit/bb7bf51554d4ba8432333c35a5e3b52705955ede"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AddKm2mllsXfuvL4Tvbn_WJdjEOYXx4y/view?usp=sharing"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502","CWE-94"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H"}]}
