A p2c parameter set too high in JWE's algorithm PBES2-* could lead to a denial of service. The JWE key management algorithms based on PBKDF2 require a JOSE Header Parameter called p2c (PBES2 Count). This parameter dictates the number of PBKDF2 iterations needed to derive a CEK wrapping key. Its primary purpose is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function, making password brute-force and dictionary attacks more resource- intensive. Therefore, if an attacker sets the p2c parameter in JWE to a very large number, it can cause a lot of computational consumption, resulting in a denial of service. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `64f2a229b` which has been included in release version 1.2.27 and 2.0.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"611567baacc0ef42263708892a08533812324a14"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx","events":[{"introduced":"8f97f606570bc3de90005ce3188824e7e7eff88a"},{"fixed":"e75b7c8dcbf8e56ecfbeb17b8b3ffaa81a96914f"}]}],"versions":["v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.5-rc1","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.1.7-rc1","v1.1.8-rc1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.10","v1.2.11","v1.2.12","v1.2.13","v1.2.14","v1.2.15","v1.2.17","v1.2.18","v1.2.19","v1.2.2","v1.2.20","v1.2.21","v1.2.22","v1.2.23","v1.2.24","v1.2.25","v1.2.26","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.2.9","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.10","v2.0.11","v2.0.12","v2.0.14","v2.0.15","v2.0.16","v2.0.17","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-49290.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/security/advisories/GHSA-7f9x-gw85-8grf"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/commit/64f2a229b8e18605f47361d292b526bdc4aee01c"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
