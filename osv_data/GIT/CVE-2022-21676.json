{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-21676","published":"2022-01-12T18:25:15Z","modified":"2025-11-04T19:54:09.129484Z","aliases":["GHSA-273r-mgr4-v34f"],"summary":"Uncaught Exception in engine.io","details":"Engine.IO is the implementation of transport-based cross-browser/cross-device bi-directional communication layer for Socket.IO. A specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This impacts all the users of the `engine.io` package starting from version `4.0.0`, including those who uses depending packages like `socket.io`. Versions prior to `4.0.0` are not impacted. A fix has been released for each major branch, namely `4.1.2` for the `4.x.x` branch, `5.2.1` for the `5.x.x` branch, and `6.1.1` for the `6.x.x` branch. There is no known workaround except upgrading to a safe version.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/socketio/engine.io","events":[{"introduced":"70b1c36be112671b690736de1a24753e8ec5ba22"},{"fixed":"c6315af44826b87f6802574f1ef79dfa63777fab"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"4.0.0"},{"fixed":"4.1.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/socketio/engine.io","events":[{"introduced":"887ba06536a1fe0cd34e8b36cd31235e4f90b31d"},{"fixed":"d36199cfe03caac96f5e84326561e9ccd460df1e"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"5.0.0"},{"fixed":"5.2.1"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/socketio/engine.io","events":[{"introduced":"fe5d97fc3d7a26d34bce786a97962fae3d7ce17f"},{"fixed":"f3b761dc560e6cd045ef42939dc28d7138f245e9"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.1"}]}}],"versions":["4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.0.4","4.0.5","4.0.6","4.1.0","4.1.1","5.0.0","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.2.0","6.0.0","6.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-21676.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/66f889fc1d966bf5bfa0de1939069153643874ab"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/a70800d7e96da32f6e6622804ef659ebc58659db"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/c0e194d44933bd83bf9a4b126fca68ba7bf5098c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/releases/tag/4.1.2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/releases/tag/5.2.1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/releases/tag/6.1.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/security/advisories/GHSA-273r-mgr4-v34f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220209-0002/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-754"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
