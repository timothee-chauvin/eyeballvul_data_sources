Starting in version 1.1.0 and prior to version 1.5.19, Symfony 1 has a gadget chain due to dangerous deserialization in `sfNamespacedParameterHolder` class that would enable an attacker to get remote code execution if a developer deserializes user input in their project. Version 1.5.19 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/friendsofsymfony1/symfony1","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0bd9d59c69221f49bfc8be8b871b79e12d7d171a"}]}],"versions":["v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.10","v1.5.11","v1.5.12","v1.5.13","v1.5.14","v1.5.15","v1.5.16","v1.5.17","v1.5.18","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.5.6","v1.5.7","v1.5.8","v1.5.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-28861.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/28xxx/CVE-2024-28861.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony1/symfony1/commit/0bd9d59c69221f49bfc8be8b871b79e12d7d171a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony1/symfony1/security/advisories/GHSA-pv9j-c53q-h433"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28861"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/28xxx/CVE-2024-28861.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
