Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 are vulnerable to a bypass in the plugin signature verification. An attacker can convince a server admin to download and successfully run a malicious plugin even though unsigned plugins are not allowed. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not install plugins downloaded from untrusted sources.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5bc88988a5a25c23452249315e8789ef059a2a3d"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana","events":[{"introduced":"b5c56f63710e09f37b8557ddd8b99ae3fc583169"},{"fixed":"3c0c14de5d73bed5cc429d2beeabd0217c6bf221"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31123.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-rhxj-gh46-jvw8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221124-0002/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/releases/tag/v9.1.8"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-347"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
