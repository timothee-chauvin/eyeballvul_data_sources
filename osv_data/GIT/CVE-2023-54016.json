In ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup(), during\ndescriptor cleanup rx_descs and tx_descs memory is not freed.\n\nThis is cause of memory leak. These allocated memory should be\nfreed in ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup.\n\nIn ath12k_dp_cc_desc_init(), we can save base address of rx_descs\nand tx_descs. In ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup(), we can free rx_descs and\ntx_descs memory using their base address.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.0.1-00029-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d889913205cf7ebda905b1e62c5867ed4e39f6c2"},{"fixed":"e16be2d34883eecfe7fd888fcdb76c7a5db5d187"},{"fixed":"afb522b36e76acaa9f8fc06d0a9742d841c47c16"}]}],"versions":["v6.1","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.5.1","v6.5.2","v6.5.3","v6.5.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54016.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.3.0"},{"fixed":"6.5.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54016.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/afb522b36e76acaa9f8fc06d0a9742d841c47c16"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e16be2d34883eecfe7fd888fcdb76c7a5db5d187"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54016.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54016"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54016.json"}}
