This may allow an attacker to brute force the application's session keys.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mojolicious/mojo","events":[{"introduced":"466b3bb90fbd055410771ea09f0506b2f26faf2f"},{"last_affected":"1a87f721d24a4542ac7828753696e9462f790ab6"}]}],"versions":["v7.28","v7.29","v7.30","v7.31","v7.32","v7.33","v7.34","v7.35","v7.36","v7.37","v7.38","v7.39","v7.40","v7.41","v7.42","v7.43","v7.44","v7.45","v7.46","v7.47","v7.48","v7.49","v7.50","v7.51","v7.52","v7.53","v7.54","v7.55","v7.56","v7.57","v7.58","v7.59","v7.60","v7.61","v7.62","v7.63","v7.64","v7.65","v7.66","v7.67","v7.68","v7.69","v7.70","v7.71","v7.72","v7.73","v7.74","v7.75","v7.76","v7.77","v7.78","v7.79","v7.80","v7.81","v7.82","v7.83","v7.84","v7.85","v7.86","v7.87","v7.88","v7.89","v7.90","v7.91","v7.92","v7.93","v7.94","v8.0","v8.01","v8.02","v8.03","v8.04","v8.05","v8.06","v8.07","v8.08","v8.09","v8.10","v8.11","v8.12","v8.13","v8.14","v8.15","v8.16","v8.17","v8.18","v8.19","v8.20","v8.21","v8.22","v8.23","v8.24","v8.25","v8.26","v8.27","v8.28","v8.29","v8.30","v8.31","v8.32","v8.33","v8.34","v8.35","v8.36","v8.37","v8.38","v8.39","v8.40","v8.41","v8.42","v8.50","v8.51","v8.52","v8.53","v8.54","v8.55","v8.56","v8.57","v8.58","v8.59","v8.60","v8.61","v8.62","v8.63","v8.64","v8.65","v8.66","v8.67","v8.68","v8.69","v8.70","v8.71","v8.72","v8.73","v9.0","v9.01","v9.02","v9.03","v9.07","v9.08","v9.09","v9.10","v9.11","v9.12","v9.13","v9.14","v9.15","v9.16","v9.17","v9.18","v9.19","v9.20","v9.21","v9.22","v9.23","v9.24","v9.25","v9.26","v9.27","v9.28","v9.29","v9.30","v9.31","v9.32","v9.33","v9.34","v9.35","v9.36","v9.37","v9.38","v9.39","v9.40"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-58135.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-perl/2025/05/msg00016.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-perl/2025/05/msg00017.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-perl/2025/05/msg00018.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://metacpan.org/release/SRI/Mojolicious-7.28/source/lib/Mojolicious/Command/generate/app.pm#L220"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://metacpan.org/release/SRI/Mojolicious-9.38/source/lib/Mojolicious/Command/Author/generate/app.pm#L202"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://metacpan.org/release/SRI/Mojolicious-9.39/source/lib/Mojo/Util.pm#L181"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/rand"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/pull/4090"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/mojolicious/mojo/pull/2200"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://security.metacpan.org/docs/guides/random-data-for-security.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
