{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-40003","published":"2025-10-18T08:03:23.529Z","modified":"2025-11-20T10:20:38.531434Z","summary":"net: mscc: ocelot: Fix use-after-free caused by cyclic delayed work","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: mscc: ocelot: Fix use-after-free caused by cyclic delayed work\n\nThe origin code calls cancel_delayed_work() in ocelot_stats_deinit()\nto cancel the cyclic delayed work item ocelot->stats_work. However,\ncancel_delayed_work() may fail to cancel the work item if it is already\nexecuting. While destroy_workqueue() does wait for all pending work items\nin the work queue to complete before destroying the work queue, it cannot\nprevent the delayed work item from being rescheduled within the\nocelot_check_stats_work() function. This limitation exists because the\ndelayed work item is only enqueued into the work queue after its timer\nexpires. Before the timer expiration, destroy_workqueue() has no visibility\nof this pending work item. Once the work queue appears empty,\ndestroy_workqueue() proceeds with destruction. When the timer eventually\nexpires, the delayed work item gets queued again, leading to the following\nwarning:\n\nworkqueue: cannot queue ocelot_check_stats_work on wq ocelot-switch-stats\nWARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 0 at kernel/workqueue.c:2255 __queue_work+0x875/0xaf0\n...\nRIP: 0010:__queue_work+0x875/0xaf0\n...\nRSP: 0018:ffff88806d108b10 EFLAGS: 00010086\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000101 RCX: 0000000000000027\nRDX: 0000000000000027 RSI: 0000000000000004 RDI: ffff88806d123e88\nRBP: ffffffff813c3170 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffed100da247d2\nR10: ffffed100da247d1 R11: ffff88806d123e8b R12: ffff88800c00f000\nR13: ffff88800d7285c0 R14: ffff88806d0a5580 R15: ffff88800d7285a0\nFS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8880e5725000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 00007fe18e45ea10 CR3: 0000000005e6c000 CR4: 00000000000006f0\nCall Trace:\n <IRQ>\n ? kasan_report+0xc6/0xf0\n ? __pfx_delayed_work_timer_fn+0x10/0x10\n ? __pfx_delayed_work_timer_fn+0x10/0x10\n call_timer_fn+0x25/0x1c0\n __run_timer_base.part.0+0x3be/0x8c0\n ? __pfx_delayed_work_timer_fn+0x10/0x10\n ? rcu_sched_clock_irq+0xb06/0x27d0\n ? __pfx___run_timer_base.part.0+0x10/0x10\n ? try_to_wake_up+0xb15/0x1960\n ? _raw_spin_lock_irq+0x80/0xe0\n ? __pfx__raw_spin_lock_irq+0x10/0x10\n tmigr_handle_remote_up+0x603/0x7e0\n ? __pfx_tmigr_handle_remote_up+0x10/0x10\n ? sched_balance_trigger+0x1c0/0x9f0\n ? sched_tick+0x221/0x5a0\n ? _raw_spin_lock_irq+0x80/0xe0\n ? __pfx__raw_spin_lock_irq+0x10/0x10\n ? tick_nohz_handler+0x339/0x440\n ? __pfx_tmigr_handle_remote_up+0x10/0x10\n __walk_groups.isra.0+0x42/0x150\n tmigr_handle_remote+0x1f4/0x2e0\n ? __pfx_tmigr_handle_remote+0x10/0x10\n ? ktime_get+0x60/0x140\n ? lapic_next_event+0x11/0x20\n ? clockevents_program_event+0x1d4/0x2a0\n ? hrtimer_interrupt+0x322/0x780\n handle_softirqs+0x16a/0x550\n irq_exit_rcu+0xaf/0xe0\n sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x70/0x80\n </IRQ>\n...\n\nThe following diagram reveals the cause of the above warning:\n\nCPU 0 (remove)             | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)\nmscc_ocelot_remove()       |\n  ocelot_deinit()          | ocelot_check_stats_work()\n    ocelot_stats_deinit()  |\n      cancel_delayed_work()|   ...\n                           |   queue_delayed_work()\n      destroy_workqueue()  | (wait a time)\n                           | __queue_work() //UAF\n\nThe above scenario actually constitutes a UAF vulnerability.\n\nThe ocelot_stats_deinit() is only invoked when initialization\nfailure or resource destruction, so we must ensure that any\ndelayed work items cannot be rescheduled.\n\nReplace cancel_delayed_work() with disable_delayed_work_sync()\nto guarantee proper cancellation of the delayed work item and\nensure completion of any currently executing work before the\nworkqueue is deallocated.\n\nA deadlock concern was considered: ocelot_stats_deinit() is called\nin a process context and is not holding any locks that the delayed\nwork item might also need. Therefore, the use of the _sync() variant\nis safe here.\n\nThis bug was identified through static analysis.
