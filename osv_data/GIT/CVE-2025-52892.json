{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-52892","published":"2025-08-05T00:17:16.047Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:38:00.447465Z","aliases":["GHSA-26x2-6wch-j8pf"],"summary":"EspoCRM is vulnerable to access denial through double slash in URI corrupting router cache","details":"EspoCRM is a web application with a frontend designed as a single-page application and a REST API backend written in PHP. In versions 9.1.6 and below, if a user loads Espo in the browser with double slashes (e.g https://domain//#Admin) and the webserver does not strip the double slash, it can cause a corrupted Slim router's cache. This will make the instance unusable until there is a completed rebuild. This is fixed in version 9.1.7.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/espocrm/espocrm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4baab4dff4342ed1b194015407c8bc74b4cc9a7d"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.2.0","1.2.1","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.1.0","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.6.0","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.7.2","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.9.0","2.9.1","2.9.2","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.3.0","3.4.0","3.4.1","3.4.2","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.5.2","3.6.0","3.6.1","3.6.2","3.7.0","3.7.1","3.7.2","3.7.3","3.7.4","3.8.0","3.9.0","3.9.1","3.9.2","4.0.0","4.0.0-beta.1","4.0.0-beta.2","4.0.0-beta.3","4.0.0-beta.4","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.0.4","4.0.5","4.0.6","4.1.0","4.1.1","4.1.2","4.1.3","4.1.4","4.1.5","4.1.6","4.2.0","4.2.1","4.2.2","4.2.3","4.2.4","4.2.5","4.2.6","4.2.7","4.3.0","4.3.0-beta.1","4.3.0-beta.2","4.3.1","4.4.0","4.4.1","4.5.0","4.5.1","4.6.0","4.7.0","4.7.1","4.7.2","4.8.0","4.8.1","4.8.2","4.8.3","4.8.4","5.0.0","5.0.1","5.0.2","5.0.3","5.0.4","5.0.5","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.1.2","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.2.2","5.2.3","5.2.4","5.2.5","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.3.4","5.3.5","5.3.6","5.4.0","5.4.1","5.4.2","5.4.3","5.4.4","5.4.5","5.5.0","5.5.1","5.5.2","5.5.3","5.5.4","5.5.5","5.5.6","5.6.0","5.6.1","5.6.10","5.6.11","5.6.12","5.6.13","5.6.14","5.6.2","5.6.3","5.6.4","5.6.5","5.6.6","5.6.7","5.6.8","5.6.9","5.7.0","5.7.1","5.7.10","5.7.11","5.7.2","5.7.3","5.7.4","5.7.5","5.7.6","5.7.7","5.7.8","5.7.9","5.8.0","5.8.1","5.8.2","5.8.3","5.8.4","5.8.5","5.9.0","5.9.1","5.9.2","5.9.3","5.9.4","6.0.0","6.0.0-beta1","6.0.0-beta2","6.0.0-beta3","6.0.0-beta4","6.0.1","6.0.10","6.0.2","6.0.3","6.0.4","6.0.5","6.0.6","6.0.7","6.0.8","6.0.9","6.1.0","6.1.1","6.1.10","6.1.2","6.1.3","6.1.4","6.1.5","6.1.6","6.1.7","6.1.8","6.1.9","7.0.0","7.0.1","7.0.10","7.0.2","7.0.3","7.0.4","7.0.5","7.0.6","7.0.7","7.0.8","7.0.9","7.1.0","7.1.1","7.1.10","7.1.11","7.1.2","7.1.3","7.1.4","7.1.5","7.1.6","7.1.7","7.1.8","7.1.9","7.2.0","7.2.1","7.2.2","7.2.3","7.2.4","7.2.5","7.2.6","7.2.7","7.3.0","7.3.1","7.3.2","7.3.3","7.3.4","7.4.0","7.4.1","7.4.2","7.4.3","7.4.4","7.4.5","7.4.6","7.5.0","7.5.1","7.5.2","7.5.3","7.5.4","7.5.5","7.5.6","8.0.0","8.0.1","8.0.2","8.0.3","8.0.4","8.0.5","8.0.6","8.1.0","8.1.1","8.1.2","8.1.3","8.1.4","8.1.5","8.2.0","8.2.1","8.2.2","8.2.3","8.2.4","8.2.5","8.3.0","8.3.1","8.3.2","8.3.3","8.3.4","8.3.5","8.3.6","8.4.0","8.4.1","8.4.2","9.0.0","9.0.1","9.0.2","9.0.3","9.0.4","9.0.5","9.0.6","9.0.7","9.0.8","9.1.0","9.1.1","9.1.2","9.1.3","9.1.4","9.1.5","9.1.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52892.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/espocrm/espocrm/commit/929611f317ce8892ea75873b0ab3094c0c510ff3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/espocrm/espocrm/security/advisories/GHSA-26x2-6wch-j8pf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-444"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
