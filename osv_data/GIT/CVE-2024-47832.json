Affected versions are vulnerable to XML signature bypass attacks. An attacker can carry out signature bypass if you have access to certain IDP-signed messages. The underlying mechanism exploits differential behavior between XML parsers. Users of https://ssoready.com, the public hosted instance of SSOReady, are unaffected. We advise folks who self-host SSOReady to upgrade to 7f92a06 or later. Do so by updating your SSOReady Docker images from sha-... to sha-7f92a06. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7f92a0630439972fcbefa8c7eafe8c144bd89915"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47832.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready/security/advisories/GHSA-j2hr-q93x-gxvh"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready/commit/7f92a0630439972fcbefa8c7eafe8c144bd89915"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://ssoready.com/docs/self-hosting/self-hosting-sso-ready"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-347"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
