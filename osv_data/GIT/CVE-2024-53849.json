In affected versions several overflows may occur in switch case '[' when the input pattern contains many escaped characters.

There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"fd8cf1e94ecf4e6e4493833f96140cf9bd17578e"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.11.3","v0.11.4","v0.11.5","v0.12.0","v0.12.0-alpha1","v0.12.0-beta","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.12.3","v0.12.4","v0.12.5","v0.12.6","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v0.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-53849.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://editorconfig.org"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c/commit/4d5518a0a4e4910c37281ab13a048d0d86999782"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c/commit/a8dd5312e08abeab95ff5656d32ed3cb85fba70b"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c/pull/103"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c/security/advisories/GHSA-475j-wc37-6274"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00036.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-121"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
