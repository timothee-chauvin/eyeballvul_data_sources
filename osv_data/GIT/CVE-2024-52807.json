{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-52807","published":"2025-01-24T18:34:23.255Z","modified":"2025-12-05T07:20:22.554292Z","aliases":["GHSA-8c3x-hq82-gjcm"],"summary":"XXE vulnerability in XSLT parsing in `org.hl7.fhir.publisher`","details":"The HL7 FHIR IG publisher is a tool to take a set of inputs and create a standard FHIR IG. Prior to version 1.7.4, XSLT transforms performed by various components are vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag `( ]>` could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where org.hl7.fhir.publisher is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. A previous release provided an incomplete solution revealed by new testing. This issue has been patched as of version 1.7.4. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/hl7/fhir-ig-publisher","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9a619c4c6cebb3cb3566f079c8f4324dbd05cb90"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.4"}]}}],"versions":["1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.10","1.1.100","1.1.101","1.1.102","1.1.103","1.1.104","1.1.105","1.1.106","1.1.107","1.1.108","1.1.109","1.1.11","1.1.110","1.1.111","1.1.112","1.1.113","1.1.114","1.1.115","1.1.116","1.1.117","1.1.118","1.1.119","1.1.12","1.1.120","1.1.121","1.1.122","1.1.123","1.1.124","1.1.125","1.1.126","1.1.127","1.1.128","1.1.129","1.1.13","1.1.130","1.1.131","1.1.14","1.1.15","1.1.16","1.1.17","1.1.18","1.1.19","1.1.2","1.1.20","1.1.21","1.1.22","1.1.23","1.1.24","1.1.25","1.1.26","1.1.27","1.1.3","1.1.32","1.1.33","1.1.34","1.1.35","1.1.37","1.1.38","1.1.39","1.1.4","1.1.40","1.1.41","1.1.42","1.1.43","1.1.44","1.1.45","1.1.47","1.1.48","1.1.5","1.1.50","1.1.51","1.1.53","1.1.54","1.1.55","1.1.56","1.1.57","1.1.58","1.1.59","1.1.6","1.1.60","1.1.61","1.1.62","1.1.63","1.1.64","1.1.65","1.1.66","1.1.67","1.1.68","1.1.7","1.1.71","1.1.72","1.1.73","1.1.74","1.1.75","1.1.76","1.1.77","1.1.78","1.1.79","1.1.8","1.1.80","1.1.81","1.1.82","1.1.83","1.1.84","1.1.85","1.1.86","1.1.87","1.1.88","1.1.89","1.1.9","1.1.90","1.1.91","1.1.92","1.1.93","1.1.94","1.1.95","1.1.96","1.1.97","1.1.98","1.1.99","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.10","1.2.11","1.2.12","1.2.13","1.2.14","1.2.15","1.2.17","1.2.18","1.2.19","1.2.2","1.2.20","1.2.21","1.2.22","1.2.23","1.2.24","1.2.25","1.2.26","1.2.27","1.2.28","1.2.29","1.2.3","1.2.30","1.2.31","1.2.32","1.2.33","1.2.34","1.2.35","1.2.36","1.2.37","1.2.38","1.2.39","1.2.4","1.2.40","1.2.41","1.2.42","1.2.43","1.2.44","1.2.45","1.2.46","1.2.47","1.2.48","1.2.49","1.2.5","1.2.50","1.2.51","1.2.52","1.2.53","1.2.54","1.2.6","1.2.7","1.2.8","1.2.9","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.10","1.3.11","1.3.12","1.3.13","1.3.14","1.3.15","1.3.16","1.3.17","1.3.18","1.3.19","1.3.2","1.3.20","1.3.21","1.3.22","1.3.23","1.3.24","1.3.25","1.3.26","1.3.27","1.3.28","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.5","1.3.6","1.3.7","1.3.8","1.3.9","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.10","1.4.11","1.4.12","1.4.13","1.4.14","1.4.15","1.4.16","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.4.8","1.4.9","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.5.10","1.5.11","1.5.12","1.5.13","1.5.14","1.5.15","1.5.16","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.4","1.5.5","1.5.6","1.5.8","1.5.9","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.10","1.6.11","1.6.12","1.6.13","1.6.14","1.6.15","1.6.16","1.6.17","1.6.18","1.6.19","1.6.2","1.6.20","1.6.21","1.6.22","1.6.23","1.6.24","1.6.25","1.6.26","1.6.27","1.6.28","1.6.29","1.6.3","1.6.30","1.6.31","1.6.4","1.6.5","1.6.6","1.6.7","1.6.8","1.6.9","1.7.0","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.7.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-52807.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/52xxx/CVE-2024-52807.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/compare/1.7.3...1.7.4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/security/advisories/GHSA-8c3x-hq82-gjcm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52807"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-611"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/52xxx/CVE-2024-52807.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
