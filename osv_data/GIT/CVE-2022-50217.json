{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-50217","published":"2025-06-18T11:03:53.451Z","modified":"2025-12-04T20:29:34.559720Z","summary":"fuse: write inode in fuse_release()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfuse: write inode in fuse_release()\n\nA race between write(2) and close(2) allows pages to be dirtied after\nfuse_flush -> write_inode_now().  If these pages are not flushed from\nfuse_release(), then there might not be a writable open file later.  So any\nremaining dirty pages must be written back before the file is released.\n\nThis is a partial revert of the blamed commit.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"36ea23374d1f7b6a9d96a2b61d38830fdf23e45d"},{"fixed":"5ccb0420b7c9334ab8122037847101931b899301"},{"fixed":"4bd9d5d20f344d015422969302d12653c903c271"},{"fixed":"035ff33cf4db101250fb980a3941bf078f37a544"}]}],"versions":["v5.15","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.18.1","v5.18.10","v5.18.11","v5.18.12","v5.18.13","v5.18.14","v5.18.15","v5.18.16","v5.18.17","v5.18.2","v5.18.3","v5.18.4","v5.18.5","v5.18.6","v5.18.7","v5.18.8","v5.18.9","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.19.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50217.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.18.18"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.19.0"},{"fixed":"5.19.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50217.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/035ff33cf4db101250fb980a3941bf078f37a544"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4bd9d5d20f344d015422969302d12653c903c271"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5ccb0420b7c9334ab8122037847101931b899301"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50217.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50217"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50217.json"}}
