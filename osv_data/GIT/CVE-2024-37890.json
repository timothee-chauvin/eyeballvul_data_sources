A request with a number of headers exceeding theserver.maxHeadersCount threshold could be used to crash a ws server. The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (e55e510) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (22c2876), ws@6.2.3 (eeb76d3), and ws@5.2.4 (4abd8f6). In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways: 1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the --max-http-header-size=size and/or the maxHeaderSize options so that no more headers than the server.maxHeadersCount limit can be sent. 2. Set server.maxHeadersCount to 0 so that no limit is applied.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/websockets/ws","events":[{"introduced":"5bccfe59252923b85e7cffd56e3ddc1bd742f378"},{"fixed":"aa8fe0a93f65a5aad9e9724d14c09950682c46c4"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.1.0"},{"fixed":"5.2.4"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/websockets/ws","events":[{"introduced":"1ee42fd67d365409096c11af0d6bc70fbe292c60"},{"fixed":"d87f3b6d3a00513af9bbb74f45ba9183af4e5f43"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/websockets/ws","events":[{"introduced":"092a822a41eb22f6d6745c18bc29b9c40715680f"},{"fixed":"d962d70649e393841ee1ed726a8f7ffbe90d0c06"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"7.0.0"},{"fixed":"7.5.10"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/websockets/ws","events":[{"introduced":"fc4024898c0da9b587c50a4a2d02d3ff88cddf06"},{"fixed":"3c56601092872f7d7566989f0e379271afd0e4a1"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"8.0.0"},{"fixed":"8.17.1"}]}}],"versions":["2.1.0","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.3.0","2.3.1","3.0.0","3.1.0","3.2.0","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.3.2","3.3.3","4.0.0","4.1.0","5.0.0","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.2.2","5.2.3","6.0.0","6.1.0","6.1.1","6.1.2","6.1.3","6.1.4","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.2.2","7.0.0","7.0.1","7.1.0","7.1.1","7.1.2","7.2.0","7.2.1","7.2.2","7.2.3","7.2.4","7.2.5","7.3.0","7.3.1","7.4.0","7.4.1","7.4.2","7.4.3","7.4.4","7.4.5","7.4.6","7.5.0","7.5.1","7.5.2","7.5.3","7.5.4","7.5.5","7.5.6","7.5.7","7.5.8","7.5.9","8.0.0","8.1.0","8.10.0","8.11.0","8.12.0","8.12.1","8.13.0","8.14.0","8.14.1","8.14.2","8.15.0","8.15.1","8.16.0","8.17.0","8.2.0","8.2.1","8.2.2","8.2.3","8.3.0","8.4.0","8.4.1","8.4.2","8.5.0","8.6.0","8.7.0","8.8.0","8.8.1","8.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-37890.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/websockets/ws/security/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
