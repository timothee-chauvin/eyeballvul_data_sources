  "details": "libcurl wrongly allows HTTP cookies to be set for Top Level Domains (TLDs) if\nthe hostname is provided with a trailing dot.\n\ncurl can be told to receive and send cookies when communicating using\nHTTP(S). curl's \"cookie engine\" can be built with or without [Public Suffix\nList](https://publicsuffix.org/) awareness. If PSL support not provided, a\nmore rudimentary check exists to at least prevent cookies from being set on\nTLDs. This check was broken if the hostname in the URL uses a trailing dot.\n\nThis can allow arbitrary sites to set cookies that then would get sent to a\ndifferent and unrelated site or domain.",
