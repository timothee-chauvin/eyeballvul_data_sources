[0]\n\nIf SMC creates a kernel socket in __smc_create(), the kernel\nsocket is supposed to be freed in smc_clcsock_release() by\ncalling sock_release() when we close() the parent SMC socket.\n\nHowever, at the end of smc_clcsock_release(), the kernel\nsocket's sk_state might not be TCP_CLOSE.  This means that\nwe have not called inet_csk_destroy_sock() in __tcp_close()\nand have not stopped the TCP timers.\n\nThe kernel socket's TCP timers can be fired later, so we\nneed to hold a refcnt for net as we do for MPTCP subflows\nin mptcp_subflow_create_socket().\n\n[0]:\nleaked reference.\n sk_alloc (./include/net/net_namespace.h:335 net/core/sock.c:2108)\n inet_create
