When two OpenSSL::X509::Name objects are compared using ==, depending on the ordering, non-equal objects may return true. When the first argument is one character longer than the second, or the second argument contains a character that is one less than a character in the same position of the first argument, the result of == will be true. This could be leveraged to create an illegitimate certificate that may be accepted as legitimate and then used in signing or encryption operations.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ruby/openssl","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"08e12dd9302c1fd517c642bdd7d274e64b354c53"}]}],"versions":["v2.0.0","v2.0.0.beta.1","v2.0.0.beta.2","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.0.9","v2.1.0","v2.1.0.beta1","v2.1.0.beta2","v2.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-16395.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ruby/ruby","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"faba7187c5e659d7a6da67ec844c4989fc74a8d5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-16395.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/10/17/openssl-x509-name-equality-check-does-not-work-correctly-cve-2018-16395/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-07/msg00036.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1042105"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3729"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3730"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3731"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3738"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1948"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2565"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/387250"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/10/msg00020.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190221-0002/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3808-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4332"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/10/17/ruby-2-3-8-released/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/10/17/ruby-2-4-5-released/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/10/17/ruby-2-5-2-released/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/11/06/ruby-2-6-0-preview3-released/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
