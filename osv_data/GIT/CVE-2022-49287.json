tpm_common_write() although the reference counter is already zero.\n\nSince commit 8979b02aaf1d (\"tpm: Fix reference count to main device\") the\nextra reference used to prevent a premature zero counter is never taken,\nbecause the required TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 flag is never set.\n\nFix this by moving the TPM 2 character device handling from\ntpm_chip_alloc() to tpm_add_char_device() which is called at a later point\nin time when the flag has been set in case of TPM2.\n\nCommit fdc915f7f719 (\"tpm: expose spaces via a device link /dev/tpmrm<n>\")\nalready introduced function tpm_devs_release() to release the extra\nreference but did not implement the required put on chip->devs that results\nin the call of this function.\n\nFix this by putting chip->devs in tpm_chip_unregister().\n\nFinally move the new implementation for the TPM 2 handling into a new\nfunction to avoid multiple checks for the TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 flag in the\ngood case and error
