This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wpexpertsio/post-smtp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a21d9ca05b7d06afc9af2715c692d63c077b5308"}]}],"versions":["2.0.1","2.0.10","2.0.11","2.0.12","2.0.13","2.0.14","2.0.15","2.0.16","2.0.17","2.0.18","2.0.19","2.0.2","2.0.20","2.0.21","2.0.22","2.0.23","2.0.24","2.0.25","2.0.25-beta.1","2.0.26","2.0.27","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.0.8","2.0.9","2.1","2.1-beta.1","2.1.1","2.1.1.1","2.1.10","2.1.2","2.1.2-beta-1","2.1.2-rc.1","2.1.2-rc.2","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.4-beta.1","2.1.4-rc.1","2.1.4-rc.2","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.1.7","2.1.8","2.1.9","2.2","2.2-beta.1","2.2-beta.2","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.3","2.3.1","2.4","2.4-beta.1","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.4.2-beta.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","2.4.5","2.4.6","2.4.7","2.4.8","2.4.9","2.5-beta.1","2.5-rc.1","2.5-rc.2","2.5-rc.3","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.5.4","2.5.5","2.5.6","2.5.7","2.5.8","2.5.9","2.5.9-beta.1","2.5.9.3","2.5.9.4","2.6.0","2.7.0","2.7.2","2.8.3","2.8.4","2.8.5","2.8.7","2.8.8","2.9.0","2.9.1","2.9.10","2.9.11","2.9.12","2.9.13","2.9.14","2.9.2","2.9.3","2.9.4","2.9.5","2.9.6","2.9.7","2.9.8","2.9.9","3.0.0","3.0.0-beta.1","3.0.0-rc.1","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.1.2","v.1.9.0","v.1.9.1","v.1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v1.9.6","v1.9.7","v1.9.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-13844.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://gist.github.com/nhienit2010/d4692062f54b89e16aa068a0ef142cf6#file-postmanemailquerylog-php-L314"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-smtp/#developers"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0540f70d-009a-4776-8717-f096e30a11d3?source=cve"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3249371/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
