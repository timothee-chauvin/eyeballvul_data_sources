{
  "id": "CVE-2021-41034",
  "details": "The build of some language stacks of Eclipse Che version 6 includes pulling some binaries from an unsecured HTTP endpoint. As a consequence the builds of such stacks are vulnerable to MITM attacks that allow the replacement of the original binaries with arbitrary ones. The stacks involved are Java 8 (alpine and centos), Android and PHP. The vulnerability is not exploitable at runtime but only when building Che.",
