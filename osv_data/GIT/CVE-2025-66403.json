Prior to 2.2.3, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Filerise application due to improper handling of uploaded SVG files. The application accepts user-supplied SVG uploads without sanitizing or restricting embedded script content. When a malicious SVG containing inline JavaScript or event-based payloads is uploaded, it is later rendered directly in the browser whenever viewed within the application. Because SVGs are XML-based and allow scripting, they execute in the origin context of the application, enabling full stored XSS. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/error311/filerise","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4b83facc97e62238108cefd9edc6d1f06145ac44"}]}],"versions":["1.4.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.13","v1.3.15","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.10","v1.6.11","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.6.9","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.7.5","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.10","v1.8.11","v1.8.12","v1.8.13","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.8.5","v1.8.6","v1.8.7","v1.8.8","v1.8.9","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.10","v1.9.11","v1.9.12","v1.9.13","v1.9.14","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v1.9.6","v1.9.7","v1.9.8","v1.9.9","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.1.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66403.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66403.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/error311/FileRise/commit/f2ce43f18f0444f8f63f7c33758d1837dd5ba91e"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/error311/FileRise/security/advisories/GHSA-qrcv-vjvf-fr29"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66403"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66403.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
