{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-28097","published":"2023-03-15T22:03:41Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:36:33.845957Z","aliases":["GHSA-c6j5-f4h4-2xrq"],"summary":"OpenSIPS has vulnerability in the Content-Length Parser","details":"OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6, a malformed SIP message containing a large _Content-Length_ value and a specially crafted Request-URI causes a segmentation fault in OpenSIPS. This issue occurs when a large amount of shared memory using the `-m` flag was allocated to OpenSIPS, such as 10 GB of RAM. On the test system, this issue occurred when shared memory was set to `2362` or higher. This issue is fixed in versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6. The only workaround is to guarantee that the Content-Length value of input messages is never larger than `2147483647`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opensips/opensips","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"949719bf4baeb5da9787b9c4191e061fe800d9eb"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opensips/opensips","events":[{"introduced":"1e94abe8837fe3511fada132d67a6385d8d099a2"},{"fixed":"ce8cda891ce6cc48ff7dc2e75f683e4e45798c6c"}]}],"versions":["1.11.0","2.1-alpha1","2.1-alpha2","2.1-alpha3","2.1-rc1","3.1.0","3.1.0-beta","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.1.4","3.1.5","3.1.6","3.1.7","3.1.8","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.2.4","3.2.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-28097.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-c6j5-f4h4-2xrq"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/7cab422e2fc648f910abba34f3f0dbb3ae171ff5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-190"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
