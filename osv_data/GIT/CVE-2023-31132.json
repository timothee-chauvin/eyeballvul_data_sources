{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-31132","published":"2023-09-05T21:19:22.831Z","modified":"2025-12-04T23:50:05.670086Z","aliases":["GHSA-rf5w-pq3f-9876"],"summary":"Cacti Privilege Escalation","details":"Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected versions are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability. A low-privileged OS user with access to a Windows host where Cacti is installed can create arbitrary PHP files in a web document directory. The user can then execute the PHP files under the security context of SYSTEM. This allows an attacker to escalate privilege from a normal user account to SYSTEM. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cacti/cacti","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"18500fa313a9f1ee1be48aa111c0eeea001010fa"}]}],"versions":["releaes/1.2.19","release/1.0.0","release/1.0.1","release/1.0.2","release/1.0.3","release/1.0.4","release/1.0.5","release/1.0.6","release/1.1.0","release/1.1.1","release/1.1.11","release/1.1.12","release/1.1.13","release/1.1.14","release/1.1.15","release/1.1.16","release/1.1.17","release/1.1.18","release/1.1.19","release/1.1.2","release/1.1.20","release/1.1.21","release/1.1.22","release/1.1.23","release/1.1.24","release/1.1.25","release/1.1.26","release/1.1.27","release/1.1.28","release/1.1.29","release/1.1.3","release/1.1.30","release/1.1.31","release/1.1.32","release/1.1.33","release/1.1.34","release/1.1.35","release/1.1.36","release/1.1.37","release/1.1.38","release/1.1.4","release/1.1.5","release/1.1.6","release/1.1.7","release/1.1.8","release/1.2.0","release/1.2.0-beta1","release/1.2.0-beta2","release/1.2.0-beta3","release/1.2.0-beta4","release/1.2.1","release/1.2.10","release/1.2.11","release/1.2.12","release/1.2.13","release/1.2.14","release/1.2.15","release/1.2.16","release/1.2.17","release/1.2.18","release/1.2.19","release/1.2.2","release/1.2.20","release/1.2.21","release/1.2.22","release/1.2.23","release/1.2.24","release/1.2.3","release/1.2.4","release/1.2.5","release/1.2.6","release/1.2.7","release/1.2.8","release/1.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-31132.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/31xxx/CVE-2023-31132.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-rf5w-pq3f-9876"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CFH3J2WVBKY4ZJNMARVOWJQK6PSLPHFH/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WOQFYGLZBAWT4AWNMO7DU73QXWPXTCKH/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGB2UXJEUYWWA6IWVFQ3ZTP22FIHMGN/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31132"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-306"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/31xxx/CVE-2023-31132.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
