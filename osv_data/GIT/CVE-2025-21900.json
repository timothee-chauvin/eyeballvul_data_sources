When that happens, the call\nto put_nfs_open_context() can trigger a synchronous delegreturn call\nwhich deadlocks because it is not marked as privileged.\n\nInstead, ensure that the call to nfs4_inode_return_delegation_on_close()\ncatches the delegreturn, and schedules it asynchronously.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"adb4b42d19aea91826621a8d0bac94cf2c08f8bc"},{"fixed":"4fe4ae6c2e01d028856b73b6328b12b8945df871"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"adb4b42d19aea91826621a8d0bac94cf2c08f8bc"},{"fixed":"f41a60bc43e7abbc636fee78bed0d74c31e738b0"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"adb4b42d19aea91826621a8d0bac94cf2c08f8bc"},{"fixed":"8f8df955f078e1a023ee55161935000a67651f38"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.13.1","v6.13.2","v6.13.3","v6.13.4","v6.13.5","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21900.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.11.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.18"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.13.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21900.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4fe4ae6c2e01d028856b73b6328b12b8945df871"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8f8df955f078e1a023ee55161935000a67651f38"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f41a60bc43e7abbc636fee78bed0d74c31e738b0"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
