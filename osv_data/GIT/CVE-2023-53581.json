This opens a possibility for race condition when the flow\nis concurrently removed from unready_flows list by the workqueue task,\nwhich causes a double-removal from the list and a crash[0]. Fix the issue\nby moving the flag check inside the section protected by\nuplink_priv->unready_flows_lock mutex.\n\n[0]:\n[44376.389654] general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address
