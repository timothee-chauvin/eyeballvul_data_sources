  "details": "Rizin is a UNIX-like reverse engineering framework and command-line toolset. In version 0.5.1 and prior, converting a GDB registers profile file into a Rizin register profile can result in a stack-based buffer overflow when the `name`, `type`, or `groups` fields have longer values than expected. Users opening untrusted GDB registers files (e.g. with the `drpg` or `arpg` commands) are affected by this flaw. Commit d6196703d89c84467b600ba2692534579dc25ed4 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, review the GDB register profiles before loading them with `drpg`/`arpg` commands.",
