{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-48892","published":"2024-08-21T06:10:24.407Z","modified":"2025-12-04T11:38:12.100459Z","summary":"sched/core: Fix use-after-free bug in dup_user_cpus_ptr()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/core: Fix use-after-free bug in dup_user_cpus_ptr()\n\nSince commit 07ec77a1d4e8 (\"sched: Allow task CPU affinity to be\nrestricted on asymmetric systems\"), the setting and clearing of\nuser_cpus_ptr are done under pi_lock for arm64 architecture. However,\ndup_user_cpus_ptr() accesses user_cpus_ptr without any lock\nprotection. Since sched_setaffinity() can be invoked from another\nprocess, the process being modified may be undergoing fork() at\nthe same time.  When racing with the clearing of user_cpus_ptr in\n__set_cpus_allowed_ptr_locked(), it can lead to user-after-free and\npossibly double-free in arm64 kernel.\n\nCommit 8f9ea86fdf99 (\"sched: Always preserve the user requested\ncpumask\") fixes this problem as user_cpus_ptr, once set, will never\nbe cleared in a task's lifetime. However, this bug was re-introduced\nin commit 851a723e45d1 (\"sched: Always clear user_cpus_ptr in\ndo_set_cpus_allowed()\") which allows the clearing of user_cpus_ptr in\ndo_set_cpus_allowed(). This time, it will affect all arches.\n\nFix this bug by always clearing the user_cpus_ptr of the newly\ncloned/forked task before the copying process starts and check the\nuser_cpus_ptr state of the source task under pi_lock.\n\nNote to stable, this patch won't be applicable to stable releases.\nJust copy the new dup_user_cpus_ptr() function over.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"07ec77a1d4e82526e1588979fff2f024f8e96df2"},{"fixed":"b22faa21b6230d5eccd233e1b7e0026a5002b287"},{"fixed":"7b5cc7fd1789ea5dbb942c9f8207b076d365badc"},{"fixed":"87ca4f9efbd7cc649ff43b87970888f2812945b8"}]}],"versions":["v5.13","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-48892.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.15.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.89"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-48892.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7b5cc7fd1789ea5dbb942c9f8207b076d365badc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/87ca4f9efbd7cc649ff43b87970888f2812945b8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b22faa21b6230d5eccd233e1b7e0026a5002b287"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/48xxx/CVE-2022-48892.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48892"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/48xxx/CVE-2022-48892.json"}}
