The Samba Active Directory Domain Controller can be configured to use a custom script to check for password complexity. This configuration can fail to verify password complexity when non-ASCII characters are used in the password, which could lead to weak passwords being set for samba users, making it vulnerable to dictionary attacks.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/samba-team/samba","events":[{"introduced":"916fab083a8cb5c10365da7f3a85d0bbfde4a30e"},{"fixed":"0d69a39c463ea7da23f3b2d1aecedb2d6bbcfd15"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-14833.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/05/msg00023.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00013.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OKPYHDFI7HRELVXBE5J4MTGSI35AKFBI/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UMIYCYXCPRTVCVZ3TP6ZGPJ6RZS3IX4G/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XQ3IUACPZJXSC4OM6P2V4IC4QMZQZWPD/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2019-14833.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-11/msg00015.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-14833"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.synology.com/security/advisory/Synology_SA_19_35"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
