Prior to version 0.6.4, a race condition vulnerability exists in the shared HTTP client configuration. The global `defaultClient` is mutated during request execution without synchronization, directly modifying the shared `http.Client`'s `Transport`, `Timeout`, and `CheckRedirect` properties. Impacted applications include that that use axios4go with concurrent requests (multiple goroutines, `GetAsync`, `PostAsync`, etc.), those where different requests use different proxy configurations, and those that handle sensitive data (authentication credentials, tokens, API keys). Version 0.6.4 fixes this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rezmoss/axios4go","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b651604c64e66a115ab90cdab358b0181d74a842"},{"fixed":"bc21ffb4e5fa9a743c7dbfac4c72764f97921444"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-21697.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rezmoss/axios4go/releases/tag/v0.6.4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rezmoss/axios4go/security/advisories/GHSA-cmj9-27wj-7x47"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rezmoss/axios4go/commit/b651604c64e66a115ab90cdab358b0181d74a842"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
