While the former is unlikely, the latter\nis valid (future) use case and will cause NPD when someone will\ntry to dump PAT settings by debugfs.\n\nIt's better to check pointer to pat.ops instead of specific .dump\nhook, as we have this hook always defined for every .ops variant.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"dd08ebf6c3525a7ea2186e636df064ea47281987"},{"fixed":"583ce246c7ff9edeb0de49130cdc3d45db8545cb"},{"fixed":"a918e771e6fbe1fa68932af5b0cdf473e23090cc"}]}],"versions":["v6.7","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7","v6.9.1","v6.9.2","v6.9.3","v6.9.4","v6.9.5","v6.9.6","v6.9.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-42091.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.9.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-42091.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/583ce246c7ff9edeb0de49130cdc3d45db8545cb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a918e771e6fbe1fa68932af5b0cdf473e23090cc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/42xxx/CVE-2024-42091.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42091"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/42xxx/CVE-2024-42091.json"}}
