Versions prior to 2.9.10 contain a denial of service vulnerability similar to GHSA-859r-vvv8-rm8r/CVE-2025-47947. The `sanitiseArg` (and `sanitizeArg` - this is the same action but an alias) is vulnerable to adding an excessive number of arguments, thereby leading to denial of service. Version 2.9.10 fixes the issue. As a workaround, avoid using rules that contain the  `sanitiseArg` (or `sanitizeArg`) action.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/modsecurity","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3a54ccea62d3f7151bb08cb78d60c5e90b53ca2e"}]}],"versions":["v2.7.2","v2.7.3","v2.7.4","v2.7.5","v2.7.6","v2.7.7","v2.9.0","v2.9.0-rc1","v2.9.0-rc2","v2.9.1","v2.9.1-rc1","v2.9.2","v2.9.3","v2.9.4","v2.9.5","v2.9.6","v2.9.7","v2.9.8","v2.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48866.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/spiderlabs/modsecurity","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0923377d6d618e4cf6cc56ac67ce385bb60127e9"}]}],"versions":["v2.7.2","v2.7.3","v2.7.4","v2.7.5","v2.7.6","v2.7.7","v2.9.0","v2.9.0-rc1","v2.9.0-rc2","v2.9.1","v2.9.1-rc1","v2.9.2","v2.9.3","v2.9.4","v2.9.5","v2.9.6","v2.9.7","v2.9.8","v2.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48866.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/commit/3a54ccea62d3f7151bb08cb78d60c5e90b53ca2e"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/security/advisories/GHSA-859r-vvv8-rm8r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/security/advisories/GHSA-f82j-8pp7-cw2w"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-(v2.x)#sanitisearg"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/06/msg00009.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1050"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
