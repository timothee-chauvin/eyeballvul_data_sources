Prior to version 1.4.3, an attacker can write a malicious expression that escapes the sandbox to execute arbitrary code on the system. With a more complex (undisclosed) payload, one can get full access to Arbitrary code execution on the system. The problem has been patched in version 1.4.3 of Angular Expressions. Two possible workarounds are available. One may either disable access to `__proto__` globally or make sure that one uses the function with just one argument.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/peerigon/angular-expressions","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e422a8c9abd22c7c450131f89283515f68893daa"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.10","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.1.8","v1.1.9","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-54152.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/peerigon/angular-expressions/security/advisories/GHSA-5462-4vcx-jh7j"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/peerigon/angular-expressions/commit/97f7ad94006156eeb97fc942332578b6cfbf8eef"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
