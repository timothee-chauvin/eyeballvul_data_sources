  "id": "CVE-2022-31195",
  "details": "DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. In affected versions the ItemImportServiceImpl is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. This means a malicious SAF (simple archive format) package could cause a file/directory to be created anywhere the Tomcat/DSpace user can write to on the server. However, this path traversal vulnerability is only possible by a user with special privileges (either Administrators or someone with command-line access to the server). This vulnerability impacts the XMLUI, JSPUI and command-line. Users are advised to upgrade. As a basic workaround, users may block all access to the following URL paths: If you are using the XMLUI, block all access to /admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path \"/xmlui\", then you'd need to block access to /xmlui/admin/batchimport. If you are using the JSPUI, block all access to /dspace-admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path \"/jspui\", then you'd need to block access to /jspui/dspace-admin/batchimport. Keep in mind, only an Administrative user or a user with command-line access to the server is able to import/upload SAF packages. Therefore, assuming those users do not blindly upload untrusted SAF packages, then it is unlikely your site could be impacted by this vulnerability.",
