{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-31195","published":"2022-08-01T20:35:11Z","modified":"2025-11-19T09:15:05.651273Z","aliases":["GHSA-8rmh-55h4-93h5"],"summary":"Path traversal vulnerability in Simple Archive Format package import in DSpace","details":"DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. In affected versions the ItemImportServiceImpl is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. This means a malicious SAF (simple archive format) package could cause a file/directory to be created anywhere the Tomcat/DSpace user can write to on the server. However, this path traversal vulnerability is only possible by a user with special privileges (either Administrators or someone with command-line access to the server). This vulnerability impacts the XMLUI, JSPUI and command-line. Users are advised to upgrade. As a basic workaround, users may block all access to the following URL paths: If you are using the XMLUI, block all access to /admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path \"/xmlui\", then you'd need to block access to /xmlui/admin/batchimport. If you are using the JSPUI, block all access to /dspace-admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path \"/jspui\", then you'd need to block access to /jspui/dspace-admin/batchimport. Keep in mind, only an Administrative user or a user with command-line access to the server is able to import/upload SAF packages. Therefore, assuming those users do not blindly upload untrusted SAF packages, then it is unlikely your site could be impacted by this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dspace/dspace","events":[{"introduced":"0fea17436854acf9048b0e11fbf988333ea02956"},{"fixed":"66647c7bf939b202a4872d4c5ebda23bc62e807f"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"6.0"},{"fixed":"6.4"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dspace/dspace","events":[{"introduced":"d34e7b89a30b5ffd35556d6fe8936e5d8659415d"},{"fixed":"d1795b598aa78c37cade6fbc83c8e4141f865a6e"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"4.0"},{"fixed":"5.11"}]}}],"versions":["dspace-4.0","dspace-5.0","dspace-5.0-rc1","dspace-5.0-rc2","dspace-5.0-rc3","dspace-5.1","dspace-5.10","dspace-5.2","dspace-5.3","dspace-5.4","dspace-5.5","dspace-5.6","dspace-5.7","dspace-5.8","dspace-5.9","dspace-6.0","dspace-6.1","dspace-6.2","dspace-6.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31195.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/56e76049185bbd87c994128a9d77735ad7af0199"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/7af52a0883a9dbc475cf3001f04ed11b24c8a4c0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-8rmh-55h4-93h5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
