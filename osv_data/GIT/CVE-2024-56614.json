Due to implicit type conversion, a large unsigned value for\nmap->max_entries can bypass the intended bounds check:\n\n\tif (k >= map->max_entries)\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\nThis allows k to hold a negative value (between -2147483648 and -2),\nwhich is then used as an array index in m->xsk_map[k], which results\nin an out-of-bounds access.\n\n\tspin_lock_bh(&m->lock);\n\tmap_entry =

map_entry);\n\tspin_unlock_bh(&m->lock);\n\nThe xchg operation can then be used to cause an out-of-bounds write.\nMoreover, the invalid map_entry passed to xsk_map_sock_delete can lead\nto further memory corruption.\n\"\n\nIt indeed results in following splat:\n\n[76612.897343] BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffc8fc2e461108\n[76612.904330] #PF: supervisor write access in kernel
