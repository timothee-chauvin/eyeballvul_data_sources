If an affected version of libpq was used with \"host\" or \"hostaddr\" connection parameters from untrusted input, attackers could bypass client-side connection security features, obtain access to higher privileged connections or potentially cause other impact through SQL injection, by causing the PQescape() functions to malfunction. Postgresql versions before 10.5, 9.6.10, 9.5.14, 9.4.19, and 9.3.24 are affected.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git","events":[{"introduced":"da645b3a73580ac30cf02e932b42d06157b98229"},{"fixed":"e0fb7a2ce39f25cbbbe50c95aebdab1ee3beff23"}]}],"versions":["REL9_3_0","REL9_3_1","REL9_3_10","REL9_3_11","REL9_3_12","REL9_3_13","REL9_3_14","REL9_3_15","REL9_3_16","REL9_3_17","REL9_3_18","REL9_3_19","REL9_3_2","REL9_3_20","REL9_3_21","REL9_3_22","REL9_3_23","REL9_3_3","REL9_3_4","REL9_3_5","REL9_3_6","REL9_3_7","REL9_3_8","REL9_3_9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-10915.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105054"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041446"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2511"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2557"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2565"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2566"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2643"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2721"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2729"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3816"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-10915"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/08/msg00012.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201810-08"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3744-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4269"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1878/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-08/msg00043.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
