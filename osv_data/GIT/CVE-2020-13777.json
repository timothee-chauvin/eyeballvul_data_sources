The earliest affected version is 3.6.4 (2018-09-24) because of an error in a 2018-09-18 commit. Until the first key rotation, the TLS server always uses wrong data in place of an encryption key derived from an application.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gnutls/gnutls","events":[{"introduced":"b4366978ae5bce1d7ccb5a8751c4f2431517edd4"},{"fixed":"87166be33d6d51ed02dc178e3e6cd64cd5778aad"}]}],"versions":["3.6.12","3.6.13","3.6.14","gnutls_3_6_0","gnutls_3_6_0_1","gnutls_3_6_1","gnutls_3_6_10","gnutls_3_6_11","gnutls_3_6_11_1","gnutls_3_6_12","gnutls_3_6_2","gnutls_3_6_3","gnutls_3_6_4","gnutls_3_6_5","gnutls_3_6_6","gnutls_3_6_7","gnutls_3_6_9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-13777.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-06/msg00015.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6C4DHUKV6M6SJ5CV6KVHZNHNF7HCUE5P/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6RTXZOXC4MHTFE2HKY6IAZMF2WHD2WMV/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RRQBFK3UZ7SV76IYDTS4PS6ABS2DSJHK/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VMB3UGI5H5RCFRU6OGRPMNUCNLJGEN7Y/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202006-01"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200619-0004/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4384-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4697"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
