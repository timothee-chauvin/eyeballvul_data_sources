For attributes that control queue limits, the\nstore operation will also lock the queue limits with a call to\nqueue_limits_start_update(). However, some drivers (e.g. SCSI sd) may\nneed to issue commands to a device to obtain limit values from the\nhardware with the queue limits locked. This creates a potential ABBA\ndeadlock situation if a user attempts to modify a limit (thus freezing\nthe device queue) while the device driver starts a revalidation of the\ndevice queue limits.\n\nAvoid such deadlock by not freezing the queue before calling the\n->store_limit() method in struct queue_sysfs_entry and instead use the\nqueue_limits_commit_update_frozen helper to freeze the queue after taking\nthe limits lock.\n\nThis also removes taking the sysfs lock for the store_limit method as\nit doesn't protect anything here, but creates even more nesting.\nHopefully it will go away from the actual sysfs methods entirely soon.\n\n(commit log adapted from a similar patch from  Damien Le Moal)","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0327ca9d53bfbb0918867313049bba7046900f73"},{"fixed":"8985da5481562e96b95e94ed8e5cc9b6565eb82b"},{"fixed":"c99f66e4084a62a2cc401c4704a84328aeddc9ec"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.13.1","v6.8","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21807.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.9.0"},{"fixed":"6.13.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21807.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8985da5481562e96b95e94ed8e5cc9b6565eb82b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c99f66e4084a62a2cc401c4704a84328aeddc9ec"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/21xxx/CVE-2025-21807.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21807"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/21xxx/CVE-2025-21807.json"}}
