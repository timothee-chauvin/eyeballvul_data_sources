{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-39334","published":"2022-11-25T00:00:00Z","modified":"2025-10-21T19:33:06Z","aliases":["GHSA-82xx-98xv-4jxv"],"related":["openSUSE-SU-2023:0090-1","openSUSE-SU-2023:0171-1"],"summary":"nextcloudcmd incorrectly trusts bad TLS certificates","details":"Nextcloud also ships a CLI utility called nextcloudcmd which is sometimes used for automated scripting and headless servers. Versions of nextcloudcmd prior to 3.6.1 would incorrectly trust invalid TLS certificates, which may enable a Man-in-the-middle attack that exposes sensitive data or credentials to a network attacker. This affects the CLI only. It does not affect the standard GUI desktop Nextcloud clients, and it does not affect the Nextcloud server.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5dfc0caab65080b4c3c8c3ac42bac766c11ea28c"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39334.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-82xx-98xv-4jxv"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/5022"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/issues/4927"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1699740"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-295"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
