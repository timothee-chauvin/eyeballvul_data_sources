{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-37869","published":"2025-05-09T06:43:58.083Z","modified":"2025-12-05T09:09:55.124276Z","summary":"drm/xe: Use local fence in error path of xe_migrate_clear","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe: Use local fence in error path of xe_migrate_clear\n\nThe intent of the error path in xe_migrate_clear is to wait on locally\ngenerated fence and then return. The code is waiting on m->fence which\ncould be the local fence but this is only stable under the job mutex\nleading to a possible UAF. Fix code to wait on local fence.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 762b7e95362170b3e13a8704f38d5e47eca4ba74)","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"dd08ebf6c3525a7ea2186e636df064ea47281987"},{"fixed":"2ac5f466f62892a7d1ac2d1a3eb6cd14efbe2f2d"},{"fixed":"dc712938aa26b001f448d5e93f59d57fa80f2dbd"},{"fixed":"20659d3150f1a2a258a173fe011013178ff2a197"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.14.1","v6.14.2","v6.14.3","v6.15-rc1","v6.7","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-37869.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.25"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.14.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-37869.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/20659d3150f1a2a258a173fe011013178ff2a197"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2ac5f466f62892a7d1ac2d1a3eb6cd14efbe2f2d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dc712938aa26b001f448d5e93f59d57fa80f2dbd"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/37xxx/CVE-2025-37869.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37869"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/37xxx/CVE-2025-37869.json"}}
