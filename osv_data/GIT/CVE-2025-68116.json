{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68116","published":"2025-12-16T16:43:30.338Z","modified":"2025-12-17T02:48:45.780521Z","aliases":["GHSA-35pp-ggh6-c59c"],"summary":"FileRise vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in SVG File Handling","details":"FileRise is a self-hosted web file manager / WebDAV server. Versions prior to 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to unsafe handling of browser-renderable user uploads when served through the sharing and download endpoints. An attacker who can get a crafted SVG (primary) or HTML (secondary) file stored in a FileRise instance can cause JavaScript execution when a victim opens a generated share link (and in some cases via the direct download endpoint). This impacts share links (`/api/file/share.php`) and direct file access / download path (`/api/file/download.php`), depending on browser/content-type behavior. Version 2.7.1 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/error311/filerise","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0ad340942b268c31197aa140b2c3daa16921ec88"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.7.1"}]}}],"versions":["1.4.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.13","v1.3.15","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.10","v1.6.11","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.6.9","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.7.5","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.10","v1.8.11","v1.8.12","v1.8.13","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.8.5","v1.8.6","v1.8.7","v1.8.8","v1.8.9","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.10","v1.9.11","v1.9.12","v1.9.13","v1.9.14","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v1.9.6","v1.9.7","v1.9.8","v1.9.9","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.1.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.7","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.7.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68116.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68116.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/error311/FileRise/security/advisories/GHSA-35pp-ggh6-c59c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68116"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68116.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
