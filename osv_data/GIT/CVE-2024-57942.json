This presents a problem for netfs_pgpriv2_write_to_the_cache(),\nwhich is used to write folios marked with PG_private_2 to the cache as it\nexpects to be able to trawl the folio_queue list thereafter to find the\nrelevant folios, leading to a hang.\n\nFix this by not clearing the folio_queue entry if we're going to do the\ndeprecated copy-to-cache.  The clearance will be done instead as the folios\nare written to the cache.\n\nThis can be reproduced by starting cachefiles, mounting a ceph filesystem\nwith \"-o fsc\" and writing to it.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ee4cdf7ba857a894ad1650d6ab77669cbbfa329e"},{"fixed":"43b8d3249b0b71bad239d42dbe08ce6c938ba000"},{"fixed":"38cf8e945721ffe708fa675507465da7f4f2a9f7"}]}],"versions":["v6.11","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-57942.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-57942.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/38cf8e945721ffe708fa675507465da7f4f2a9f7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/43b8d3249b0b71bad239d42dbe08ce6c938ba000"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/57xxx/CVE-2024-57942.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-57942"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/57xxx/CVE-2024-57942.json"}}
