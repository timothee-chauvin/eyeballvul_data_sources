This has been patched and is available in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1). We recommend that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately. This vulnerability was found in-house and we haven't been notified of any potential exploiters. ### Additional notes * Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt user data. This includes filenames, paths, and all key-value data. * Users running the official Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md) are at minimal risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm","events":[{"introduced":"e5541276ab997466569ddf3fc12dffe8034a0920"},{"fixed":"24b4bbdd7ee0a98f2b68973999f47f79799bd368"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.10.3","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-29180.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/29xxx/CVE-2022-29180.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/commit/3c90668f955c7ce5ef721e4fc9faee7053232fd3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/security/advisories/GHSA-4wpp-w5r4-7v5v"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29180"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/29xxx/CVE-2022-29180.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
