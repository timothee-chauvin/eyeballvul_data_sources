Example: When we do\nperf record, default cycles and instructions will be running on PMC6\nand PMC5 respectively. It could happen that overflowed event is currently\nnot active and pending PMI is for the inactive event.

Reference commit:\ncommit bc09c219b2e6 (\"powerpc/perf: Fix finding overflowed PMC in interrupt\")\n\nPatch addresses two changes:\n1) Fix 1 : Removal of warning ( WARN_ON(pmi_irq_pending()); )\n   We were printing warning if no PMC is found overflown among active PMU\n   events, but PMI pending in PACA. But this could happen in cases where\n   PMC overflown is not in active PMC. An inactive event could have caused\n   the overflow. Hence the warning is not needed. To know pending PMI is\n   from an inactive event, we need to loop through all PMC's which will\n   cause more SPR reads via mfspr and increase in context switch. Also in\n   existing function: perf_event_interrupt, already we ignore PMI's\n   overflown when it is from an inactive PMC.\n\n2) Fix 2: optimization in clearing pending PMI.\n   Currently we check for any active PMC overflown before clearing PMI\n   pending in Paca. This is causing additional
