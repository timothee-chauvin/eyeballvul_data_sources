This could lead to derived information disclosure on private lists about the timing of specific email subjects or text bodies, though without disclosing the content itself. As this was primarily used as a caching feature for faster loading times, the caching was disabled by default to prevent this. Users using 0.9 should upgrade to 0.10 to address this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-ponymail","events":[{"introduced":"db2596f1083154cef2a1fb73fe9b5d13ad5ae482"},{"last_affected":"116797982cec1e483349ed48a397e0b0cdad5b1d"}]}],"versions":["0.7b","0.8b","0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-5658.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/6a18cf5690d54231836f277f2b4346b53da3b6b6b08fee4c4ef4977e%40%3Cdev.ponymail.apache.org%3E"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
