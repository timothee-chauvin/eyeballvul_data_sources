{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-5455","published":"2024-01-10T13:15:48Z","modified":"2025-10-21T17:07:11.890300Z","related":["ALSA-2024:0141","ALSA-2024:0143"],"details":"A Cross-site request forgery vulnerability exists in ipa/session/login_password in all supported versions of IPA. This flaw allows an attacker to trick the user into submitting a request that could perform actions as the user, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity. During community penetration testing it was found that for certain HTTP end-points FreeIPA does not ensure CSRF protection. Due to implementation details one cannot use this flaw for reflection of a cookie representing already logged-in user. An attacker would always have to go through a new authentication attempt.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9c617675d6676fcdb0e9d67fed6bb801e0066bfe"}]}],"versions":["alpha-1-9-0","alpha_1-4-2-0","alpha_1-4-4-0","alpha_2-1-9-0","alpha_3-1-9-0","alpha_4-1-9-0","alpha_5-1-9-0","alpha_5-1-9-0-1","beta_1-2-0-0","beta_1-3-0-0","beta_1-3-2-0","beta_1-3-3-0","beta_2-3-0-0","beta_2-3-3-0","milestone_2","milestone_3","milestone_4","milestone_4_1","milestone_6","rc_1-2-0-0","rc_2-2-0-0","rc_3-2-0-0","release-1-0-0","release-1-1-0","release-2-0-0","release-2-1-0","release-3-1-0","release-3-2-0","release-3-2-0-pre1","release-3-3-0","release-4-0-0","release-4-2-0","release-4-4-0","release-4-4-1","release-4-6-0","release-4-6-1","release-4-6-2","release-4-6-3","release-4-6-4","release-4-6-5","release-4-6-6","release-4-6-8","release-4-6-9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-5455.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0137"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0138"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0139"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0140"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0141"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0142"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0143"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0144"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0145"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0252"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-5455"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2242828"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.freeipa.org/release-notes/4-10-3.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.freeipa.org/release-notes/4-11-1.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.freeipa.org/release-notes/4-6-10.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.freeipa.org/release-notes/4-9-14.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U76DAZZVY7V4XQBOOV5ETPTHW3A6MW5O/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UFNUQH7IOHTKCTKQWFHONWGUBOUANL6I/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
