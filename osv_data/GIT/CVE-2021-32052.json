If an application uses values with newlines in an HTTP response, header injection can occur. Django itself is unaffected because HttpResponse prohibits newlines in HTTP headers.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/django/django","events":[{"introduced":"2a62cdcfec85938f40abb2e9e6a9ff497e02afe8"},{"fixed":"df9fd4661e203d41c189054d8b23d256815e14fc"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32052.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/python/cpython","events":[{"introduced":"29360893df0931703cb2fe0c0fbc0fc963e64ead"},{"fixed":"09a7df8301bef5a5ac957371ae9e19c68acdca0a"}]}],"versions":["v3.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32052.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/django-announce"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZVKYPHR3TKR2ESWXBPOJEKRO2OSJRZUE/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/06/1"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/releases/security/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210611-0002/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2021/may/06/security-releases/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
