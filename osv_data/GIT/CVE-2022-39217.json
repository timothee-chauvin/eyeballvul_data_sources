In affected versions this GitHub Action creates a CSV file without sanitizing the output of the APIs. If an alert is dismissed or any other custom field contains executable code / formulas, it might be run when an endpoint opens that CSV file in a spreadsheet program. This issue has been addressed in version `v1`. Users are advised to use `v1` or later. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/some-natalie/ghas-to-csv","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d0b521928fa734513b5cd9c7d9d8e09db50e884a"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"v1"}]}}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39217.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/39xxx/CVE-2022-39217.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/some-natalie/ghas-to-csv/commit/d0b521928fa734513b5cd9c7d9d8e09db50e884a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/some-natalie/ghas-to-csv/security/advisories/GHSA-634p-93h9-92vh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39217"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-74"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/39xxx/CVE-2022-39217.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
