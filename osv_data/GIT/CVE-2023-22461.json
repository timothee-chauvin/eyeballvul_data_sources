{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-22461","published":"2023-01-04T14:57:04Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:09:50.313851Z","aliases":["GHSA-h857-2g56-468g"],"summary":"sanitize-svg Filter Bypass Allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)","details":"The `sanitize-svg` package, a small SVG sanitizer to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, uses a deny-list-pattern to sanitize SVGs to prevent XSS. In doing so, literal `<script>`-tags and on-event handlers were detected in versions prior to 0.4.0. As a result, downstream software that relies on `sanitize-svg` and expects resulting SVGs to be safe, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability was addressed in v0.4.0. There are no known workarounds\n\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mattkrick/sanitize-svg","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b107e453ede7b58adcccae74a3e474c012eec85d"}]}],"versions":["v0.2.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-22461.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mattkrick/sanitize-svg/commit/b107e453ede7b58adcccae74a3e474c012eec85d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/mattkrick/sanitize-svg/security/advisories/GHSA-h857-2g56-468g"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79","CWE-80"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
