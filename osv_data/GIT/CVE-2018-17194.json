{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2018-17194","published":"2018-12-19T14:29:00.440Z","modified":"2025-11-20T10:47:13.522946Z","aliases":["GHSA-43fp-vwwg-qgv6"],"details":"When a client request to a cluster node was replicated to other nodes in the cluster for verification, the Content-Length was forwarded. On a DELETE request, the body was ignored, but if the initial request had a Content-Length value other than 0, the receiving nodes would wait for the body and eventually timeout. Mitigation: The fix to check DELETE requests and overwrite non-zero Content-Length header values was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.8.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/nifi","events":[{"introduced":"74d5224783dfdc513f6b3ad5ed96671d3c581707"},{"last_affected":"241e5411a24435ca2c39ab7bea1c5eb9ed195cb3"}]}],"versions":["docker/nifi-1.2.0","nifi-1.0.0-RC1","nifi-1.1.0-RC2","nifi-1.2.0-RC2","nifi-1.3.0-RC1","nifi-1.5.0-RC1","nifi-1.6.0-RC3","nifi-1.7.0-RC1","nifi-1.7.1-RC1","rel/nifi-1.0.0","rel/nifi-1.1.0","rel/nifi-1.2.0","rel/nifi-1.3.0","rel/nifi-1.4.0","rel/nifi-1.5.0","rel/nifi-1.6.0","rel/nifi-1.7.0","rel/nifi-1.7.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-17194.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nifi.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2018-17194"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
