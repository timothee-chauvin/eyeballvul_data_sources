Prior to version 1.13.0, accepting the value of the `of` option of the `.position()` util from untrusted sources may execute untrusted code. The issue is fixed in jQuery UI 1.13.0. Any string value passed to the `of` option is now treated as a CSS selector. A workaround is to not accept the value of the `of` option from untrusted sources.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"effa323f1505f2ce7a324e4f429fa9032c72f280"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-41184.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/drupal/drupal","events":[{"introduced":"497914920385b7016ac9c9367e0198530787adf2"},{"fixed":"c991d5749144c851b71aa7be721715d7e346526f"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-41184.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00040.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Aug/37"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://blog.jqueryui.com/2021/10/jquery-ui-1-13-0-released/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/effa323f1505f2ce7a324e4f429fa9032c72f280"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-gpqq-952q-5327"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HVKIOWSXL2RF2ULNAP7PHESYCFSZIJE3/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NXIUUBRVLA4E7G7MMIKCEN75YN7UFERW/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/O74SXYY7RGXREQDQUDQD4BPJ4QQTD2XQ/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SGSY236PYSFYIEBRGDERLA7OSY6D7XL4/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SNXA7XRKGINWSUIPIZ6ZBCTV6N3KSHES/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211118-0004/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2022-001"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2022-09"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
