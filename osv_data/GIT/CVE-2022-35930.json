In versions prior to 0.2.1 PolicyController will report a false positive, resulting in an admission when it should not be admitted when there is at least one attestation with a valid signature and there are NO attestations of the type being verified (--type defaults to \"custom\"). An example image that can be used to test this is `ghcr.io/distroless/static@sha256:dd7614b5a12bc4d617b223c588b4e0c833402b8f4991fb5702ea83afad1986e2`. Users should upgrade to version 0.2.1 to resolve this issue. There are no workarounds for users unable to upgrade.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sigstore/policy-controller","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6e9b0b89aaf11af349cf69e287fea64c2c20691f"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.0-rc.1","v0.2.0-rc.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35930.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/policy-controller/security/advisories/GHSA-739f-hw6h-7wq8"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/policy-controller/commit/e852af36fb7d42678b21d7e97503c25bd1fd05c8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/policy-controller/releases/tag/v0.2.1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-347"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
