  "details": "Jupyter Remote Desktop Proxy allows you to run a Linux Desktop on a JupyterHub. jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy was meant to rely on UNIX sockets readable only by the current user since version 3.0.0, but when used with TigerVNC, the VNC server started by jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy were still accessible via the network. This vulnerability does not affect users having TurboVNC as the vncserver executable. This issue is fixed in 3.0.1.",
