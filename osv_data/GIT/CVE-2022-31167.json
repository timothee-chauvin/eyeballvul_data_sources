{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-31167","published":"2022-09-07T13:55:11Z","modified":"2025-10-25T11:33:57Z","aliases":["GHSA-gg53-wf5x-r3r6"],"summary":"XWiki Platform Security Parent POM vulnerable to overwriting of security rules of a page with a final page having the same reference","details":"XWiki Platform Security Parent POM contains the security APIs for XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 5.0 and prior to 12.10.11, 13.10.1, and 13.4.6, a bug in the security cache stores rules associated to document Page1.Page2 and space Page1.Page2 in the same cache entry. That means that it's possible to overwrite the rights of a space or a document by creating the page of the space with the same name and checking the right of the new one first so that they end up in the security cache and are used for the other too. The problem has been patched in XWiki 12.10.11, 13.10.1, and 13.4.6. There are no known workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons","events":[{"introduced":"dc5230e69b18da6030585a398aa722c7ebebaff1"},{"fixed":"75e8654651969f3f8c27a7747939b1ce1a3a3422"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31167.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform","events":[{"introduced":"e20ad8657a7859e0cc4c7e86d360fa494ede584c"},{"fixed":"b72dfa77858847bb8e11b735cf12385520fc2270"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31167.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-gg53-wf5x-r3r6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-14075"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18983"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-285","CWE-862"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
