{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2020-8562","published":"2022-02-01T11:15:10.903Z","modified":"2025-12-06T21:15:25.629245Z","aliases":["GHSA-qh36-44jv-c8xj"],"related":["CGA-33wh-fj62-mr5q","CGA-3w54-c7rr-xjhp"],"details":"As mitigations to a report from 2019 and CVE-2020-8555, Kubernetes attempts to prevent proxied connections from accessing link-local or localhost networks when making user-driven connections to Services, Pods, Nodes, or StorageClass service providers. As part of this mitigation Kubernetes does a DNS name resolution check and validates that response IPs are not in the link-local (169.254.0.0/16) or localhost (127.0.0.0/8) range. Kubernetes then performs a second DNS resolution without validation for the actual connection. If a non-standard DNS server returns different non-cached responses, a user may be able to bypass the proxy IP restriction and access private networks on the control plane.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubelet","events":[{"last_affected":"2f96697a6b8649844ec80a9bbe6d7cde3b197f5b"},{"introduced":"30b4cd52c54df86ed93459ba84b3e61877fc28ea"},{"last_affected":"723e5d932a5277a14f5c636330ac445539bf5708"},{"last_affected":"91407aecd4edbe8888bb4648ee46e8dae792a20d"},{"introduced":"1af8853567a0faecc59fbc4d7d2ddc9359ddde83"},{"last_affected":"ea1348bf4a58d089e74ac7def7f855945a2c0bbb"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-8562.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes","events":[{"last_affected":"6f6ce59dc8fefde25a3ba0ef0047f4ec6662ef24"},{"introduced":"af46c47ce925f4c4ad5cc8d1fca46c7b77d13b38"},{"last_affected":"8a62859e515889f07e3e3be6a1080413f17cf2c3"},{"introduced":"e19964183377d0ec2052d1f1fa930c4d7575bd50"},{"last_affected":"98d5dc5d36d34a7ee13368a7893dcb400ec4e566"},{"last_affected":"cb303e613a121a29364f75cc67d3d580833a7479"}]}],"versions":["v1.19.0","v1.19.1","v1.19.1-rc.0","v1.19.10","v1.19.10-rc.0","v1.19.2","v1.19.2-rc.0","v1.19.3","v1.19.3-rc.0","v1.19.4","v1.19.4-rc.0","v1.19.5","v1.19.5-rc.0","v1.19.6","v1.19.6-rc.0","v1.19.6-rc.1","v1.19.7","v1.19.7-rc.0","v1.19.8","v1.19.8-rc.0","v1.19.9","v1.19.9-rc.0","v1.20.0","v1.20.1","v1.20.1-rc.0","v1.20.1-rc.1","v1.20.2","v1.20.2-rc.0","v1.20.3","v1.20.3-rc.0","v1.20.4","v1.20.4-rc.0","v1.20.5","v1.20.5-rc.0","v1.20.6","v1.20.6-rc.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-8562.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/101493"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/-MFX60_wdOY"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220225-0002/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
