The `email` field in phpMyFAQ's user control panel page is vulnerable to stored XSS attacks due to the inadequacy of PHP's `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` function, which only validates the email format, not its content. This vulnerability enables an attacker to execute arbitrary client-side JavaScript within the context of another user's phpMyFAQ session. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/thorsten/phpmyfaq","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"de90315c9bd4ead5fe6ba5586f6b016843aa8209"}]}],"versions":["2.10.0-alpha","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.5.4","2.5.5","2.5.6","2.5.7","2.6.0","2.6.0-RC","2.6.0-alpha","2.6.0-beta","2.6.1","2.6.10","2.6.11","2.6.12","2.6.13","2.6.14","2.6.15","2.6.16","2.6.17","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.6.4","2.6.5","2.6.6","2.6.7","2.6.8","2.6.9","2.7.0","2.7.0-RC","2.7.0-alpha","2.7.0-alpha2","2.7.0-beta","2.7.0-beta2","2.7.0-beta3","2.7.1","2.7.2","2.7.3","2.7.4","2.7.5","2.7.6","2.7.7","2.7.8","2.7.9","2.8.0","2.8.0-RC","2.8.0-RC2","2.8.0-RC3","2.8.0-RC4","2.8.0-alpha","2.8.0-alpha2","2.8.0-alpha3","2.8.0-beta","2.8.0-beta2","2.8.0-beta3","2.8.1","2.8.10","2.8.11","2.8.12","2.8.13","2.8.14","2.8.15","2.8.16","2.8.17","2.8.18","2.8.19","2.8.2","2.8.20","2.8.21","2.8.22","2.8.23","2.8.24","2.8.25","2.8.26","2.8.27","2.8.28","2.8.29","2.8.3","2.8.4","2.8.5","2.8.6","2.8.7","2.8.8","2.8.9","2.9.0","2.9.0-RC","2.9.0-RC2","2.9.0-RC3","2.9.0-RC4","2.9.0-alpha","2.9.0-alpha2","2.9.0-alpha3","2.9.0-alpha4","2.9.0-beta","2.9.0-beta2","2.9.1","2.9.2","2.9.3","2.9.4","2.9.5","2.9.6","2.9.7","2.9.8","2.9.9","3.0.0","3.0.0-RC","3.0.0-RC.2","3.0.0-alpha","3.0.0-alpha.2","3.0.0-alpha.3","3.0.0-alpha.4","3.0.0-beta","3.0.0-beta.2","3.0.0-beta.3","3.0.1","3.0.10","3.0.11","3.0.12","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","3.0.8","3.0.9","3.1.0","3.1.0-RC","3.1.0-alpha","3.1.0-alpha.2","3.1.0-alpha.3","3.1.0-beta","3.1.1","3.1.10","3.1.11","3.1.12","3.1.13","3.1.14","3.1.15","3.1.16","3.1.17","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.1.4","3.1.5","3.1.6","3.1.7","3.1.8","3.1.9","3.2.0","3.2.0-RC","3.2.0-RC.2","3.2.0-RC.4","3.2.0-alpha","3.2.0-beta","3.2.0-beta.2","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.2.4","3.2.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-27300.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/security/advisories/GHSA-q7g6-xfh2-vhpx"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/commit/09336b0ff0e0a04aa0c97c5975651af4769d2459"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/commit/de90315c9bd4ead5fe6ba5586f6b016843aa8209"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
