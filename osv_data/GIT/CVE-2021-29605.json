{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-29605","published":"2021-05-14T20:15:15.670Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:15:22.410981Z","aliases":["BIT-tensorflow-2021-29605","GHSA-jf7h-7m85-w2v2","PYSEC-2021-242","PYSEC-2021-533","PYSEC-2021-731"],"related":["GHSA-jf7h-7m85-w2v2"],"details":"TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The TFLite code for allocating `TFLiteIntArray`s is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4ceffae632721e52bf3501b736e4fe9d1221cdfa/tensorflow/lite/c/common.c#L24-L27). An attacker can craft a model such that the `size` multiplier is so large that the return value overflows the `int` datatype and becomes negative. In turn, this results in invalid value being given to `malloc`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4ceffae632721e52bf3501b736e4fe9d1221cdfa/tensorflow/lite/c/common.c#L47-L52). In this case, `ret->size` would dereference an invalid pointer. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7c8cc4ec69cd348e44ad6a2699057ca88faad3e5"}]}],"versions":["0.12.0-rc0","0.12.0-rc1","0.12.1","0.5.0","0.6.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.0rc0","v0.11.0","v0.11.0rc0","v0.11.0rc1","v0.11.0rc2","v0.12.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0rc0","v0.9.0","v0.9.0rc0","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-alpha","v1.0.0-rc0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc0","v1.1.0-rc1","v1.1.0-rc2","v1.12.0","v1.12.0-rc0","v1.12.0-rc1","v1.12.0-rc2","v1.12.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc0","v1.2.0-rc1","v1.2.0-rc2","v1.3.0-rc0","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-rc0","v1.5.0-rc1","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc0","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.8.0","v1.8.0-rc0","v1.8.0-rc1","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-rc0","v1.9.0-rc1","v1.9.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-29605.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"323441467550972796961876012191813987106","length":2617},"id":"CVE-2021-29605-32ce330f","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7c8cc4ec69cd348e44ad6a2699057ca88faad3e5","target":{"file":"tensorflow/lite/kernels/embedding_lookup_sparse.cc","function":"Eval"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["221315807979975374059098528228640698222","321677896654215633058918569989719790380","245538412155565593286451389298289977004","175002120260344073506153491455736600746","111225680948945197111714019309371489331"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2021-29605-4b4578f9","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7c8cc4ec69cd348e44ad6a2699057ca88faad3e5","target":{"file":"tensorflow/lite/c/common.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["64002533412214694302935198588989152734","125987202841411760004254314710669416726","274855496943808702694051502420822628947","277191444918604204656964828627199025460"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2021-29605-eebb9bcb","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7c8cc4ec69cd348e44ad6a2699057ca88faad3e5","target":{"file":"tensorflow/lite/kernels/embedding_lookup_sparse.cc"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7c8cc4ec69cd348e44ad6a2699057ca88faad3e5"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-jf7h-7m85-w2v2"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
