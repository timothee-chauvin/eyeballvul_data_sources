The parameters used for the search are the public key and the payload. The search API returns entries that match either condition rather than both. When gitsign's credential cache is used, there can be multiple entries that use the same ephemeral keypair / signing certificate. As gitsign assumes both conditions are matched by Rekor, there is no additional validation that the entry's hash matches the payload being verified, meaning that the wrong entry can be used to successfully pass verification. Impact is minimal as while gitsign does not match the payload against the entry, it does ensure that the certificate matches. This would need to be exploited during the certificate validity window (10 minutes) by the key holder.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sigstore/gitsign","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8e08985029f0c0e5f0603d20c21864a3a97316cc"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.0-test","v0.0.1-alpha","v0.0.2-alpha","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.9.0","v0.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-51746.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/gitsign/security/advisories/GHSA-8pmp-678w-c8xx"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-706"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
