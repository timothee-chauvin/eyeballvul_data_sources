{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-37457","published":"2023-12-14T19:43:30Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:39:19.907008Z","aliases":["GHSA-98rc-4j27-74hh"],"summary":"Asterisk's PJSIP_HEADER dialplan function can overwrite memory/cause crash when using 'update'","details":"Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit. In Asterisk versions 18.20.0 and prior, 20.5.0 and prior, and 21.0.0; as well as ceritifed-asterisk 18.9-cert5 and prior, the 'update' functionality of the PJSIP_HEADER dialplan function can exceed the available buffer space for storing the new value of a header. By doing so this can overwrite memory or cause a crash. This is not externally exploitable, unless dialplan is explicitly written to update a header based on data from an outside source. If the 'update' functionality is not used the vulnerability does not occur. A patch is available at commit a1ca0268254374b515fa5992f01340f7717113fa.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"5c38e52afcda9c65d422b0f7323d7dc63746dc7f"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"de4f63b4824c91a0cd9f3d95f3b7923bec71960c"},{"last_affected":"c94e2b2000cd9781cd2be7b4050b7f3cde851e01"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"12da95e53ff42287ad69d6d5922e06c3d62010ac"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"b2a1aa2d1090b765d064ef8edda9118c25e2346f"}]}],"versions":["18.17.0","18.17.0-rc1","18.17.1","18.18.0","18.18.0-rc1","18.18.1","18.19.0","18.19.0-rc1","18.19.0-rc2","18.20.0","18.20.0-rc1","18.9.0","18.9.0-rc1","21.0.0","21.0.0-pre1","21.0.0-rc1","certified-18.9-cert4","certified-18.9-cert5","certified/18.9-cert1","certified/18.9-cert1-rc1","certified/18.9-cert2","certified/18.9-cert3","certified/18.9-cert4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-37457.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/security/advisories/GHSA-98rc-4j27-74hh"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/a1ca0268254374b515fa5992f01340f7717113fa"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/12/msg00019.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-120"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
