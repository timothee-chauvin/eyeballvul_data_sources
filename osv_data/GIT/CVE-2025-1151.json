  "details": "A vulnerability was found in GNU Binutils 2.43. It has been rated as problematic. This issue affects the function xmemdup of the file xmemdup.c of the component ld. The manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The code maintainer explains: \"I'm not going to commit some of the leak fixes I've been working on to the 2.44 branch due to concern that would destabilise ld. All of the reported leaks in this bugzilla have been fixed on binutils master.\"",
