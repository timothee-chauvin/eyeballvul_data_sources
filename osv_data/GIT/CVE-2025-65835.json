{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-65835","published":"2025-12-15T19:16:05.373Z","modified":"2026-01-09T07:59:17.400283Z","details":"The Cordova plugin cordova-plugin-x-socialsharing (SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin) for Android 6.0.4, registers an exported broadcast receiver nl.xservices.plugins.ShareChooserPendingIntent with an android.intent.action.SEND intent filter. The onReceive implementation accesses Intent.EXTRA_CHOSEN_COMPONENT without checking for null. If a broadcast is sent with extras present but without EXTRA_CHOSEN_COMPONENT, the code dereferences a null value and throws a NullPointerException. Because the receiver is exported and performs no permission or caller validation, any local application on the device can send crafted ACTION_SEND broadcasts to this component and repeatedly crash the host application, resulting in a local, unauthenticated application-level denial of service for any app that includes the plugin.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/eddyverbruggen/socialsharing-phonegap-plugin","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"3f6f455a021067d99a3e793640ad1362a98a655b"}]}],"versions":["4.3.11","4.3.12","4.3.13","4.3.14","4.3.15","4.3.16","4.3.17","4.3.18","4.3.19","4.3.2","4.3.20","4.3.3","4.3.4","4.3.5","4.3.6","4.3.8","5.0.0","5.0.1","5.0.10","5.0.11","5.0.12","5.0.2","5.0.3","5.0.4","5.0.5","5.0.6","5.0.7","5.0.8","5.1.1","5.1.2","5.1.3","5.1.4","5.1.5","5.1.6","5.1.7","5.1.8","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.4.0","5.4.4","5.4.5","5.4.6","5.6.0","5.6.1","5.6.2","5.6.3","5.6.4","5.6.5","5.6.6","5.6.8","6.0.0","6.0.1","6.0.2","6.0.3","6.0.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65835.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-x-socialsharing"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://medium.com/@lcrawfqrd/local-dos-via-exported-receivers-f6b1da10d3b7"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
