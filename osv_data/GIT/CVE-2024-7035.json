This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, where an unaware user can unintentionally perform sensitive actions by simply visiting a malicious site or through top-level navigation. The affected endpoints include /rag/api/v1/reset, /rag/api/v1/reset/db, /api/v1/memories/reset, and /rag/api/v1/reset/uploads. This impacts both the availability and integrity of the application.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"9bcd4ce5c0a01af68c0d2aa44554a68bb741c61b"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.102","v0.1.103","v0.1.104","v0.1.105","v0.1.106","v0.1.107","v0.1.108","v0.1.109","v0.1.110","v0.1.111","v0.1.112","v0.1.113","v0.1.114","v0.1.115","v0.1.116","v0.1.117","v0.1.118","v0.1.119","v0.1.120","v0.1.121","v0.1.122","v0.1.123","v0.1.124","v0.1.125","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.3.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-7035.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/2ac81740-410b-467a-9244-75d82a6f9e11"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:L"}]}
