{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-67502","published":"2025-12-09T23:53:39.474Z","modified":"2025-12-14T04:48:49.959324Z","aliases":["GHSA-5923-r76v-mprm"],"summary":"Taguette does not safeguard against Open Redirect","details":"Taguette is an open source qualitative research tool. In versions 1.5.1 and below,  attackers can craft malicious URLs that redirect users to arbitrary external websites after authentication. The application accepts a user-controlled next parameter and uses it directly in HTTP redirects without any validation. This can be exploited for phishing attacks where victims believe they are interacting with a trusted Taguette instance but are redirected to a malicious site designed to steal credentials or deliver malware. This issue is fixed in version 1.5.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/remram44/taguette","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bf23807d749dd15aed81ebfd6e3967f00d1353a1"}]}],"versions":["v0.0","v0.1","v0.10","v0.10.1","v0.11","v0.2","v0.3","v0.4","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.5","v0.5-alpha.0","v0.6","v0.7","v0.8","v0.9","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67502.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67502.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/remram44/taguette/commit/67de2d2612e7e2572c61cd9627f89c2bfd0f2a36"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/remram44/taguette/security/advisories/GHSA-5923-r76v-mprm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67502"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-601"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67502.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
