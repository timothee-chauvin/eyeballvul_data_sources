This could lead to the injection of unwanted information into a chart. This issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2 and 2.16.11. A possible workaround is to manually review the `dependencies` field of any untrusted chart, verifying that the `alias` field is either not used, or (if used) does not contain newlines or path characters.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/helm/helm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e7c281564d8306e1dcf8023d97f972449ad74850"}]}],"versions":["1.999.0","v1.0","v1.1","v1.2","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha.1","v2.0.0-alpha.2","v2.0.0-alpha.4","v2.0.0-alpha.5","v2.0.0-beta.1","v2.0.0-beta.2","v2.0.0-rc.1","v2.0.0-rc.2","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.7.0-rc1","v2.8.0-rc.1","v3.0.0-alpha.1","v3.0.0-alpha.2","v3.0.0-beta.1","v3.0.0-beta.2","v3.0.0-beta.3","v3.0.0-beta.4","v3.0.0-beta.5","v3.1.0-rc.1","v3.3.0","v3.3.0-rc.1","v3.3.0-rc.2","v3.3.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-15184.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/e7c281564d8306e1dcf8023d97f972449ad74850"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-9vp5-m38w-j776"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
