This allows a site to set cookies that then would get sent to\ndifferent and unrelated sites and domains.\n\nIt could do this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in curl's function that\nverifies a given cookie domain against the Public Suffix List (PSL). For\nexample a cookie could be set with `domain=co.UK` when the URL used a lower\ncase hostname `curl.co.uk`, even though `co.uk` is listed as a PSL domain.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/curl/curl","events":[{"introduced":"e2ae32ff5f3ab6f0819590f61f248f17df12987f"},{"last_affected":"172e54cda18412da73fd8eb4e444e8a5b371ca59"}]}],"versions":["curl-7_46_0","curl-7_47_0","curl-7_47_1","curl-7_48_0","curl-7_49_0","curl-7_49_1","curl-7_50_0","curl-7_50_1","curl-7_50_2","curl-7_50_3","curl-7_51_0","curl-7_52_0","curl-7_52_1","curl-7_53_0","curl-7_53_1","curl-7_54_0","curl-7_54_1","curl-7_55_0","curl-7_55_1","curl-7_56_0","curl-7_56_1","curl-7_57_0","curl-7_58_0","curl-7_59_0","curl-7_60_0","curl-7_61_0","curl-7_61_1","curl-7_62_0","curl-7_63_0","curl-7_64_0","curl-7_64_1","curl-7_65_0","curl-7_65_1","curl-7_65_2","curl-7_65_3","curl-7_66_0","curl-7_67_0","curl-7_68_0","curl-7_69_0","curl-7_69_1","curl-7_70_0","curl-7_71_0","curl-7_71_1","curl-7_72_0","curl-7_73_0","curl-7_74_0","curl-7_75_0","curl-7_76_0","curl-7_76_1","curl-7_77_0","curl-7_78_0","curl-7_79_0","curl-7_79_1","curl-7_80_0","curl-7_81_0","curl-7_82_0","curl-7_83_0","curl-7_83_1","curl-7_84_0","curl-7_85_0","curl-7_86_0","curl-7_87_0","curl-7_88_0","curl-7_88_1","curl-8_0_0","curl-8_0_1","curl-8_1_0","curl-8_1_1","curl-8_1_2","curl-8_2_0","curl-8_2_1","curl-8_3_0","curl-8_4_0","tiny-curl-8_4_0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-46218.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/12/msg00015.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UOGXU25FMMT2X6UUITQ7EZZYMJ42YWWD/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-46218.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/2212193"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3ZX3VW67N4ACRAPMV2QS2LVYGD7H2MVE/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0007/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5587"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
