This will\nprotect us from file systems that have been corrupted and no longer have\nWRITTEN set on some of the blocks.\n\nThis was hit on a crafted image tweaking the WRITTEN bit and reported by\nKASAN as out-of-bound access in the eb accessors. The example is a dir\nitem at the end of an eb.\n\n  [2.042] BTRFS warning (device loop1): bad eb member start: ptr 0x3fff start 30572544 member offset 16410 size 2\n  [2.040] general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xe0009d1000000003: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN NOPTI\n  [2.537] KASAN: maybe wild-memory-access in range [0x0005088000000018-0x000508800000001f]\n  [2.729] CPU: 0 PID: 2587 Comm: mount Not tainted 6.8.2 #1\n  [2.729] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014\n  [2.621] RIP: 0010:btrfs_get_16+0x34b/0x6d0\n  [2.621] RSP: 0018:ffff88810871fab8 EFLAGS: 00000206\n  [2.621] RAX: 0000a11000000003 RBX: ffff888104ff8720 RCX: ffff88811b2288c0\n  [2.621] RDX: dffffc0000000000 RSI: ffffffff81dd8aca RDI: ffff88810871f748\n  [2.621] RBP: 000000000000401a R08: 0000000000000001 R09: ffffed10210e3ee9\n  [2.621] R10: ffff88810871f74f R11: 205d323430333737 R12: 000000000000001a\n  [2.621] R13: 000508800000001a R14: 1ffff110210e3f5d R15: ffffffff850011e8\n  [2.621] FS:  00007f56ea275840(0000) GS:ffff88811b200000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n  [2.621] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  [2.621] CR2: 00007febd13b75c0 CR3: 000000010bb50000 CR4: 00000000000006f0\n  [2.621] Call Trace:\n  [2.621]  <TASK>\n  [2.621]  ? show_regs+0x74/0x80\n  [2.621]  ? die_addr+0x46/0xc0\n  [2.621]  ? exc_general_protection+0x161/0x2a0\n  [2.621]  ? asm_exc_general_protection+0x26/0x30\n  [2.621]  ? btrfs_get_16+0x33a/0x6d0\n  [2.621]  ? btrfs_get_16+0x34b/0x6d0\n  [2.621]  ? btrfs_get_16+0x33a/0x6d0\n  [2.621]  ? __pfx_btrfs_get_16+0x10/0x10\n  [2.621]  ? __pfx_mutex_unlock+0x10/0x10\n  [2.621]  btrfs_match_dir_item_name+0x101/0x1a0\n  [2.621]  btrfs_lookup_dir_item+0x1f3/0x280\n  [2.621]  ? __pfx_btrfs_lookup_dir_item+0x10/0x10\n  [2.621]  btrfs_get_tree+0xd25/0x1910\n\n[ copy more details from report ]","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"85d8a826c7cde17f9cca9c4debecb4538bdb6573"},{"fixed":"9dff3e36ea89e8003516841c27c45af562b6ef44"},{"fixed":"ef3ba8ce8cf7075b716aa4afcefc3034215878ee"},{"fixed":"e03418abde871314e1a3a550f4c8afb7b89cb273"}]}],"versions":["v6.4","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.5","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.59","v6.6.6","v6.6.60","v6.6.61","v6.6.62","v6.6.63","v6.6.64","v6.6.65","v6.6.66","v6.6.67","v6.6.68","v6.6.69","v6.6.7","v6.6.70","v6.6.71","v6.6.72","v6.6.73","v6.6.74","v6.6.75","v6.6.76","v6.6.77","v6.6.78","v6.6.79","v6.6.8","v6.6.80","v6.6.81","v6.6.82","v6.6.83","v6.6.84","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.8.1","v6.8.2","v6.8.3","v6.8.4","v6.8.5","v6.8.6","v6.8.7","v6.8.8","v6.8.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-35949.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.5.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.85"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.8.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-35949.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9dff3e36ea89e8003516841c27c45af562b6ef44"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e03418abde871314e1a3a550f4c8afb7b89cb273"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ef3ba8ce8cf7075b716aa4afcefc3034215878ee"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/35xxx/CVE-2024-35949.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OTB4HWU2PTVW5NEYHHLOCXDKG3PYA534/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35949"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/35xxx/CVE-2024-35949.json"}}
