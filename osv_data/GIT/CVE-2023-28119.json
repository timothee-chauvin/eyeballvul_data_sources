Prior to version 0.4.13, the package's use of `flate.NewReader` does not limit the size of the input. The user can pass more than 1 MB of data in the HTTP request to the processing functions, which will be decompressed server-side using the Deflate algorithm. Therefore, after repeating the same request multiple times, it is possible to achieve a reliable crash since the operating system kills the process. This issue is patched in version 0.4.13.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/crewjam/saml","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8e9236867d176ad6338c870a84e2039aef8a5021"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.10","v0.4.11","v0.4.12","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.4.8","v0.4.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-28119.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/28xxx/CVE-2023-28119.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/crewjam/saml/commit/8e9236867d176ad6338c870a84e2039aef8a5021"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/crewjam/saml/security/advisories/GHSA-5mqj-xc49-246p"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28119"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/28xxx/CVE-2023-28119.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
