{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-46133","published":"2023-10-25T20:48:14Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:40:28.816615Z","aliases":["GHSA-mpj8-q39x-wq5h"],"summary":"crypto-es PBKDF2 1,000 times weaker than specified in 1993 and 1.3M times weaker than current standard","details":"CryptoES is a cryptography algorithms library compatible with ES6 and TypeScript. Prior to version 2.1.0, CryptoES PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993, and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current industry standard. This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005, and defaults to one single iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. Version 2.1.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure CryptoES to use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/entronad/crypto-es","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d506677fae3d03a454b37ad126e0c119d416b757"}]}],"versions":["1.0.2","1.1.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-46133.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/entronad/crypto-es/security/advisories/GHSA-mpj8-q39x-wq5h"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/entronad/crypto-es/commit/d506677fae3d03a454b37ad126e0c119d416b757"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-328","CWE-916"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
