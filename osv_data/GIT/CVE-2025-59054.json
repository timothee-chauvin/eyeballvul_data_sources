{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-59054","published":"2025-09-12T13:01:02.816Z","modified":"2025-11-30T05:16:26.903807Z","aliases":["GHSA-jxq2-hpw3-m5wf"],"summary":"dstack has insecure LUKS2 persistent storage partitions that may be opened and used","details":"dstack is a software development kit (SDK) to simplify the deployment of arbitrary containerized apps into trusted execution environments. In versions of dstack prior to 0.5.4, a malicious host may provide a crafted LUKS2 data volume to a dstack CVM for use as the `/data` mount. The guest will open the volume and write secret data using a volume key known to the attacker, causing disclosure of Wireguard keys and other secret information. The attacker can also pre-load data on the device, which could potentially compromise guest execution. LUKS2 volume metadata is not authenticated and supports null key-encryption algorithms, allowing an attacker to create a volume such that the volume opens (cryptsetup open) without error using any passphrase or token, records all writes in plaintext (or ciphertext with an attacker-known key), and/or contains arbitrary data chosen by the attacker. Version 0.5.4 of dstack contains a patch that addresses LUKS headers.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dstack-tee/dstack","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"fb75a412cb729889fc67683dd63fa84a212a1a52"}]}],"versions":["dev-v0.4.0.0","gateway-v0.5.3","kms-v0.5.3","kms-v0.5.4","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.4-beta","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59054.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/10/30/vulnerabilities-in-luks2-disk-encryption-for-confidential-vms/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/04de4e422bb06f075b4215b2cfc410f5d7ac7aed/dstack-util/src/system_setup.rs#L453-L456"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/commit/e36ad5f732d8821876a861934e1f47cda7b1a130"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/security/advisories/GHSA-jxq2-hpw3-m5wf"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/merge_requests/837"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-552"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
