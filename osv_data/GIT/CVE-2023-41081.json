As of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and all mappings must now be via explicit configuration. Only mod_jk is affected by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only): from 1.2.0 through 1.2.48.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49, which fixes the issue.\n\nHistory\n2023-09-13 Original advisory\n\n2023-09-28 Updated summary\n\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/tomcat-connectors","events":[{"introduced":"57f0a5b2de30a4000314a8e7b20a778ff7f1190e"},{"fixed":"3ad622409ae3335df9f353bef8ebc4d72a70fd6d"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-41081.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/rd1r26w7271jyqgzr4492tooyt583d8b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/28/7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00027.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/13/2"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
