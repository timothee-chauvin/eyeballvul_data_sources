For example, 512MB page cache on ARM64 when the base\npage size is 64KB can't be supported by xarray.  It leads to errors as the\nfollowing messages indicate when this sort of xarray entry is split.\n\nWARNING: CPU: 34 PID: 7578 at lib/xarray.c:1025 xas_split_alloc+0xf8/0x128\nModules linked in: binfmt_misc nft_fib_inet nft_fib_ipv4 nft_fib_ipv6   \\\nnft_fib nft_reject_inet nf_reject_ipv4 nf_reject_ipv6 nft_reject        \\\nnft_ct nft_chain_nat nf_nat nf_conntrack nf_defrag_ipv6 nf_defrag_ipv4  \\\nip_set rfkill nf_tables nfnetlink vfat fat virtio_balloon drm fuse xfs  \\\nlibcrc32c crct10dif_ce ghash_ce sha2_ce sha256_arm64 sha1_ce virtio_net \\\nnet_failover virtio_console virtio_blk failover dimlib virtio_mmio\nCPU: 34 PID: 7578 Comm: test Kdump: loaded Tainted: G W 6.10.0-rc5-gavin+ #9\nHardware name: QEMU KVM Virtual Machine, BIOS edk2-20240524-1.el9 05/24/2024\npstate: 83400005 (Nzcv daif +PAN -UAO +TCO +DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\npc : xas_split_alloc+0xf8/0x128\nlr : split_huge_page_to_list_to_order+0x1c4/0x720\nsp : ffff8000882af5f0\nx29: ffff8000882af5f0 x28: ffff8000882af650 x27: ffff8000882af768\nx26: 0000000000000cc0 x25: 000000000000000d x24: ffff00010625b858\nx23: ffff8000882af650 x22: ffffffdfc0900000 x21: 0000000000000000\nx20: 0000000000000000 x19: ffffffdfc0900000 x18: 0000000000000000\nx17: 0000000000000000 x16: 0000018000000000 x15: 52f8004000000000\nx14: 0000e00000000000 x13: 0000000000002000 x12: 0000000000000020\nx11: 52f8000000000000 x10: 52f8e1c0ffff6000 x9 : ffffbeb9619a681c\nx8 : 0000000000000003 x7 : 0000000000000000 x6 : ffff00010b02ddb0\nx5 : ffffbeb96395e378 x4 : 0000000000000000 x3 : 0000000000000cc0\nx2 : 000000000000000d x1 : 000000000000000c x0 : 0000000000000000\nCall trace:\n xas_split_alloc+0xf8/0x128\n split_huge_page_to_list_to_order+0x1c4/0x720\n truncate_inode_partial_folio+0xdc/0x160\n shmem_undo_range+0x2bc/0x6a8\n shmem_fallocate+0x134/0x430\n vfs_fallocate+0x124/0x2e8\n ksys_fallocate+0x4c/0xa0\n __arm64_sys_fallocate+0x24/0x38\n invoke_syscall.constprop.0+0x7c/0xd8\n do_el0_svc+0xb4/0xd0\n el0_svc+0x44/0x1d8\n el0t_64_sync_handler+0x134/0x150\n el0t_64_sync+0x17c/0x180\n\nFix it by disabling PMD-sized page cache when HPAGE_PMD_ORDER is larger\nthan MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER.
