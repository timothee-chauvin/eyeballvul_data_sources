Starting with version 10.0.0 and prior to version 12.1.0, Next.js is vulnerable to User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information. In order to be affected, the `next.config.js` file must have an `images.domains` array assigned and the image host assigned in `images.domains` must allow user-provided SVG. If the `next.config.js` file has `images.loader` assigned to something other than default, the instance is not affected. Version 12.1.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, change `next.config.js` to use a different `loader configuration` other than the default.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js","events":[{"introduced":"118ab7992bc8f7a7e5a7bb996510d9b56ffe4f68"},{"fixed":"8545fd1bb02244ced9e8dc9584a764aeae296cd0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23646.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/23xxx/CVE-2022-23646.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/34075"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v12.1.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-fmvm-x8mv-47mj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23646"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-451"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/23xxx/CVE-2022-23646.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
