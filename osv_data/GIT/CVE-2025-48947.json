{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-48947","published":"2025-06-04T20:14:44.369Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:34:11.505197Z","aliases":["GHSA-f3fg-mf2q-fj3f"],"summary":"NextJS-Auth0 SDK Vulnerable to CDN Caching of Session Cookies","details":"The Auth0 Next.js SDK is a library for implementing user authentication in Next.js applications. In Auth0 Next.js SDK versions 4.0.1 through 4.6.0, `__session` cookies set by auth0.middleware may be cached by CDNs due to missing Cache-Control headers. Three preconditions must be met in order for someone to be affected by the vulnerability: Applications using the NextJS-Auth0 SDK, versions between 4.0.1 to 4.6.0, applications using CDN or edge caching that caches responses with the Set-Cookie header, and if the Cache-Control header is not properly set for sensitive responses. Users should upgrade auth0/nextjs-auth0 to v4.6.1 to receive a patch.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0","events":[{"introduced":"715e995390f41bb702909b061056875c69577922"},{"fixed":"1f04fa3ce5410e774bf79a085c1570ece990f67b"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48947.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/security/advisories/GHSA-f3fg-mf2q-fj3f"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-525"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L"}]}
