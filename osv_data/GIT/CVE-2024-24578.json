{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-24578","published":"2024-03-18T21:13:03Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:40:04.572183Z","aliases":["GHSA-q967-q4j8-637h"],"summary":"RaspberryMatic Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability through HMServer File Upload ","details":"RaspberryMatic is an open-source operating system for HomeMatic internet-of-things devices. RaspberryMatic / OCCU prior to version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, caused by multiple issues within the Java based `HMIPServer.jar` component. RaspberryMatric includes a Java based `HMIPServer`, that can be accessed through URLs starting with `/pages/jpages`. The `FirmwareController` class does however not perform any session id checks, thus this feature can be accessed without a valid session. Due to this issue, attackers can gain remote code execution as root user, allowing a full system compromise. Version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a patch.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jens-maus/raspberrymatic","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9e2072a7686cb1d86449f400d519cff38ddd9648"}]}],"versions":["2.15.5.20151101","2.21.10.20160821","2.25.15.20161220","2.25.15.20170114","2.27.7.20170316","2.27.8.20170410","2.27.8.20170413","2.27.8.20170501","2.27.8.20170615","2.27.8.20170620","2.29.18.20170731","2.29.22.20170902","2.29.22.20171007","2.29.23.20171022","2.29.23.20171118","2.29.23.20171216","2.31.25.20180120","2.31.25.20180225","2.31.25.20180324","2.31.25.20180428","2.31.25.20180526","2.31.25.20180625","2.35.16.20180708","2.35.16.20180715","2.35.16.20180826","3.37.8.20180922","3.37.8.20180929","3.37.8.20181026","3.41.11.20181124","3.41.11.20181126","3.41.11.20181222","3.41.11.20190126","3.43.15.20190223","3.45.5.20190330","3.45.7.20190504","3.45.7.20190511","3.45.7.20190622","3.47.10.20190713","3.47.15.20190831","3.47.18.20190918","3.47.22.20191026","3.47.22.20191130","3.49.17.20191225","3.49.17.20200131","3.51.6.20200229","3.51.6.20200420","3.51.6.20200613","3.51.6.20200621","3.53.30.20200919","3.53.30.20201024","3.53.34.20201121","3.55.10.20210213","3.55.5.20201226","3.57.4.20210320","3.57.5.20210424","3.57.5.20210525","3.59.6.20210703","3.59.6.20210807","3.59.6.20210911","3.59.6.20211009","3.61.5.20211113","3.61.7.20211218","3.61.7.20220115","3.61.7.20220226","3.63.8.20220330","3.63.9.20220430","3.63.9.20220521","3.63.9.20220625","3.65.11.20221005","3.65.11.20221218","3.65.6.20220723","3.65.8.20220831","3.67.10.20230114","3.67.10.20230225","3.69.6.20230407","3.69.7.20230506","3.69.7.20230626","3.71.12.20230826","3.71.12.20231014","3.71.12.20231020","3.73.9.20231130","3.73.9.20240130","snapshots"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-24578.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/security/advisories/GHSA-q967-q4j8-637h"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-23","CWE-306"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
