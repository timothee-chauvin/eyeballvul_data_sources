NULL is passed to\n__cifs_sfu_make_node without checks, which passes it unchecked to\ncifs_strndup_to_utf16, which in turn passes it to\ncifs_local_to_utf16_bytes where '*from' is dereferenced, causing a crash.\n\nThis patch adds a check for NULL 'src' in cifs_strndup_to_utf16 and\nreturns NULL early to prevent dereferencing NULL pointer.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"41d3f256c6a5e41eb32b87168399c0facd512dc0"},{"fixed":"1f797f062b5cf13a1c2bcc23285361baaa7c9260"},{"fixed":"3c26a8d30ed6b53a52a023ec537dc50a6d34a67a"},{"fixed":"70bccd9855dae56942f2b18a08ba137bb54093a0"}]}],"versions":["v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.16.1","v6.16.2","v6.16.3","v6.16.4","v6.16.5","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39838.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.46"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39838.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1f797f062b5cf13a1c2bcc23285361baaa7c9260"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3c26a8d30ed6b53a52a023ec537dc50a6d34a67a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/70bccd9855dae56942f2b18a08ba137bb54093a0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/39xxx/CVE-2025-39838.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/10/msg00008.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39838"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/39xxx/CVE-2025-39838.json"}}
