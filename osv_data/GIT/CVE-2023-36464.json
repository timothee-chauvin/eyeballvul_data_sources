In affected versions an attacker may craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if `__parse_content_stream` is executed. That is, for example, the case if the user extracted text from such a PDF. This issue was introduced in pull request #969 and resolved in pull request #1828. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may modify the line `while peek not in (b\"\\r\", b\"\\n\")` in `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py` to `while peek not in (b\"\\r\", b\"\\n\", b\"\")`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0096c99031955b15bd30834e5566076d9528f59d"}]}],"versions":["1.26.0","1.27.0","1.27.1","1.27.10","1.27.11","1.27.12","1.27.2","1.27.3","1.27.4","1.27.5","1.27.6","1.27.7","1.27.8","1.27.9","1.28.0","1.28.1","1.28.2","2.0.0","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.10.0","2.10.1","2.10.2","2.10.3","2.10.4","2.10.5","2.10.6","2.10.7","2.10.8","2.10.9","2.11.0","2.11.1","2.11.2","2.12.0","2.12.1","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.5.0","2.6.0","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.9.0","3.0.0","3.1.0","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.3.0","3.4.0","3.4.1","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.5.2","3.6.0","3.7.0","3.7.1","3.8.0","3.8.1","v1.17","v1.18","v1.19","v1.20","v1.21","v1.22","v1.23","v1.24","v1.25","v1.25.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-36464.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/36xxx/CVE-2023-36464.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/1828"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/969"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvm-4w3v-6mr8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36464"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-835"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/36xxx/CVE-2023-36464.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
