{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-54117","published":"2025-12-24T13:06:38.311Z","modified":"2025-12-24T21:04:26.374827Z","summary":"s390/dcssblk: fix kernel crash with list_add corruption","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/dcssblk: fix kernel crash with list_add corruption\n\nCommit fb08a1908cb1 (\"dax: simplify the dax_device <-> gendisk\nassociation\") introduced new logic for gendisk association, requiring\ndrivers to explicitly call dax_add_host() and dax_remove_host().\n\nFor dcssblk driver, some dax_remove_host() calls were missing, e.g. in\ndevice remove path. The commit also broke error handling for out_dax case\nin device add path, resulting in an extra put_device() w/o the previous\nget_device() in that case.\n\nThis lead to stale xarray entries after device add / remove cycles. In the\ncase when a previously used struct gendisk pointer (xarray index) would be\nused again, because blk_alloc_disk() happened to return such a pointer, the\nxa_insert() in dax_add_host() would fail and go to out_dax, doing the extra\nput_device() in the error path. In combination with an already flawed error\nhandling in dcssblk (device_register() cleanup), which needs to be\naddressed in a separate patch, this resulted in a missing device_del() /\nklist_del(), and eventually in the kernel crash with list_add corruption on\na subsequent device_add() / klist_add().\n\nFix this by adding the missing dax_remove_host() calls, and also move the\nput_device() in the error path to restore the previous logic.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"fb08a1908cb119a4585611d91461ab6d27756b14"},{"fixed":"6489ec0107860345bc57dcde39e63dfb05ac5c11"},{"fixed":"b7ad75c77349beb4983b9f27108d9b3f33ae1413"},{"fixed":"b5c531a9a7d8e047c90c909f09cef06a9f8e62f4"},{"fixed":"c8f40a0bccefd613748d080147469a4652d6e74c"}]}],"versions":["v5.16","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.4.1","v6.4.10","v6.4.11","v6.4.12","v6.4.13","v6.4.14","v6.4.15","v6.4.2","v6.4.3","v6.4.4","v6.4.5","v6.4.6","v6.4.7","v6.4.8","v6.4.9","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.5.1","v6.5.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54117.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.53"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.16"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.5.0"},{"fixed":"6.5.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54117.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6489ec0107860345bc57dcde39e63dfb05ac5c11"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b5c531a9a7d8e047c90c909f09cef06a9f8e62f4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b7ad75c77349beb4983b9f27108d9b3f33ae1413"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c8f40a0bccefd613748d080147469a4652d6e74c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54117.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54117"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54117.json"}}
