When this happens the session object never gets destroyed. Eventually Asterisk can run out of memory and crash.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"85335355efb2d7914a1fe20ed31afcef15fd210c"},{"fixed":"b7607c41e4825490ffea9d09c0b3b8f9d65f87c0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-16672.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://downloads.digium.com/pub/security/AST-2017-011.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101765"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-27345"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201811-11"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-4076"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
