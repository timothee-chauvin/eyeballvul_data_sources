{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-46125","published":"2023-10-24T22:42:05Z","modified":"2025-10-21T19:32:34Z","aliases":["GHSA-rjxg-rpg3-9r89"],"summary":"Fides Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Config API Endpoint","details":"Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, serversâ€™ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.
