{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-30610","published":"2023-04-19T17:18:54Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:39:13.272173Z","aliases":["GHSA-mjv9-vp6w-3rc9"],"summary":"AWS SDK for Rust will log AWS credentials when TRACE-level logging is enabled for request sending","details":"aws-sigv4 is a rust library for low level request signing in the aws cloud platform. The `aws_sigv4::SigningParams` struct had a derived `Debug` implementation. When debug-formatted, it would include a user's AWS access key, AWS secret key, and security token in plaintext. When TRACE-level logging is enabled for an SDK, `SigningParams` is printed, thereby revealing those credentials to anyone with access to logs. All users of the AWS SDK for Rust who enabled TRACE-level logging, either globally (e.g. `RUST_LOG=trace`), or for the `aws-sigv4` crate specifically are affected. This issue has been addressed in a set of new releases. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable TRACE-level logging for AWS Rust SDK crates.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust","events":[{"introduced":"f2b4361b004ee822960ea9791f566fd4eb6d1aba"},{"fixed":"692703cef44b4f2fccae69fbd7576be1f4df9245"}]}],"versions":["v0.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-30610.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/security/advisories/GHSA-mjv9-vp6w-3rc9"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-532"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
