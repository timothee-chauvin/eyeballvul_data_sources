{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-21247","published":"2021-01-15T21:15:13.583Z","modified":"2025-11-20T11:32:23.785600Z","related":["GHSA-6pxf-75cf-vwjp"],"details":"OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, the application's BasePage registers an AJAX event listener (`AbstractPostAjaxBehavior`) in all pages other than the login page. This listener decodes and deserializes the `data` query parameter. We can access this listener by submitting a POST request to any page. This issue may lead to `post-auth RCE` This endpoint is subject to authentication and, therefore, requires a valid user to carry on the attack. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by encrypting serialization payload with secrets only known to server.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/theonedev/onedev","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4bd71941974a1b077e955616d7ba3da6fd21670c"}]}],"versions":["2.0-beta-build118","2.0-beta-build119","2.0-beta-build120","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","v3.0.10","v3.0.11","v3.0.12","v3.0.13","v3.0.14","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.0.8","v3.0.9","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.2","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.2.3","v3.2.4","v3.2.5","v3.2.6","v3.2.7","v3.2.8","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-21247.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/security/advisories/GHSA-6pxf-75cf-vwjp"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
