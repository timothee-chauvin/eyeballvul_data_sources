Versions of `tf2-item-format` since at least `4.2.6`  and prior to `5.9.14` are vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack when parsing crafted user input. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to perform DoS attacks on any service that uses any `tf2-item-format` to parse user input. Version `5.9.14` contains a fix for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/danocmx/node-tf2-item-format","events":[{"introduced":"2405955b2f618ee3aa6b13f53d1ffd7c753775ad"},{"fixed":"ce7417bc10e8c68e5d63209a73bca8b8c440aaea"}]}],"versions":["v4.2.6","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v4.3.4","v4.3.5","v5.0.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.4.0","v5.4.1","v5.4.2","v5.4.3","v5.5.0","v5.5.1","v5.5.2","v5.6.0","v5.6.1","v5.6.10","v5.6.11","v5.6.12","v5.6.13","v5.6.14","v5.6.15","v5.6.16","v5.6.17","v5.6.2","v5.6.3","v5.6.4","v5.6.5","v5.6.6","v5.6.7","v5.6.8","v5.7.0","v5.8.0","v5.8.1","v5.8.10","v5.8.2","v5.8.3","v5.8.4","v5.8.5","v5.8.6","v5.8.7","v5.8.8","v5.8.9","v5.9.0","v5.9.1","v5.9.10","v5.9.11","v5.9.12","v5.9.13","v5.9.2","v5.9.3","v5.9.4","v5.9.5","v5.9.6","v5.9.7","v5.9.8","v5.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-41655.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/41xxx/CVE-2024-41655.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/danocmx/node-tf2-item-format/commit/5cffcc16a9261d6a937bda72bfe6830e02e31eec"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/danocmx/node-tf2-item-format/releases/tag/v5.9.14"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/danocmx/node-tf2-item-format/security/advisories/GHSA-8h55-q5qq-p685"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41655"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-1333","CWE-624"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/41xxx/CVE-2024-41655.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
