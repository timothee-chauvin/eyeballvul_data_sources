In versions prior to 3.0.13, the \"Shared Notes\" feature contains a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability with the input location being the \"Username\" field and the output location on the \"Shared Notes\" page, when a user with a malicious username is editing content. This vulnerability allows a low-privileged user to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of higher-privileged users (e.g., Admins) who open the Shared Notes page. Version 3.0.13 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-pads","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"611795205c55e0a034d0d438efe7802a76aaee7f"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-55200.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2004667668f7bbb29aa235943275ee76226bad4d"}]}],"versions":["0.81-dev-deskshare-fixes-compatible-with-0.8","2.2-beta-10","2.2-beta-11","2.2-beta-12","2.2-beta-14","2.2-beta-15","2.2-beta-16","2.2-beta-17","2.2-beta-18","2.2-beta-19","2.2-beta-2","2.2-beta-20","2.2-beta-21","2.2-beta-22","2.2-beta-23","2.2-beta-3","2.2-beta-4","2.2-beta-5","2.2-beta-6","2.2-beta-7","2.2-beta-8","2.2-beta-9","2.2-rc-1","2.2-rc-2","2.2-rc-3","2.2-rc-4","2.2-rc-5","2.2-rc-6","2.4-rc-2","2.5.0-rc.3","3.0.0-rc.1","dcs-2-a","pre-recording-merge","v0.7","v0.71","v0.71a","v0.8","v0.81","v0.81b","v0.81rc","v0.81rc2","v0.81rc3","v0.81rc4","v0.81rc5","v0.8b4","v0.8b4.0","v0.8rc2","v0.9.0-beta","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v2.0-rc2","v2.0-rc3","v2.0-rc4","v2.0-rc5","v2.0-rc6","v2.0-rc7","v2.0.x-html5-beta1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.10","v2.2.11-good","v2.2.12","v2.2.14","v2.2.15","v2.2.16","v2.2.17","v2.2.18","v2.2.19","v2.2.2","v2.2.20","v2.2.21","v2.2.22","v2.2.23","v2.2.24","v2.2.25","v2.2.26","v2.2.27","v2.2.28","v2.2.29","v2.2.3","v2.2.30","v2.2.31","v2.2.32","v2.2.33","v2.2.34","v2.2.35","v2.2.36","v2.2.4","v2.2.5","v2.2.6","v2.2.7","v2.2.8","v2.2.9","v2.3-alpha-1","v2.3-alpha-2","v2.3-alpha-3","v2.3-alpha-4","v2.3-alpha-5","v2.3-alpha-6","v2.3-alpha-7","v2.3-alpha-8","v2.3-beta-1","v2.3-beta-2","v2.3-beta-3","v2.3-beta-4","v2.3-beta-5","v2.3-rc-1","v2.3-rc-2","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.10","v2.3.11","v2.3.12","v2.3.13","v2.3.14","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.7","v2.3.8","v2.3.9","v2.4-alpha-1","v2.4-alpha-2","v2.4-beta-1","v2.4-beta-2","v2.4-beta-3","v2.4-beta-4","v2.4-rc-1","v2.4-rc-3","v2.4-rc-4","v2.4-rc-5","v2.4-rc-6","v2.4-rc-7","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.5","v2.4.6","v2.5-alpha-1","v2.5-alpha-2","v2.5-alpha-3","v2.5-alpha-4","v2.5.0","v2.5.0-alpha.5","v2.5.0-alpha.6","v2.5.0-beta.1","v2.5.0-beta.2","v2.5.0-rc.1","v2.5.0-rc.2","v2.5.0-rc.4","v2.5.1","v2.5.10","v2.5.11","v2.5.2","v2.5.3","v2.5.4","v2.5.5","v2.5.6","v2.5.7","v2.5.8","v2.5.9","v2.6.0","v2.6.0-alpha.1","v2.6.0-alpha.2","v2.6.0-alpha.3","v2.6.0-alpha.4","v2.6.0-beta.1","v2.6.0-beta.2","v2.6.0-beta.3","v2.6.0-beta.4","v2.6.0-beta.5","v2.6.0-beta.6","v2.6.0-beta.7","v2.6.0-rc.1","v2.6.0-rc.2","v2.6.0-rc.3","v2.6.0-rc.4","v2.6.0-rc.5","v2.6.0-rc.6","v2.6.0-rc.7","v2.6.0-rc.8","v2.6.0-rc.9","v2.6.1","v2.6.10","v2.6.11","v2.6.12","v2.6.14","v2.6.2","v2.6.3","v2.6.4","v2.6.5","v2.6.6","v2.6.7","v2.6.8","v2.6.9","v2.7.0","v2.7.0-alpha.1","v2.7.0-alpha.2","v2.7.0-alpha.3","v2.7.0-beta.1","v2.7.0-beta.2","v2.7.0-beta.3","v2.7.0-rc.1","v2.7.0-rc.2","v2.7.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-alpha.1","v3.0.0-alpha.2","v3.0.0-alpha.3","v3.0.0-alpha.4","v3.0.0-alpha.6","v3.0.0-alpha.7","v3.0.0-beta.1","v3.0.0-beta.2","v3.0.0-beta.3","v3.0.0-beta.4","v3.0.0-beta.5","v3.0.0-beta.6","v3.0.0-beta.7","v3.0.0-rc.1","v3.0.0-rc.2","v3.0.0-rc.3","v3.0.0-rc.4","v3.0.1","v3.0.10","v3.0.11","v3.0.12","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.7","v3.0.8","v3.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-55200.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-pads/pull/67"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-pads/releases/tag/v1.5.4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/23693"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-9jv9-cjrm-grj2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
