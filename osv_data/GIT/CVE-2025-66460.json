Prior to 1.35.3, Lookyloo passed improperly escaped values to cells rendered in datatables using the orthogonal-data feature. It is definitely exploitable from the popup view, but it is most probably also exploitable in many other places. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.35.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lookyloo/lookyloo","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"841a5b5d263e024be242df3b6e5efca7a08016d7"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.35.3"}]}}],"versions":["v0.6","v1.0","v1.1","v1.10","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.17.0","v1.18.0","v1.19.0","v1.2","v1.20.0","v1.21.0","v1.22.0","v1.23.0","v1.24.0","v1.25.0","v1.26.0","v1.26.1","v1.27.0","v1.28.0","v1.28.1","v1.29.0","v1.3","v1.30.0","v1.31.0","v1.32.0","v1.33.0","v1.34.0","v1.35.0","v1.35.1","v1.35.2","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66460.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Lookyloo/lookyloo/commit/63b39311f6b251a671895d97174345faf1b18e6e"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Lookyloo/lookyloo/security/advisories/GHSA-r93r-7jfr-99c3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
