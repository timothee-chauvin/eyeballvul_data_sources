In Fleet before version 3.7.0 a malicious actor with a valid node key can send a badly formatted request that causes the Fleet server to exit, resulting in denial of service. This is possible only while a live query is currently ongoing. We believe the impact of this vulnerability to be low given the requirement that the actor has a valid node key. There is no information disclosure, privilege escalation, or code execution. The issue is fixed in Fleet 3.7.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f68f4238e83b45b2164e4ed05df14af0f06eaf40"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.0-rc1","1.0.0-rc2","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","2.0.0","2.0.0-rc1","2.0.0-rc2","2.0.0-rc3","2.0.0-rc4","2.0.0-rc5","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.5.0","2.6.0","3.0.0","3.1.0","3.2.0","3.3.0","3.4.0","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-21296.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/commit/f68f4238e83b45b2164e4ed05df14af0f06eaf40"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-xwh8-9p3f-3x45"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/fleetctl"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
