Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.' character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service). In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.\n\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nodejs/node","events":[{"introduced":"49a77a5a996a49e8cb728eed42e55a7c1a9eef6e"},{"fixed":"8c1dd95f3cc5d91acb9ce8994b3ac45ab927178f"}]}],"versions":["v18.0.0","v18.1.0","v18.10.0","v18.2.0","v18.3.0","v18.4.0","v18.5.0","v18.6.0","v18.7.0","v18.8.0","v18.9.0","v18.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-3786.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openssl/openssl","events":[{"introduced":"89cd17a031e022211684eb7eb41190cf1910f9fa"},{"fixed":"19cc035b6c6f2283573d29c7ea7f7d675cf750ce"}]}],"versions":["openssl-3.0.0","openssl-3.0.1","openssl-3.0.2","openssl-3.0.3","openssl-3.0.4","openssl-3.0.5","openssl-3.0.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-3786.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/794340"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=c42165b5706e42f67ef8ef4c351a9a4c5d21639a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20221101.txt"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00789.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
