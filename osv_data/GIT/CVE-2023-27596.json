{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-27596","published":"2023-03-15T20:09:14Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:12:31.257596Z","aliases":["GHSA-3ghx-j39m-cw4f"],"summary":"OpenSIPS has vulnerability in the codec_delete_XX() functions","details":"OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed SDP body is sent multiple times to an OpenSIPS configuration that makes use of the `stream_process` function. This issue was discovered during coverage guided fuzzing of the function `codec_delete_except_re`. By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash the server. It affects configurations containing functions that rely on the affected code, such as the function `codec_delete_except_re`. This issue has been fixed in version 3.1.8 and 3.2.5.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opensips/opensips","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"aa800179d5691116ccb1dd934cc0a65c7e98c85c"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.8"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opensips/opensips","events":[{"introduced":"1e94abe8837fe3511fada132d67a6385d8d099a2"},{"fixed":"7e284ab03dfcdc45752ebf66fcc430f01ee072b2"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.2.0"},{"fixed":"3.2.5"}]}}],"versions":["1.11.0","2.1-alpha1","2.1-alpha2","2.1-alpha3","2.1-rc1","3.1.0","3.1.0-beta","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.1.4","3.1.5","3.1.6","3.1.7","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.2.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-27596.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/dd051f8ed5ae3347fb1d556ced3c97822c9d8450"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-3ghx-j39m-cw4f"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
