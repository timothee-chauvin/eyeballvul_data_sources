Zip files uploaded to the server endpoint of `CodeChecker store` are not properly sanitized. An attacker, using a path traversal attack, can load and display files on the machine of `CodeChecker server`. The vulnerable endpoint is `/Default/v6.53/CodeCheckerService@massStoreRun`. The path traversal vulnerability allows reading data on the machine of the `CodeChecker server`, with the same permission level as the `CodeChecker server`.\nThe attack requires a user account on the `CodeChecker server`, with permission to store to a server, and view the stored report. This vulnerability has been patched in version 6.23.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ericsson/codechecker","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bea15d4fb77478860dee41f6e7f206050720869a"}]}],"versions":["v4.0","v5.0","v5.1","v5.10","v5.2","v5.3","v5.4","v5.5","v5.6","v5.7","v5.7.1","v5.8","v5.9","v6.0","v6.0.1","v6.1","v6.1.1","v6.10.0","v6.12.0","v6.13.0","v6.14.0","v6.15.0","v6.16.0","v6.17.0","v6.18.0","v6.19.0","v6.2","v6.2.1","v6.20.0","v6.21.0","v6.22.0","v6.23.0-rc1","v6.3","v6.4","v6.5","v6.5.1","v6.6.0","v6.7.0","v6.7.1","v6.8.0","v6.8.1","v6.9.0","v6.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-49793.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Ericsson/codechecker/commit/46bada41e32f3ba0f6011d5c556b579f6dddf07a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Ericsson/codechecker/security/advisories/GHSA-h26w-r4m5-8rrf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
