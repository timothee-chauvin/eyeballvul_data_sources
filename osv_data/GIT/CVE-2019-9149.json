{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2019-9149","published":"2019-07-09T21:15:11Z","modified":"2025-10-21T05:13:34.198905Z","details":"Mailvelope prior to 3.3.0 allows private key operations without user interaction via its client-API. By modifying an URL parameter in Mailvelope, an attacker is able to sign (and encrypt) arbitrary messages with Mailvelope, assuming the private key password is cached. A second vulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt an arbitrary message when the GnuPG backend is used in Mailvelope.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mailvelope/mailvelope","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6bcc22bd2864add171571ad0832ac9ecb5f293b5"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v0.10.0b1","v0.10.2","v0.12.0b1","v0.12.0b2","v0.12.0b3","v0.13.0","v0.13.0b1","v0.13.0b10","v0.13.0b11","v0.13.0b2","v0.13.0b3","v0.13.0b4","v0.13.0b5","v0.13.0b6","v0.13.0b7","v0.13.0b8","v0.13.0b9","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.7.0","v0.7.0b1","v0.7.0b2","v0.7.0b3","v0.8.0","v0.8.0b1","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.9.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.6","v1.4.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.6.5","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.1.0","v3.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-9149.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/mailvelope/mailvelope/blob/master/Changelog.md#v330"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/Studies/Mailvelope_Extensions/Mailvelope_Extensions_pdf.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/Studies/Mailvelope_Extensions/Mailvelope_Extensions_pdf.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
