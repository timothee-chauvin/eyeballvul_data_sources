{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-28243","published":"2024-03-25T19:40:00Z","modified":"2025-10-21T19:32:30Z","aliases":["GHSA-64fm-8hw2-v72w"],"summary":"KaTeX's maxExpand bypassed by \\edef","details":"KaTeX is a JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web. KaTeX users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter malicious input using `\\edef` that causes a near-infinite loop, despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. This can be used as an availability attack, where e.g. a client rendering another user's KaTeX input will be unable to use the site due to memory overflow, tying up the main thread, or stack overflow. Upgrade to KaTeX v0.16.10 to remove this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/katex/katex","events":[{"introduced":"8624d4ccffbf8543ec87e75b24ed9551a7c16714"},{"fixed":"ab323598fbf90a39c2c65bccd88f86b1ddfad931"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-28243.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/security/advisories/GHSA-64fm-8hw2-v72w"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/commit/e88b4c357f978b1bca8edfe3297f0aa309bcbe34"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-674"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
