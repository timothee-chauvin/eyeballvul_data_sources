Prior to version 2.4.1, the connection is not using TLS for communication. In the configuration of the irc connection, the software disables TLS, which makes all communication to Twitch IRC servers unencrypted. As a result, communication, including auth tokens, can be sniffed. Version 2.4.1 has a patch for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xithrius/twitch-tui","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"fd76ed44a4c864466f6e573626a65dd2c0acd9f0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-38688.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/38xxx/CVE-2023-38688.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Xithrius/twitch-tui/blob/340afc3c8c07a83289fe6ef614aa7563c8b70756/src/twitch/connection.rs#L23"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Xithrius/twitch-tui/commit/74d13ddca35f8f0816f4933c229da1fd95c0350a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Xithrius/twitch-tui/security/advisories/GHSA-779w-xvpm-78jx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38688"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-311"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/38xxx/CVE-2023-38688.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
