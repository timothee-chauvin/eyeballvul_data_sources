{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-31133","published":"2022-07-07T17:45:12Z","modified":"2025-12-04T10:24:25.920360Z","aliases":["GHSA-p7h3-73v7-959c"],"summary":"Cross site scripting in HumHub","details":"HumHub is an Open Source Enterprise Social Network. Affected versions of HumHub are vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, the attacker would need a permission to administer the Spaces feature. The names of individual \"spaces\" are not properly escaped and so an attacker with sufficient privilege could insert malicious javascript into a space name and exploit system users who visit that space. It is recommended that the HumHub is upgraded to 1.11.4, 1.10.5. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/humhub/humhub","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"44d4ecb16fac1e2b50fc85a5751067e0e23e1e94"}]}],"versions":["v.0.8.2","v0.10.0","v0.10.0-rc.1","v0.10.1","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.11.2","v0.20.0","v0.20.0-beta.1","v0.20.0-beta.2","v0.20.1","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.9.0","v0.9.0-rc.1","v0.9.0-rc.2","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-beta.1","v1.0.0-beta.2","v1.0.0-beta.3","v1.0.0-beta.4","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-beta.1","v1.1.0-beta.2","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.10.0","v1.10.0-beta.1","v1.10.0-beta.2","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.11.0","v1.11.0-beta.2","v1.11.0-beta.3","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-beta.1","v1.2.0-beta.2","v1.2.0-beta.3","v1.2.0-beta.4","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-beta.1","v1.3.0-beta.2","v1.3.0-beta.3","v1.3.1","v1.3.10","v1.3.11","v1.3.12","v1.3.13","v1.3.14","v1.3.15","v1.3.16","v1.3.17","v1.3.18","v1.3.19","v1.3.2","v1.3.20","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v1.4.0","v1.4.0-beta.1","v1.4.0-beta.2","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-beta.1","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-beta.1","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-beta.1","v1.7.0-beta.2","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.8.0","v1.8.0-beta.1","v1.8.0-beta.2","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-beta.1","v1.9.0-beta.2","v1.9.1","v1.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31133.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/31xxx/CVE-2022-31133.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/humhub/humhub/commit/07d9f8f9b6334970ee38156a3416c3708d157cae"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/humhub/humhub/commit/f88991dfe56a05870df165ac89a2755dd4c1ffa1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/humhub/humhub/security/advisories/GHSA-p7h3-73v7-959c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://huntr.dev/bounties/89d996a2-de30-4261-8e3f-98e54cb25f76"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31133"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/31xxx/CVE-2022-31133.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
