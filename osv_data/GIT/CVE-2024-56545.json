Normally, devres_open_group() is called from\n__hid_device_probe() but Hyper-V HID driver overrides 'hid_dev->driver'\nwith 'mousevsc_hid_driver' stub and basically re-implements\n__hid_device_probe() by calling hid_parse() and hid_hw_start() but not\ndevres_open_group(). hid_device_probe() does not call __hid_device_probe()\nfor it. Later, when the driver is removed, hid_device_remove() calls\ndevres_release_group() as it doesn't check whether hdev->driver was\ninitially overridden or not.\n\nThe issue seems to be related to the commit 62c68e7cee33 (\"HID: ensure\ntimely release of driver-allocated resources\") but the commit itself seems\nto be correct.\n\nFix the issue by dropping the 'hid_dev->driver' override and using\nhid_register_driver()/hid_unregister_driver() instead. Alternatively, it\nwould have been possible to rely on the default handling but\nHID_CONNECT_DEFAULT implies HID_CONNECT_HIDRAW and it doesn't seem to work\nfor mousevsc as-is.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"62c68e7cee332e08e625af3bca3318814086490d"},{"fixed":"b03e713a400aeb5f969bab4daf47a7402d0df814"},{"fixed":"19a9457e5e210e408c1f8865b5d93c5a2c90409d"},{"fixed":"3d48d0fbaaa74a04fb9092780a3f83dc4f3f8160"},{"fixed":"66ef47faa90d838cda131fe1f7776456cc3b59f2"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.11.1","v6.11.10","v6.11.2","v6.11.3","v6.11.4","v6.11.5","v6.11.6","v6.11.7","v6.11.8","v6.11.9","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.5","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.59","v6.6.6","v6.6.60","v6.6.61","v6.6.62","v6.6.63","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-56545.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.5.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.64"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.11.11"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-56545.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/19a9457e5e210e408c1f8865b5d93c5a2c90409d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3d48d0fbaaa74a04fb9092780a3f83dc4f3f8160"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/66ef47faa90d838cda131fe1f7776456cc3b59f2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b03e713a400aeb5f969bab4daf47a7402d0df814"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/56xxx/CVE-2024-56545.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56545"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/56xxx/CVE-2024-56545.json"}}
