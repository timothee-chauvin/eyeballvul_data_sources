If we ignore\nct->status and pretend its 0, the entry matches those that are newly\nallocated but not yet inserted into the hash:\n  - ct hlist pointers are overloaded and store/cache the raw tuple hash\n  - ct->timeout matches the relative time expected for a new udp flow\n    rather than the absolute 'jiffies' value.\n\nIf it were not for the presence of IPS_CONFIRMED,\n__nf_conntrack_find_get() would have skipped the entry.\n\nTheory is that we did hit following race:\n\ncpu x \t\t\tcpu y\t\t\tcpu z\n found entry E\t\tfound entry E\n E is expired\t\t<preemption>\n nf_ct_delete()\n return E to rcu slab\n\t\t\t\t\tinit_conntrack\n\t\t\t\t\tE is re-inited,\n\t\t\t\t\tct->status set to 0\n\t\t\t\t\treply tuplehash hnnode.pprev\n\t\t\t\t\tstores hash value.\n\ncpu y found E right before it was deleted on cpu x.\nE is now re-inited on cpu z.  cpu y was preempted before\nchecking for expiry and/or confirm bit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t->refcnt set to 1\n\t\t\t\t\tE now owned by skb\n\t\t\t\t\t->timeout set to 30000\n\nIf cpu y were to resume now, it would observe E as\nexpired but would skip E due to missing CONFIRMED bit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tnf_conntrack_confirm gets called\n\t\t\t\t\tsets: ct->status |= CONFIRMED\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is wrong: E is not yet added\n\t\t\t\t\tto hashtable.\n\ncpu y resumes, it observes E as expired but CONFIRMED:\n\t\t\t<resumes>\n\t\t\tnf_ct_expired()\n\t\t\t -> yes (ct->timeout is 30s)\n\t\t\tconfirmed bit set.\n\ncpu y will try to delete E from the hashtable:\n\t\t\tnf_ct_delete() -> set DYING bit\n\t\t\t__nf_ct_delete_from_lists\n\nEven this scenario doesn't guarantee a crash:\ncpu z still holds the table bucket lock(s) so y blocks:\n\n\t\t\twait for spinlock held by z\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCONFIRMED is set but there is no\n\t\t\t\t\tguarantee ct will be added to hash:\n\t\t\t\t\t\"chaintoolong\" or \"clash resolution\"\n\t\t\t\t\tlogic both skip the insert step.\n\t\t\t\t\treply hnnode.pprev still stores the\n\t\t\t\t\thash value.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tunlocks spinlock\n\t\t\t\t\treturn NF_DROP\n\t\t\t<unblocks, then\n\t\t\t crashes on hlist_nulls_del_rcu pprev>\n\nIn case CPU z does insert the entry into the hashtable, cpu y will unlink\nE again right away but no crash occurs.\n\nWithout 'cpu y' race, 'garbage' hlist is of no consequence:\nct refcnt remains at 1, eventually skb will be free'd and E gets\ndestroyed via: nf_conntrack_put -> nf_conntrack_destroy -> nf_ct_destroy.\n\nTo resolve this, move the IPS_CONFIRMED assignment after the table\ninsertion but before the unlock.\n\nPablo points out that the confirm-bit-store could be reordered to happen\nbefore hlist add resp. the timeout fixup, so switch to set_bit and\nbefore_atomic memory barrier to prevent this.\n\nIt doesn't matter if other CPUs can observe a newly inserted entry right\nbefore the CONFIRMED bit was set:\n\nSuch event cannot be distinguished from above \"E is the old incarnation\"\ncase: the entry will be skipped.\n\nAlso change nf_ct_should_gc() to first check the confirmed bit.\n\nThe gc sequence is:\n 1. Check if entry has expired, if not skip to next entry\n 2. Obtain a reference to the expired entry.\n 3. Call nf_ct_should_gc() to double-check step 1.\n\nnf_ct_should_gc() is thus called only for entries that already failed an\nexpiry check.
