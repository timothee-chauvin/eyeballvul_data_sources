{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-53106","published":"2025-07-02T13:28:08Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:46:50.467096Z","aliases":["GHSA-3m86-c9x3-vwm9"],"summary":"Graylog vulnerable to privilege escalation through API tokens","details":"Graylog is a free and open log management platform. In versions 6.2.0 to before 6.2.4 and 6.3.0-alpha.1 to before 6.3.0-rc.2, Graylog users can gain elevated privileges by creating and using API tokens for the local Administrator or any other user for whom the malicious user knows the ID. For the attack to succeed, the attacker needs a user account in Graylog. They can then proceed to issue hand-crafted requests to the Graylog REST API and exploit a weak permission check for token creation. This issue has been patched in versions 6.2.4 and 6.3.0-rc.2. A workaround involves disabling the respective configuration found in System > Configuration > Users > \"Allow users to create personal access tokens\".","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/graylog2/graylog2-server","events":[{"introduced":"f35438d187e32050ff4d51e4fb93a70341982ceb"},{"fixed":"a78fb0509479a3717340c08b017473f871dc99f7"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/graylog2/graylog2-server","events":[{"introduced":"7859409af6e715a6be87a553d7acdfa310c14dd6"},{"fixed":"381b7a89f8904a6aad8b22b2c4dfc0e448281188"}]}],"versions":["6.2.0","6.2.1","6.2.2","6.2.3","6.3.0-alpha.1","6.3.0-alpha.2","6.3.0-alpha.3","6.3.0-alpha.4","6.3.0-beta.1","6.3.0-beta.2","6.3.0-beta.3","6.3.0-beta.4","6.3.0-beta.5","6.3.0-rc.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53106.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/security/advisories/GHSA-3m86-c9x3-vwm9"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/commit/6936bd16a783c2944a3d2f1e83902062520f90e3"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/commit/9215b8f1fd32566c31e6f7447ed864df3590c157"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-285"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H"}]}
