The q URL parameter allows a user to filter users by any column, and filter password=~ could be abused to leak out a user's password hash character by character. An attacker with administrator access could exploit this to leak highly sensitive information stored in the Harbor database. All endpoints that support the q URL parameter are vulnerable to this ORM leak attack.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/goharbor/harbor","events":[{"introduced":"db1569ae20cc4bc1e57f94d72c955b04db8deeb6"},{"fixed":"9384ed0e47b0741425dd3d2aa23f1e0ab262eaf4"}]}],"versions":["v2.13.0","v2.13.0-rc2","v2.13.1-rc1","v2.13.1-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-30086.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/security/advisories/GHSA-h27m-3qw8-3pw8"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://goharbor.io/blog/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://www.elttam.com/blog/plormbing-your-django-orm/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
