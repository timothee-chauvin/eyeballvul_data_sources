Otherwise,\nthe kernel warning with callstack is printed out to dmesg.\n\nExample failing scenario:\n 1. Load the i40e driver.\n 2. Load the XDP program.\n 3. Unload the i40e driver (using \"rmmod\" command).\n\nThe example kernel warning log:\n\n[  +0.004646] WARNING: CPU: 94 PID: 10395 at net/core/dev.c:9290
