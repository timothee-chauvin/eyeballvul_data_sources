This flaw is strictly related to CVE-2018-13405. A local guest user can create files in the directories shared by virtio-fs with unintended group ownership in a scenario where a directory is SGID to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of the group. This could allow a malicious unprivileged user inside the guest to gain access to resources accessible to the root group, potentially escalating their privileges within the guest. A malicious local user in the host might also leverage this unexpected executable file created by the guest to escalate their privileges on the host system.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"449e8171f96a6a944d1f3b7d3627ae059eae21ca"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.11.0-rc0","v0.12.0-rc0","v0.13.0-rc0","v0.14.0-rc0","v0.15.0-rc0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.5.0","v1.0","v1.0-rc0","v1.0-rc1","v1.0-rc2","v1.0-rc3","v1.0-rc4","v1.1-rc0","v1.1-rc1","v1.1-rc2","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc2","v1.1.0-rc3","v1.1.0-rc4","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc0","v1.2.0-rc1","v1.2.0-rc2","v1.2.0-rc3","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-rc0","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.3.0-rc2","v1.4.0","v1.4.0-rc0","v1.4.0-rc1","v1.4.0-rc2","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-rc0","v1.5.0-rc1","v1.5.0-rc2","v1.5.0-rc3","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc0","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.6.0-rc2","v1.6.0-rc3","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.7.0-rc2","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-rc0","v2.0.0-rc1","v2.0.0-rc2","v2.0.0-rc3","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-rc0","v2.1.0-rc1","v2.1.0-rc2","v2.1.0-rc3","v2.1.0-rc4","v2.1.0-rc5","v2.10.0","v2.10.0-rc0","v2.10.0-rc1","v2.10.0-rc2","v2.10.0-rc3","v2.10.0-rc4","v2.11.0","v2.11.0-rc0","v2.11.0-rc1","v2.11.0-rc2","v2.11.0-rc3","v2.11.0-rc4","v2.11.0-rc5","v2.12.0","v2.12.0-rc0","v2.12.0-rc1","v2.12.0-rc2","v2.12.0-rc3","v2.12.0-rc4","v2.2.0","v2.2.0-rc0","v2.2.0-rc1","v2.2.0-rc2","v2.2.0-rc3","v2.2.0-rc4","v2.2.0-rc5","v2.3.0","v2.3.0-rc0","v2.3.0-rc1","v2.3.0-rc2","v2.3.0-rc3","v2.3.0-rc4","v2.4.0","v2.4.0-rc0","v2.4.0-rc1","v2.4.0-rc2","v2.4.0-rc3","v2.4.0-rc4","v2.5.0","v2.5.0-rc0","v2.5.0-rc1","v2.5.0-rc2","v2.5.0-rc3","v2.5.0-rc4","v2.6.0","v2.6.0-rc0","v2.6.0-rc1","v2.6.0-rc2","v2.6.0-rc3","v2.6.0-rc4","v2.6.0-rc5","v2.7.0","v2.7.0-rc0","v2.7.0-rc1","v2.7.0-rc2","v2.7.0-rc3","v2.7.0-rc4","v2.7.0-rc5","v2.8.0","v2.8.0-rc0","v2.8.0-rc1","v2.8.0-rc2","v2.8.0-rc3","v2.8.0-rc4","v2.9.0","v2.9.0-rc0","v2.9.0-rc1","v2.9.0-rc2","v2.9.0-rc3","v2.9.0-rc4","v2.9.0-rc5","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-rc0","v3.0.0-rc1","v3.0.0-rc2","v3.0.0-rc3","v3.0.0-rc4","v3.1.0","v3.1.0-rc0","v3.1.0-rc1","v3.1.0-rc2","v3.1.0-rc3","v3.1.0-rc4","v3.1.0-rc5","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-rc0","v4.0.0-rc1","v4.0.0-rc2","v4.0.0-rc3","v4.0.0-rc4","v4.1.0","v4.1.0-rc0","v4.1.0-rc1","v4.1.0-rc2","v4.1.0-rc3","v4.1.0-rc4","v4.1.0-rc5","v4.2.0","v4.2.0-rc0","v4.2.0-rc1","v4.2.0-rc2","v4.2.0-rc3","v4.2.0-rc4","v4.2.0-rc5","v5.0.0","v5.0.0-rc0","v5.0.0-rc1","v5.0.0-rc2","v5.0.0-rc3","v5.0.0-rc4","v5.1.0","v5.1.0-rc0","v5.1.0-rc1","v5.1.0-rc2","v5.1.0-rc3","v5.2.0","v5.2.0-rc0","v5.2.0-rc1","v5.2.0-rc2","v5.2.0-rc3","v5.2.0-rc4","v6.0.0","v6.0.0-rc0","v6.0.0-rc1","v6.0.0-rc2","v6.0.0-rc3","v6.0.0-rc4","v6.0.0-rc5","v6.1.0","v6.1.0-rc0","v6.1.0-rc1","v6.1.0-rc2","v6.1.0-rc3","v6.1.0-rc4","v6.2.0","v6.2.0-rc0","v6.2.0-rc1","v6.2.0-rc3","v6.2.0-rc4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-0358.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["302744531140615624852398485415115787939","79488242875555874406244692487447543669","54993752283591408625803543982954136445","296848869420297648612894062423751011378","321190977610121332206507786484912906120","96468402481531211804829970676617099666","162131700049634049016222100105217357312","60882616724414873124283531094951134433","167377636730820718430661922098317479089","277010097093721354642499543200327550277"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2022-0358-7e50f8d8","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu@449e8171f96a6a944d1f3b7d3627ae059eae21ca","target":{"file":"tools/virtiofsd/passthrough_ll.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"263390199775715885756993363120077698073","length":3513},"id":"CVE-2022-0358-f06ac984","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu@449e8171f96a6a944d1f3b7d3627ae059eae21ca","target":{"file":"tools/virtiofsd/passthrough_ll.c","function":"main"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-0358"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2044863"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/449e8171f96a6a944d1f3b7d3627ae059eae21ca"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221007-0008/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
