When Squid is configured to use Digest authentication, it parses the header Proxy-Authorization. It searches for certain tokens such as domain, uri, and qop. Squid checks if this token's value starts with a quote and ends with one. If so, it performs a memcpy of its length minus 2. Squid never checks whether the value is just a single quote (which would satisfy its requirements), leading to a memcpy of its length minus 1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/squid-cache/squid","events":[{"last_affected":"2e17b02616d37206ba9cccc53c20667624fbef9f"},{"introduced":"83f1f03412750fdd98b5219ff5829cd4e319a1b3"},{"last_affected":"6cfeb300caf423ff49a0511d8bd43a56f3418273"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-12525.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-11/msg00053.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-11/msg00056.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/squid-4-7f73e9c5d17664b882ed32590e6af310c247f320.patch"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commits/v4"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/07/msg00018.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/07/msg00009.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Aug/42"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4065-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4065-2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4507"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SPXN2CLAGN5QSQBTOV5IGVLDOQSRFNTZ/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
