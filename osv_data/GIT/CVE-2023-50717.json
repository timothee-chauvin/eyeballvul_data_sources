  "details": "NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. Starting in verson 0.202.6 and prior to version 0.202.10, an attacker can upload a html file with malicious content. If user tries to open that file in browser malicious scripts can be executed leading  stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows remote attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of the user accessing the vector. An attacker could have used this vulnerability to execute requests in the name of a logged-in user or potentially collect information about the attacked user by displaying a malicious form. Version 0.202.10 contains a patch for the issue.\n",
