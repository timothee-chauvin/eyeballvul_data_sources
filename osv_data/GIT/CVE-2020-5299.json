{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2020-5299","published":"2020-06-03T22:15:11.957Z","modified":"2025-11-20T11:29:14.244538Z","aliases":["GHSA-4rhm-m2fp-hx7q"],"related":["GHSA-4rhm-m2fp-hx7q"],"details":"In OctoberCMS (october/october composer package) versions from 1.0.319 and before 1.0.466, any users with the ability to modify any data that could eventually be exported as a CSV file from the `ImportExportController` could potentially introduce a CSV injection into the data to cause the generated CSV export file to be malicious. This requires attackers to achieve the following before a successful attack can be completed: 1. Have found a vulnerability in the victims spreadsheet software of choice. 2. Control data that would potentially be exported through the `ImportExportController` by a theoretical victim. 3. Convince the victim to export above data as a CSV and run it in vulnerable spreadsheet software while also bypassing any sanity checks by said software. Issue has been patched in Build 466 (v1.0.466).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/octobercms/library","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c84bf03f506052c848f2fddc05f24be631427a1a"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.319","v1.0.320","v1.0.321","v1.0.322","v1.0.323","v1.0.324","v1.0.325","v1.0.326","v1.0.327","v1.0.328","v1.0.329","v1.0.330","v1.0.331","v1.0.332","v1.0.333","v1.0.334","v1.0.335","v1.0.336","v1.0.337","v1.0.338","v1.0.339","v1.0.340","v1.0.341","v1.0.342","v1.0.343","v1.0.344","v1.0.345","v1.0.346","v1.0.347","v1.0.348","v1.0.349","v1.0.350","v1.0.351","v1.0.352","v1.0.353","v1.0.354","v1.0.355","v1.0.356","v1.0.357","v1.0.358","v1.0.359","v1.0.360","v1.0.361","v1.0.362","v1.0.363","v1.0.364","v1.0.365","v1.0.366","v1.0.367","v1.0.368","v1.0.369","v1.0.370","v1.0.371","v1.0.372","v1.0.373","v1.0.374","v1.0.375","v1.0.376","v1.0.377","v1.0.378","v1.0.379","v1.0.380","v1.0.381","v1.0.382","v1.0.383","v1.0.384","v1.0.385","v1.0.386","v1.0.387","v1.0.388","v1.0.389","v1.0.390","v1.0.391","v1.0.392","v1.0.393","v1.0.394","v1.0.395","v1.0.396","v1.0.397","v1.0.398","v1.0.399","v1.0.400","v1.0.401","v1.0.402","v1.0.403","v1.0.404","v1.0.405","v1.0.406","v1.0.407","v1.0.408","v1.0.409","v1.0.410","v1.0.411","v1.0.412","v1.0.413","v1.0.414","v1.0.415","v1.0.416","v1.0.417","v1.0.418","v1.0.419","v1.0.420","v1.0.421","v1.0.422","v1.0.423","v1.0.424","v1.0.425","v1.0.426","v1.0.427","v1.0.428","v1.0.429","v1.0.430","v1.0.431","v1.0.432","v1.0.433","v1.0.434","v1.0.435","v1.0.436","v1.0.437","v1.0.438","v1.0.439","v1.0.440","v1.0.441","v1.0.442","v1.0.443","v1.0.444","v1.0.445","v1.0.446","v1.0.447","v1.0.448","v1.0.449","v1.0.450","v1.0.451","v1.0.452","v1.0.453","v1.0.454","v1.0.455","v1.0.456","v1.0.457","v1.0.458","v1.0.459","v1.0.460","v1.0.461","v1.0.462","v1.0.463","v1.0.464","v1.0.465"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-5299.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/octobercms/october","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"802d8c8e09a2b342649393edb6d3ceb958851484"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.319","v1.0.320","v1.0.321","v1.0.322","v1.0.323","v1.0.324","v1.0.325","v1.0.326","v1.0.327","v1.0.328","v1.0.329","v1.0.330","v1.0.331","v1.0.332","v1.0.333","v1.0.334","v1.0.335","v1.0.336","v1.0.337","v1.0.338","v1.0.339","v1.0.340","v1.0.341","v1.0.342","v1.0.343","v1.0.344","v1.0.345","v1.0.346","v1.0.347","v1.0.348","v1.0.349","v1.0.350","v1.0.351","v1.0.352","v1.0.353","v1.0.354","v1.0.355","v1.0.356","v1.0.357","v1.0.358","v1.0.359","v1.0.360","v1.0.361","v1.0.362","v1.0.363","v1.0.364","v1.0.365","v1.0.366","v1.0.367","v1.0.368","v1.0.369","v1.0.370","v1.0.371","v1.0.372","v1.0.373","v1.0.374","v1.0.375","v1.0.376","v1.0.377","v1.0.378","v1.0.379","v1.0.380","v1.0.381","v1.0.382","v1.0.383","v1.0.384","v1.0.385","v1.0.386","v1.0.387","v1.0.388","v1.0.389","v1.0.390","v1.0.391","v1.0.392","v1.0.393","v1.0.394","v1.0.395","v1.0.396","v1.0.397","v1.0.398","v1.0.399","v1.0.400","v1.0.401","v1.0.402","v1.0.403","v1.0.404","v1.0.405","v1.0.406","v1.0.407","v1.0.408","v1.0.409","v1.0.410","v1.0.411","v1.0.412","v1.0.413","v1.0.414","v1.0.415","v1.0.416","v1.0.417","v1.0.418","v1.0.419","v1.0.420","v1.0.421","v1.0.422","v1.0.423","v1.0.424","v1.0.425","v1.0.426","v1.0.427","v1.0.428","v1.0.429","v1.0.430","v1.0.431","v1.0.432","v1.0.433","v1.0.434","v1.0.435","v1.0.436","v1.0.437","v1.0.438","v1.0.439","v1.0.440","v1.0.441","v1.0.442","v1.0.443","v1.0.444","v1.0.445","v1.0.446","v1.0.447","v1.0.448","v1.0.449","v1.0.450","v1.0.451","v1.0.452","v1.0.453","v1.0.454","v1.0.455","v1.0.456","v1.0.457","v1.0.458","v1.0.459","v1.0.460","v1.0.461","v1.0.462","v1.0.463","v1.0.464"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-5299.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/158730/October-CMS-Build-465-XSS-File-Read-File-Deletion-CSV-Injection.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Aug/2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c84bf03f506052c848f2fddc05f24be631427a1a"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/802d8c8e09a2b342649393edb6d3ceb958851484"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-4rhm-m2fp-hx7q"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
