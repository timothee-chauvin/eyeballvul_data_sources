This is a configuration vulnerability affecting nginx-defender deployments. Example configuration files\nconfig.yaml and docker-compose.yml contain default credentials (default_password: \"change_me_please\", GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123). If users deploy nginx-defender without changing these defaults, attackers with network access could gain administrative control, bypassing security protections. The issue is addressed in v1.5.0 and later.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/anipaleja/nginx-defender","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ed5acf37631f903212791f5c89cddf986b0ea86b"}]}],"versions":["v1.4.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-55740.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Anipaleja/nginx-defender/security/advisories/GHSA-pr72-8fxw-xx22"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1392"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
