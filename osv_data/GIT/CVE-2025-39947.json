However, the netdevice can\nbe removed and its pointer cleared when unbound from the mlx5_core.eth\ndriver. This results in a NULL pointer, causing a kernel panic.\n\n BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000000001300\n at RIP: 0010:mlx5e_vport_rep_load+0x22a/0x270 [mlx5_core]\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  mlx5_esw_offloads_rep_load+0x68/0xe0 [mlx5_core]\n  esw_offloads_enable+0x593/0x910 [mlx5_core]\n  mlx5_eswitch_enable_locked+0x341/0x420 [mlx5_core]\n  mlx5_devlink_eswitch_mode_set+0x17e/0x3a0 [mlx5_core]\n  devlink_nl_eswitch_set_doit+0x60/0xd0\n  genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0xe0/0x130\n  genl_rcv_msg+0x183/0x290\n  netlink_rcv_skb+0x4b/0xf0\n  genl_rcv+0x24/0x40\n  netlink_unicast+0x255/0x380\n  netlink_sendmsg+0x1f3/0x420\n  __sock_sendmsg+0x38/0x60\n  __sys_sendto+0x119/0x180\n  do_syscall_64+0x53/0x1d0\n  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n\nEnsure the pointer is valid before use by checking it for NULL.
