switch","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: gadget: Fix use-after-free during usb config switch\n\nIn the process of switching USB config from rndis to other config,\nif the hardware does not support the ->pullup callback, or the\nhardware encounters a low probability fault, both of them may cause\nthe ->pullup callback to fail, which will then cause a system panic\n(use after free).\n\nThe gadget drivers sometimes need to be unloaded regardless of the\nhardware's behavior.\n\nAnalysis as
