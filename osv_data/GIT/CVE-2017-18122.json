Attributes contained in all the assertions received will be merged and the entityID of the first assertion received will be used, allowing an attacker to impersonate any user of any IdP given an assertion signed by the targeted IdP.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"9ebbbbc7fa334d55526c2a5e230d9941002cdcb8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-18122.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/02/msg00008.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://simplesamlphp.org/security/201710-01"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4127"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
