A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.3.6 affects the endpoint `/certificate.crt` and the way the web interface of the ArduinoCreateAgent handles custom error messages. An attacker that is able to persuade a victim into clicking on a malicious link can perform a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack on the web interface of the create agent, which would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary browser client side code. Version 1.3.6 contains a fix for the issue.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e52bb0070110665b1c0bb29876b183a7c068e254"}]}],"versions":["1.1.251","1.1.60","1.2.0-rc1","1.2.5-rc2","1.2.7","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.3-rc3","1.3.4","1.3.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-49296.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent/security/advisories/GHSA-j5hc-wx84-844h"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent/commit/9a0e582bb8a1ff8e70d202943ddef8625ccefcc8"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
