{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-11137","published":"2025-03-20T10:15:23Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:34:21Z","details":"An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `PATCH /v1/runs/:id/score` endpoint of lunary-ai/lunary version 1.6.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to update the score data of any run by manipulating the id parameter in the request URL, which corresponds to the `runId_score` in the database. The endpoint does not sufficiently validate whether the authenticated user has permission to modify the specified runId, enabling an attacker with a valid account to modify other users' runId scores by specifying different id values. This issue was fixed in version 1.6.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ded72a95c220904a151d27daf3c67e8644e386c6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-11137.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/0a399d86-0105-4f48-a77b-9fa7d7054be8"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/ded72a95c220904a151d27daf3c67e8644e386c6"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
