  "id": "CURL-CVE-2015-3144",
  "summary": "hostname out of boundary memory access",
  "details": "There is a private function in libcurl called `fix_hostname()` that removes a\ntrailing dot from the hostname if there is one. The function is called after\nthe hostname has been extracted from the URL libcurl has been told to act on.\n\nIf a URL is given with a zero-length hostname, like in \"http://:80\" or just\n\":80\", `fix_hostname()` indexes the hostname pointer with a -1 offset (as it\nblindly assumes a non-zero length) and both read and assign that address.\n\nAt best, this gets unnoticed but can also lead to a crash or worse. We have\nnot researched further what kind of malicious actions that potentially this\ncould be used for.",
