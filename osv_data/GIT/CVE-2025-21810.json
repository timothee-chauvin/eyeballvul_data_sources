core: class: Fix wild pointer dereferences in API class_dev_iter_next()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndriver core: class: Fix wild pointer dereferences in API class_dev_iter_next()\n\nThere are a potential wild pointer dereferences issue regarding APIs\nclass_dev_iter_(init|next|exit)(), as explained by below typical usage:\n\n// All members of @iter are wild pointers.\nstruct class_dev_iter iter;\n\n// class_dev_iter_init(@iter, @class, ...) checks parameter @class for\n// potential class_to_subsys() error, and it returns void type and does\n// not initialize its output parameter @iter, so caller can not detect\n// the error and continues to invoke class_dev_iter_next(@iter) even if\n// @iter still contains wild pointers.\nclass_dev_iter_init(&iter, ...);\n\n// Dereference these wild pointers in @iter here once suffer the error.\nwhile (dev = class_dev_iter_next(&iter)) { ... };\n\n// Also dereference these wild pointers here.\nclass_dev_iter_exit(&iter);\n\nActually, all callers of these APIs have such usage pattern in kernel tree.\nFix by:\n- Initialize output parameter @iter by memset() in class_dev_iter_init()\n  and give callers prompt by pr_crit() for the error.\n- Check if @iter is valid in class_dev_iter_next().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"7b884b7f24b42fa25e92ed724ad82f137610afaf"},{"fixed":"f4b9bc823b0cfdebfed479c0e87d6939c7562e87"},{"fixed":"1614e75d1a1b63db6421c7a4bf37004720c7376c"},{"fixed":"5c504e9767b947cf7d4e29b811c0c8b3c53242b7"},{"fixed":"e128f82f7006991c99a58114f70ef61e937b1ac1"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.13.1","v6.3","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.5","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.59","v6.6.6","v6.6.60","v6.6.61","v6.6.62","v6.6.63","v6.6.64","v6.6.65","v6.6.66","v6.6.67","v6.6.68","v6.6.69","v6.6.7","v6.6.70","v6.6.71","v6.6.72","v6.6.73","v6.6.74","v6.6.75","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21810.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.4.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.76"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.13"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.13.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21810.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1614e75d1a1b63db6421c7a4bf37004720c7376c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5c504e9767b947cf7d4e29b811c0c8b3c53242b7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e128f82f7006991c99a58114f70ef61e937b1ac1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f4b9bc823b0cfdebfed479c0e87d6939c7562e87"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/21xxx/CVE-2025-21810.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21810"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/21xxx/CVE-2025-21810.json"}}
