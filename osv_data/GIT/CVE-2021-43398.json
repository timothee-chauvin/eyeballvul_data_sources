There is a clear correlation between execution time and private key length, which may cause disclosure of the length information of the private key. This might allow attackers to conduct timing attacks. NOTE: this report is disputed by the vendor and multiple third parties. The execution-time differences are intentional. A user may make a choice of a longer key as a tradeoff between strength and performance. In making this choice, the amount of information leaked to an adversary is of infinitesimal value","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"69bf6b53052b59ccb57ce068ce741988ae087317"}]}],"versions":["CRYPTOPP_5_0","CRYPTOPP_5_1","CRYPTOPP_5_2","CRYPTOPP_5_2_1","CRYPTOPP_5_2_3","CRYPTOPP_5_3_0","CRYPTOPP_5_4","CRYPTOPP_5_5","CRYPTOPP_5_5_1","CRYPTOPP_5_5_2","CRYPTOPP_5_6_0","CRYPTOPP_5_6_1","CRYPTOPP_5_6_2","CRYPTOPP_5_6_3","CRYPTOPP_5_6_4","CRYPTOPP_5_6_5","CRYPTOPP_6_0_0","CRYPTOPP_6_1_0","CRYPTOPP_7_0_0","CRYPTOPP_8_0_0","CRYPTOPP_8_1_0","CRYPTOPP_8_2_0","CRYPTOPP_8_3_0","CRYPTOPP_8_4_0","CRYPTOPP_8_5_0","CRYPTOPP_8_6_0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-43398.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://cryptopp.com"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/1080"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/1080#issuecomment-996492222"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
