However between the\nread and re-locking the page we could have called release_folio() on the\npage, but left the page in the file mapping.  release_folio() can clear\nthe page private, and thus further down we blow up when we go to modify\nthe subpage bits.\n\nFix this by putting the set_page_extent_mapped() after the read.  This\nis safe because read_folio() will call set_page_extent_mapped() before\nit does the read, and then if we clear page private but leave it on the\nmapping we're completely safe re-setting set_page_extent_mapped().  With\nthis patch I can now run generic/476 without panicing.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"32443de3382be98c0a8b8f6f50d23da2e10c4117"},{"fixed":"0a5e0bc8e8618e32a6ca64450867628eb0a627bf"},{"fixed":"a5880e69cf7fe4a0bb1eabae02205352d1b59b7b"},{"fixed":"17b17fcd6d446b95904a6929c40012ee7f0afc0c"}]}],"versions":["v5.11","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.4.1","v6.4.2","v6.4.3","v6.4.4","v6.4.5","v6.4.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53247.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.42"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53247.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0a5e0bc8e8618e32a6ca64450867628eb0a627bf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/17b17fcd6d446b95904a6929c40012ee7f0afc0c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a5880e69cf7fe4a0bb1eabae02205352d1b59b7b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53247.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53247"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53247.json"}}
