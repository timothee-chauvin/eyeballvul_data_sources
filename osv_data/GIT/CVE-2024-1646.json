The application checks if the host parameter is not '0.0.0.0' to restrict access, which is inadequate when the application is bound to a specific interface, allowing unauthorized access to endpoints such as '/restart_program', '/update_software', '/check_update', '/start_recording', and '/stop_recording'. This vulnerability can lead to denial of service, unauthorized disabling or overriding of recordings, and potentially other impacts if certain features are enabled in the configuration.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"02e829b5653a1aa5dbbe9413ec84f96caa1274e8"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9","v3.0","v3.5","v4.0","v5.0","v6.0","v6.5","v6.5.0","v6.5rc2","v6.7","v7.0","v8.0","v8.5","v9.0","v9.1","v9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-1646.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/2f769c46-aa85-4ab8-8b08-fe791313b7ba"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui/commit/02e829b5653a1aa5dbbe9413ec84f96caa1274e8"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H"}]}
