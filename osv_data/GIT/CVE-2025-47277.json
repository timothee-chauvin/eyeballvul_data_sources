{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-47277","published":"2025-05-20T17:32:27Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:46:23.096062Z","aliases":["GHSA-hjq4-87xh-g4fv"],"related":["CGA-56h7-5qcr-8477"],"summary":"vLLM Allows Remote Code Execution via PyNcclPipe Communication Service","details":"vLLM, an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs), has an issue in versions 0.6.5 through 0.8.4 that ONLY impacts environments using the `PyNcclPipe` KV cache transfer integration with the V0 engine. No other configurations are affected. vLLM supports the use of the `PyNcclPipe` class to establish a peer-to-peer communication domain for data transmission between distributed nodes. The GPU-side KV-Cache transmission is implemented through the `PyNcclCommunicator` class, while CPU-side control message passing is handled via the `send_obj` and `recv_obj` methods on the CPU side.​ The intention was that this interface should only be exposed to a private network using the IP address specified by the `--kv-ip` CLI parameter. The vLLM documentation covers how this must be limited to a secured network. The default and intentional behavior from PyTorch is that the `TCPStore` interface listens on ALL interfaces, regardless of what IP address is provided. The IP address given was only used as a client-side address to use. vLLM was fixed to use a workaround to force the `TCPStore` instance to bind its socket to a specified private interface. As of version 0.8.5, vLLM limits the `TCPStore` socket to the private interface as configured.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm","events":[{"introduced":"2d1b9baa8f57fc59912c7bcd07fd630fb9d72c9d"},{"fixed":"ba41cc90e8ef7f236347b2f1599eec2cbb9e1f0d"}]}],"versions":["v0.6.5","v0.6.6","v0.6.6.post1","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.8.0rc1","v0.8.0rc2","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3rc1","v0.8.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-47277.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-hjq4-87xh-g4fv"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/0d6e187e88874c39cda7409cf673f9e6546893e7"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/15988"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/deployment/security.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
