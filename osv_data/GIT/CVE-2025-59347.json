Prior to 2.1.0, The Manager disables TLS certificate verification in HTTP clients. The clients are not configurable, so users have no way to re-enable the verification. A Manager processes dozens of preheat jobs. An adversary performs a network-level Man-in-the-Middle attack, providing invalid data to the Manager. The Manager preheats with the wrong data, which later causes a denial of service and file integrity problems.
