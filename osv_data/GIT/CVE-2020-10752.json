This flaw allows an attacker with the ability to cause an API Server error to read the logs, and use the leaked OAuthToken to log into the API Server with the leaked token.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openshift/origin","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0cbc58b117403b9d9169dbafdfac59ef104bb997"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.1","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc1","v1.2.0-rc2","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-alpha.0","v1.3.0-alpha.1","v1.3.0-alpha.2","v1.3.0-alpha.3","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.4.0-alpha.0","v1.4.0-alpha.1","v1.5.0-alpha.0","v1.5.0-alpha.1","v1.5.0-alpha.2","v1.5.0-alpha.3","v3.10.0-alpha.0","v3.10.0-rc.0","v3.11.0","v3.11.0-alpha.0","v3.6.0-alpha.0","v3.6.0-alpha.1","v3.6.0-alpha.2","v3.6.0-rc.0","v3.7.0-alpha.0","v3.7.0-alpha.1","v3.7.0-rc.0","v3.8.0-alpha.0","v3.8.0-alpha.1","v3.9.0-alpha.0","v3.9.0-alpha.1","v3.9.0-alpha.2","v3.9.0-alpha.3","v3.9.0-alpha.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-10752.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/323"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/vendor/k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/server/filters/wrap.go#L39"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
