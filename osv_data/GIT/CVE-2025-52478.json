{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-52478","published":"2025-08-19T16:32:34Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:47:35.756542Z","aliases":["GHSA-hfmv-hhh3-43f2"],"summary":"Stored XSS in n8n Form Trigger allows Account Takeover via injected iframe and video/source","details":"n8n is a workflow automation platform. From 1.77.0 to before 1.98.2, a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in n8n, specifically in the Form Trigger node's HTML form element. An authenticated attacker can inject malicious HTML via an <iframe> with a srcdoc payload that includes arbitrary JavaScript execution. The attacker can also inject malicious Javascript by using <video> coupled <source> using an onerror event. While using iframe or a combination of video and source tag, this vulnerability allows for Account Takeover (ATO) by exfiltrating n8n-browserId and session cookies from authenticated users who visit a maliciously crafted form. Using these tokens and cookies, an attacker can impersonate the victim and change account details such as email addresses, enabling full control over the accountâ€”especially if 2FA is not enabled. Users should upgrade to version >= 1.98.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n","events":[{"introduced":"812619e375c316be141dd39b9fb82a4714cd75ad"},{"fixed":"462acf12d9e4e159e4a56fbacd204c436604740e"}]}],"versions":["n8n@1.77.0","n8n@1.78.0","n8n@1.79.0","n8n@1.80.0","n8n@1.81.0","n8n@1.82.0","n8n@1.83.0","n8n@1.84.0","n8n@1.85.0","n8n@1.86.0","n8n@1.87.0","n8n@1.88.0","n8n@1.89.0","n8n@1.90.0","n8n@1.91.0","n8n@1.92.0","n8n@1.93.0","n8n@1.94.0","n8n@1.95.0","n8n@1.96.0","n8n@1.97.0","n8n@1.98.0","n8n@1.98.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52478.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/security/advisories/GHSA-hfmv-hhh3-43f2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/commit/7940384a85041a1890b1203d69c092c887312500"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/16329"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
