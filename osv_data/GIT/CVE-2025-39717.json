{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-39717","published":"2025-09-05T17:21:24.528Z","modified":"2025-11-20T09:59:09.105540Z","summary":"open_tree_attr: do not allow id-mapping changes without OPEN_TREE_CLONE","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nopen_tree_attr: do not allow id-mapping changes without OPEN_TREE_CLONE\n\nAs described in commit 7a54947e727b ('Merge patch series \"fs: allow\nchanging idmappings\"'), open_tree_attr(2) was necessary in order to\nallow for a detached mount to be created and have its idmappings changed\nwithout the risk of any racing threads operating on it. For this reason,\nmount_setattr(2) still does not allow for id-mappings to be changed.\n\nHowever, there was a bug in commit 2462651ffa76 (\"fs: allow changing\nidmappings\") which allowed users to bypass this restriction by calling\nopen_tree_attr(2) *without* OPEN_TREE_CLONE.\n\ncan_idmap_mount() prevented this bug from allowing an attached\nmountpoint's id-mapping from being modified (thanks to an is_anon_ns()\ncheck), but this still allows for detached (but visible) mounts to have\ntheir be id-mapping changed. This risks the same UAF and locking issues\nas described in the merge commit, and was likely unintentional.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"2462651ffa76b87f9c2e4403ef6e6b89b703fb2f"},{"fixed":"69dbdc711d9130136824e3830191a6afffa0a1f0"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"2462651ffa76b87f9c2e4403ef6e6b89b703fb2f"},{"fixed":"9308366f062129d52e0ee3f7a019f7dd41db33df"}]}],"versions":["v6.14","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.16.1","v6.16.2","v6.16.3","v6.17-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39717.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"257779351771043534673592542368091308881","length":770},"id":"CVE-2025-39717-1564b64c","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git@69dbdc711d9130136824e3830191a6afffa0a1f0","target":{"file":"fs/namespace.c","function":"SYSCALL_DEFINE5"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["20439470029033160254394001568813954970","74347574961622404774238195584650655765","235959232276708592866749526865966829732","102873088393263689601384554077523205793"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2025-39717-68221d36","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git@69dbdc711d9130136824e3830191a6afffa0a1f0","target":{"file":"fs/namespace.c"}}]}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.15.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39717.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/69dbdc711d9130136824e3830191a6afffa0a1f0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9308366f062129d52e0ee3f7a019f7dd41db33df"}]}
