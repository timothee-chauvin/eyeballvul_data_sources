{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-22411","published":"2024-01-16T21:57:44.824Z","modified":"2025-12-05T03:12:49.689441Z","aliases":["GHSA-g8vp-2v5p-9qfh"],"summary":"Cross site scripting in Action messages on Avo","details":"Avo is a framework to create admin panels for Ruby on Rails apps. In Avo 3 pre12, any HTML inside text that is passed to `error` or `succeed` in an `Avo::BaseAction` subclass will be rendered directly without sanitization in the toast/notification that appears in the UI on Action completion. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to trigger a cross site scripting attack on an unsuspecting user. This issue has been addressed in the 3.3.0 and 2.47.0 releases of Avo. Users are advised to upgrade.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/avo-hq/avo","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"92a8165740969d4e0d8704ab788c25215ce40bd9"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.1","v0.1.11","v0.1.13","v0.1.14","v0.1.15","v0.1.16","v0.1.19","v0.1.2","v0.1.20","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.1.9","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.3.0","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.10","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.4.8","v0.4.9","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.1.0","v1.1.0.pre.1","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.11.4","v1.11.5","v1.11.6","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.12.3","v1.12.4","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.13.3","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.16.1","v1.16.2","v1.16.3","v1.16.4","v1.17.0","v1.17.1","v1.18.0","v1.18.1","v1.18.2","v1.19.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.10","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.2.9","v1.20.0","v1.20.1","v1.21.0","v1.22.0","v1.22.1","v1.22.2","v1.22.3","v1.22.4","v1.23.0","v1.24.0","v1.24.1","v1.24.2","v1.25.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.10.2","v2.11.0","v2.12.0","v2.13.0","v2.13.1","v2.14.0","v2.14.1","v2.14.2","v2.15.0","v2.15.1","v2.15.2","v2.15.3","v2.16.0","v2.17.0","v2.18.0","v2.19.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.20.0","v2.21.0","v2.22.0","v2.23.0","v2.23.1","v2.23.2","v2.24.0","v2.24.1","v2.25.0","v2.26.0","v2.27.0","v2.27.1","v2.28.0","v2.29.0","v2.29.1","v2.3.0","v2.30.0","v2.30.1","v2.30.2","v2.31.0","v2.32.0","v2.32.1","v2.32.2","v2.32.3","v2.32.4","v2.32.5","v2.32.6","v2.33.0","v2.33.1","v2.33.2","v2.33.3","v2.34.0","v2.34.1","v2.34.2","v2.34.3","v2.34.4","v2.34.5","v2.34.6","v2.35.0","v2.36.0","v2.36.1","v2.36.2","v2.36.3","v2.37.0","v2.37.1","v2.37.2","v2.38.0","v2.39.0","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.40.0","v2.41.0","v2.42.0","v2.42.1","v2.42.2","v2.43.0","v2.44.0","v2.45.0","v2.46.0","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-22411.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/22xxx/CVE-2024-22411.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/commit/51bb80b181cd8e31744bdc4e7f9b501c81172347"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/commit/fc92a05a8556b1787c8694643286a1afa6a71258"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/releases/tag/v2.47.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/releases/tag/v3.3.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/security/advisories/GHSA-g8vp-2v5p-9qfh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22411"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/22xxx/CVE-2024-22411.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
