In this scenario, fs_core may set the\nhardware deletion function to NULL prematurely, causing a panic during\nsubsequent rule deletions.\n\nTo prevent this, ensure the active flag of the FTE is checked under a lock,\nwhich will prevent the fs_core layer from attaching a new steering rule to\nan FTE that is in the process of deletion.\n\n[  438.967589] MOSHE: 2496 mlx5_del_flow_rules
