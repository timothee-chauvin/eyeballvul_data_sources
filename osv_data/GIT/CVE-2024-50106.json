Laundromat thread\nfinds that delegation has expired and needs to be revoked so it\nmarks the delegation stid revoked and it puts it on a reaper list\nbut then it unlock the state lock and the actual delegation revocation\nhappens without the lock. Once the stid is marked revoked a racing\nfree_stateid processing thread does the following (1) it calls\nlist_del_init() which removes it from the reaper list and (2) frees\nthe delegation stid structure. The laundromat thread ends up not\ncalling the revoke_delegation() function for this particular delegation\nbut that means it will no release the lock lease that exists on\nthe file.\n\nNow, a new open for this file comes in and ends up finding that\nlease list isn't empty and calls nfsd_breaker_owns_lease() which ends\nup trying to derefence a freed delegation stateid. Leading to the\nfollowint use-after-free KASAN warning:\n\nkernel: ==================================================================\nkernel: BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in nfsd_breaker_owns_lease+0x140/0x160 [nfsd]\nkernel: Read of size 8 at addr ffff0000e73cd0c8 by task nfsd/6205\nkernel:\nkernel: CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 6205 Comm: nfsd Kdump: loaded Not tainted 6.11.0-rc7+ #9\nkernel: Hardware name: Apple Inc.

Then, coordinating whether the stid has been put\non the cl_revoked list or we are processing FREE_STATEID and need to\nmake sure to remove it from the list, each check that state and act\naccordingly. If laundromat has added to the cl_revoke list before\nthe arrival of FREE_STATEID, then nfsd4_free_stateid() knows to remove\nit from the list. If nfsd4_free_stateid() finds that operations arrived\nbefore laundromat has placed it on cl_revoke list, it marks the state\nfreed and then laundromat will no longer add it to the list.\n\nAlso, for nfsd4_delegreturn() when looking for the specified stid,\nwe need to access stid that are marked removed or freeable, it means\nthe laundromat has started processing it but hasn't finished and this\ndelegreturn needs to return nfserr_deleg_revoked and not\nnfserr_bad_stateid. The latter will not trigger a FREE_STATEID and the\nlack of it will leave this stid on the cl_revoked list indefinitely.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"83e733161fde43e2f99cefa68e369944460fce39"},{"fixed":"967faa26f313a62e7bebc55d5b8122eaee43b929"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"83e733161fde43e2f99cefa68e369944460fce39"},{"fixed":"8dd91e8d31febf4d9cca3ae1bb4771d33ae7ee5a"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.11.1","v6.11.2","v6.11.3","v6.11.4","v6.11.5","v6.8","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-50106.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.9.0"},{"fixed":"6.11.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-50106.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8dd91e8d31febf4d9cca3ae1bb4771d33ae7ee5a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/967faa26f313a62e7bebc55d5b8122eaee43b929"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
