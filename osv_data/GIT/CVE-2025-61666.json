Default installs of Traccar on Windows between versions 6.1-  6.8.1 and non default installs between versions 5.8 - 6.0 are vulnerable to unauthenticated local file inclusion attacks which can lead to leakage of passwords or any file on the file system including the Traccar configuration file. Versions 5.8 - 6.0 are only vulnerable if <entry key='web.override'>./override</entry> is set in the configuration file. Versions 6.1 - 6.8.1 are vulnerable by default as the web override is enabled by default. The vulnerable code is removed in version 6.9.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/traccar/traccar","events":[{"introduced":"a24d7d5d7a61946b45ed5d344fee0a0e27bd3144"},{"fixed":"001bccee54cbd516b5369c73cc338319d30122fc"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"5.8"},{"fixed":"6.9.0"}]}}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.11","v5.12","v5.8","v5.9","v6.0","v6.1","v6.2","v6.3","v6.4","v6.5","v6.6","v6.7.0","v6.7.1","v6.7.2","v6.7.3","v6.8.0","v6.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-61666.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/traccar/traccar/blob/v6.8.1/src/main/java/org/traccar/web/DefaultOverrideServlet.java"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/traccar/traccar/security/advisories/GHSA-hprc-rph8-fj87"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://projectblack.io/blog/jetty-addpath-lfi"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
