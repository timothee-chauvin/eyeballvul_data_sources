When starting a gateway, TLS authentication will only be attempted on endpoints identified in DNS SRV records for a given domain, which occurs in the discoverEndpoints function. No authentication is performed against endpoints provided in the --endpoints flag. This has been fixed in versions 3.4.10 and 3.3.23 with improved documentation and deprecation of the functionality.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd","events":[{"introduced":"c23606781f63d09917a1e7abfcefeb337a9608ea"},{"fixed":"4873f5516bd98c82dddb81247038337f25abac4e"}]}],"versions":["v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.10","v3.3.11","v3.3.12","v3.3.13","v3.3.14","v3.3.14-beta.0","v3.3.14-rc.0","v3.3.15","v3.3.16","v3.3.17","v3.3.18","v3.3.19","v3.3.2","v3.3.20","v3.3.21","v3.3.22","v3.3.3","v3.3.4","v3.3.5","v3.3.6","v3.3.7","v3.3.8","v3.3.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-15136.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/gateway.md"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L6B6R43Y7M3DCHWK3L3UVGE2K6WWECMP/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/security/advisories/GHSA-wr2v-9rpq-c35q"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
