Prior to 2.10.9 and 2.11.4, session ids could be fixed by an attacker if the site is configured with server-side session storage (CKAN uses cookie-based session storage by default). The attacker would need to either set a cookie on the victim's browser or steal the victim's currently valid session. Session identifiers are now regenerated after each login. This vulnerability has been fixed in CKAN 2.10.9 and 2.11.4","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ckan/ckan","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"466f516528a736b60ed3ca60f5574a00c0522709"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.10.9"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ckan/ckan","events":[{"introduced":"710dfff718859ff284f0e9feee70c1ecfc86677a"},{"fixed":"882f16b6de851e30345bfd06417512e79f890941"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.11.0"},{"fixed":"2.11.4"}]}}],"versions":["ckan-1.3.3b","ckan-1.4","ckan-1.4.1","ckan-1.4.2","ckan-1.4.3","ckan-1.5","ckan-1.5.1","ckan-1.6","ckan-1.7","ckan-2.10.0","ckan-2.10.1","ckan-2.10.2","ckan-2.10.3","ckan-2.10.4","ckan-2.10.5","ckan-2.10.6","ckan-2.10.7","ckan-2.10.8","ckan-2.11.0","ckan-2.11.1","ckan-2.11.2","ckan-2.11.3","demo-0.1","demo-0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64100.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ckan/ckan/commit/c2fe437f88be850a6edf7a32470772428819fab5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ckan/ckan/security/advisories/GHSA-2hvh-cw5c-8q8q"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-384"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
