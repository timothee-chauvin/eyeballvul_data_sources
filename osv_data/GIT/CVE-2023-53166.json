So there is a window\nwhere bq25890_charger_external_power_changed() may get called while\nbq->charger has not been set yet leading to a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nThis race hits during boot sometimes on a Lenovo Yoga Book 1 yb1-x90f\nwhen the cht_wcove_pwrsrc (extcon) power_supply is done with detecting\nthe connected charger-type which happens to exactly hit the small window:\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000018\n  <snip>\n  RIP: 0010:__power_supply_is_supplied_by+0xb/0xb0\n  <snip>\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   __power_supply_get_supplier_property+0x19/0x50\n   class_for_each_device+0xb1/0xe0\n   power_supply_get_property_from_supplier+0x2e/0x50\n   bq25890_charger_external_power_changed+0x38/0x1b0 [bq25890_charger]\n   __power_supply_changed_work+0x30/0x40\n   class_for_each_device+0xb1/0xe0\n   power_supply_changed_work+0x5f/0xe0\n  <snip>\n\nFixing this is easy.
