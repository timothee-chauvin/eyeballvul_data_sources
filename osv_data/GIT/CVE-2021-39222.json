The Nextcloud Talk application was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, a user would need to right-click on a malicious file and open the file in a new tab. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk application is upgraded to patched versions 10.0.7, 10.1.4, 11.1.2, 11.2.0 or 12.0.0. As a workaround, use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/talk-android","events":[{"introduced":"f1df514ff0b6000a640c9f0dee70773f79ad7d7f"},{"fixed":"2f661b8076e79c9df8941cbadce59750cd7dfb0f"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-39222.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-xhxq-f4vg-jw5g"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/pull/542"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1135481"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
