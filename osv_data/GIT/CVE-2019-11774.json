This can lead to a variety of different issues but read out of array bounds is one major consequence of these problems.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/eclipse-omr/omr","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20db4fbc1ea570fd806783a97b16831f4f719eed"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-11774.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=549192"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
