Prior to version 0.17.13, the skip field in the built-in `label-sheet` plugin lacks an upper bound, so a large value forces the server to allocate an enormous Python list. This lets any authenticated label-printing user trigger a denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. the issue is fixed in versions 0.17.13 and higher. No workaround is available aside from upgrading to the patched version.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/inventree/inventree","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2a7f5f94c8dc1d05b417e654225d4da75f7791bd"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-49000.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/49xxx/CVE-2025-49000.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/commit/0826a75ef6dde0ad96d680f52a9cf171ba2ce98b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/releases/tag/0.17.13"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/security/advisories/GHSA-m2ch-h84r-p9r6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49000"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-400","CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/49xxx/CVE-2025-49000.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
