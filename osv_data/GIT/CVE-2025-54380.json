Prior to version 17.6, Opencast would incorrectly send the hashed global system account credentials (ie: org.opencastproject.security.digest.user and org.opencastproject.security.digest.pass) when attempting to fetch mediapackage elements included in a mediapackage XML file. A previous CVE prevented many cases where the credentials were inappropriately sent, but not all. Anyone with ingest permissions could cause Opencast to send its hashed global system account credentials to a url of their choosing. This issue is fixed in Opencast 17.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opencast/opencast","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5a1adbb0c79fd11a9e2dcf7b3b6e5b0850ef1914"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54380.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/e8980435342149375802648b9c9e696c9a5f0c9a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-hcxx-mp6g-6gr9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-j63h-hmgw-x4j7"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200","CWE-522"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
