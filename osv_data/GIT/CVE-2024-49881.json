But after reallocating and successfully initializing\nthe path, we don't update *orig_path, in which case the caller gets a\nvalid path but a NULL ppath, and this may cause a NULL pointer dereference\nor a path memory leak. For example:\n\next4_split_extent\n  path = *ppath = 2000\n  ext4_find_extent\n    if (depth > path[0].p_maxdepth)\n      kfree(path = 2000);\n      *orig_path = path = NULL;\n      path = kcalloc() =
