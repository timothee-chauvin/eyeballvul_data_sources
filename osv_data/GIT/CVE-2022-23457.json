{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-23457","published":"2022-04-25T00:00:00Z","modified":"2025-12-04T10:10:54.546993Z","aliases":["GHSA-8m5h-hrqm-pxm2"],"summary":"Path Traversal in ESAPI","details":"ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web application security control library. Prior to version 2.3.0.0, the default implementation of `Validator.getValidDirectoryPath(String, String, File, boolean)` may incorrectly treat the tested input string as a child of the specified parent directory. This potentially could allow control-flow bypass checks to be defeated if an attack can specify the entire string representing the 'input' path. This vulnerability is patched in release 2.3.0.0 of ESAPI. As a workaround, it is possible to write one's own implementation of the Validator interface. However, maintainers do not recommend this.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/esapi/esapi-java-legacy","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7797bc3ebd3a3bd700817b27e2a4455a0ba61f33"}]}],"versions":["esapi-2.1.0.1","esapi-2.2.0.0","esapi-2.2.0.0-RC1","esapi-2.2.0.0-RC2","esapi-2.2.0.0-RC3","esapi-2.2.1.0","esapi-2.2.1.0-RC1","esapi-2.2.1.1","esapi-2.2.2.0","esapi-2.2.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23457.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/23xxx/CVE-2022-23457.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.3.0.0-release-notes.txt"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/security/advisories/GHSA-8m5h-hrqm-pxm2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/07/msg00010.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23457"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230127-0014/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2022-008_The_OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/23xxx/CVE-2022-23457.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
