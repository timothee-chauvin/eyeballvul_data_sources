Prior to version 4.5.4, an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the poll duplication endpoint (/api/trpc/polls.duplicate) allows any authenticated user to duplicate polls they do not own by modifying the pollId parameter. This effectively bypasses access control and lets unauthorized users clone private or administrative polls. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lukevella/rallly","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0bc349040885ba48ac02ce386140084b0d847a9a"}]}],"versions":["v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.11.1","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.8.3","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v2.9.2","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-rc1","v3.0.1","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.10.0","v3.11.0","v3.11.1","v3.11.2","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.4.2","v3.5.0","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.7.0","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.2.0","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.5.2","v4.5.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65020.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lukevella/rallly/releases/tag/v4.5.4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/lukevella/rallly/security/advisories/GHSA-44w7-pf32-gv5m"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-285","CWE-639","CWE-862"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
