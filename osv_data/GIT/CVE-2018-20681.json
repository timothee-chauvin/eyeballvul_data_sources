By unplugging and re-plugging or power-cycling external output devices (such as additionally attached graphical outputs via HDMI, VGA, DVI, etc.) the content of a screensaver-locked session can be revealed. In some scenarios, the attacker can execute applications, such as by clicking with a mouse.",
