This allocation did not initialize tx_tstamps. This\nresults in the tx_tstamps field being zero (due to kcalloc allocation), and\nwould result in a NULL pointer dereference when attempting a transmit\ntimestamp on the new ring.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ea9b847cda647b9849b0b9fa0447e876a1ac62e1"},{"fixed":"624f03a027f2b18647cc4f1a7a81920a1e4e0201"},{"fixed":"13180cb88a7be5ee389f65f6ab9f78e46f7722b2"},{"fixed":"9eb5fff6b0e78819c758892282da5faa915724d0"},{"fixed":"b3b173745c8cab1e24d6821488b60abed3acb24d"}]}],"versions":["v5.13","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.8","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.19.1","v5.19.10","v5.19.11","v5.19.12","v5.19.13","v5.19.14","v5.19.15","v5.19.16","v5.19.2","v5.19.3","v5.19.4","v5.19.5","v5.19.6","v5.19.7","v5.19.8","v5.19.9","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50710.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.14.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.75"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.19.17"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.20.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50710.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/13180cb88a7be5ee389f65f6ab9f78e46f7722b2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/624f03a027f2b18647cc4f1a7a81920a1e4e0201"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9eb5fff6b0e78819c758892282da5faa915724d0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b3b173745c8cab1e24d6821488b60abed3acb24d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50710.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50710"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50710.json"}}
