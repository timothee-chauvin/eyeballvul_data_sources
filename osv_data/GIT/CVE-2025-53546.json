Using pull_request_target on .github/workflows/auto-fix-lint-format-commit.yml can be exploited by attackers, since untrusted code can be executed having full access to secrets (from the base repo). By exploiting the vulnerability is possible to exfiltrate GITHUB_TOKEN which has high privileges. GITHUB_TOKEN can be used to completely overtake the repo since the token has content write privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in commit 585c6a591440cd39f92374230ac5d65d7dd23d6a.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rssnext/folo","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"585c6a591440cd39f92374230ac5d65d7dd23d6a"}]}],"versions":["desktop@0.4.3","desktop@0.4.4","desktop@0.4.5","desktop@0.4.6","desktop@0.4.8","desktop@0.5.0","mobile@0.1.7","mobile@0.1.8","mobile@0.1.9","mobile@0.2.0","mobile@0.2.1","v0.0.1-alpha.1","v0.0.1-alpha.10","v0.0.1-alpha.11","v0.0.1-alpha.12","v0.0.1-alpha.13","v0.0.1-alpha.14","v0.0.1-alpha.15","v0.0.1-alpha.16","v0.0.1-alpha.17","v0.0.1-alpha.18","v0.0.1-alpha.19","v0.0.1-alpha.2","v0.0.1-alpha.20","v0.0.1-alpha.21","v0.0.1-alpha.22","v0.0.1-alpha.3","v0.0.1-alpha.4","v0.0.1-alpha.5","v0.0.1-alpha.6","v0.0.1-alpha.7","v0.0.1-alpha.8","v0.0.1-alpha.9","v0.0.1-internal.1","v0.1.0-beta.0","v0.1.1-beta.0","v0.1.1-beta.1","v0.1.2-beta.0","v0.2.0-beta.0","v0.2.0-beta.1","v0.2.0-beta.2","v0.2.1-beta.0","v0.2.2-beta.0","v0.2.3-beta.0","v0.2.5-beta.0","v0.2.6-beta.0","v0.2.7-beta.0","v0.2.8-beta.0","v0.2.9-beta.0","v0.3.0-beta.0","v0.3.1-beta.0","v0.3.10","v0.3.11","v0.3.12","v0.3.13","v0.3.2-beta.0","v0.3.3-beta.0","v0.3.4-beta.0","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.3.8","v0.3.9","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.4.8","v0.4.9","v0.5.0","v0.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53546.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/53xxx/CVE-2025-53546.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/RSSNext/Folo/commit/585c6a591440cd39f92374230ac5d65d7dd23d6a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/RSSNext/Folo/security/advisories/GHSA-h87r-5w74-qfm4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53546"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-829"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/53xxx/CVE-2025-53546.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
