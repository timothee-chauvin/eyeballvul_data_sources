Prior to version 2.4.15, a client that connects to cupsd but sends slow messages, e.g. only one byte per second, delays cupsd as a whole, such that it becomes unusable by other clients. This issue has been patched in version 2.4.15.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openprinting/cups","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"433af45db06759081d4f3cd606e08ca634fc490a"}]}],"versions":["v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.2.5","v2.2.6","v2.2b1","v2.2b2","v2.2rc1","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.3","v2.3.3op1","v2.3.3op2","v2.3b1","v2.3b2","v2.3b3","v2.3b4","v2.3b5","v2.3b6","v2.3b7","v2.3b8","v2.3rc1","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.10","v2.4.11","v2.4.12","v2.4.13","v2.4.14","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.5","v2.4.6","v2.4.7","v2.4.8","v2.4.9","v2.4b1","v2.4rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58436.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["77478087155392166827753678322261110249","199629161088706978755561407205027215243","242761163277272059188145473982024142479","31183038617601839798647281261141047645","290956483188464259330199195401068909924","47716117503936234012778123479968869248","127641381619247502457438674603461877569"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2025-58436-43860eb9","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/openprinting/cups/commit/433af45db06759081d4f3cd606e08ca634fc490a","target":{"file":"cups/cups.h"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/11/27/4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/commit/40008d76a001babbb9beb9d9d74b01a86fb6ddb4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/releases/tag/v2.4.15"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/security/advisories/GHSA-8wpw-vfgm-qrrr"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
