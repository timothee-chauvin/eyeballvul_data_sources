In versions <=0.9.11, http-signature signs only the header values, but not the header names. This makes http-signature vulnerable to header forgery. Thus, if an attacker can intercept a request, he can swap header names and change the meaning of the request without changing the signature.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"5a3e67916d1cf4e0924f61a0512940db9840c12e"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.7","v0.9.0","v0.9.11","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.6","v0.9.7","v0.9.8","v0.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-16005.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/issues/10"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/318"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
