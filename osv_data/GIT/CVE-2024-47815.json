There are a variety of Cross-site Scripting issues, though all of them require elevated permissions. Some are available to anyone who has the `editincidents` right, some are available to those who can edit interface messages (typically administrators and interface admins), and one is available to those who can edit LocalSettings.php. These issues have been addressed in commit `43896a4` and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should prevent access to the Special:IncidentReports page.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/miraheze/incidentreporting","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"43896a47de4e05ac94ec0472c220da944da16c5c"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47815.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/miraheze/IncidentReporting/commit/43896a47de4e05ac94ec0472c220da944da16c5c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/miraheze/IncidentReporting/security/advisories/GHSA-9p36-hrmr-98r9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/T12702"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79","CWE-80"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L"}]}
