Prior to version 1.10.8-lts, Sandbox only restricts the execution permissions of binary files in common directories, such as `/bin,/usr/bin`, etc. Therefore, attackers can exploit some files with execution permissions in non blacklisted directories to carry out attacks. Version 1.10.8-lts fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/1panel-dev/maxkb","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9d7a3833483ebe1a1b1bec767ae7f09d55b51244"}]}],"versions":["v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.10.0-lts","v1.10.1-lts","v1.10.2-lts","v1.10.3-lts","v1.10.4-lts","v1.10.5-lts","v1.10.6-lts","v1.10.7-lts","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48950.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/1Panel-dev/MaxKB/security/advisories/GHSA-p2qq-x9j2-px8v"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/1Panel-dev/MaxKB/commit/187e9c1e4ea1ebb6864c5bf61558c42f2fc6c005"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/1Panel-dev/MaxKB/pull/3127"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/1Panel-dev/MaxKB/releases/tag/v1.10.8-lts"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-276"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:P"}]}
