An attacker can import a file even when the target page is protected against \"page creation\" and the attacker should not be able to create it. This occurs because of a mishandled distinction between an upload restriction and a create restriction. An attacker cannot leverage this to overwrite anything, but can leverage this to force a wiki to have a page with a disallowed title.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e34e7f20b51ed7514ba6de8d8a390363ade2237f"}]}],"versions":["1.1.0","1.3.0beta1","1.34.0","1.34.0-rc.0","1.34.0-rc.1","1.34.1","1.34.2","1.34.3","1.5.0alpha1","1.5.0alpha2","1.5.0beta1","1.5.0beta2","1.5.0beta3","1.5.0beta4","1.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-26121.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=454609892#File:Wiki.png"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/q/Ib852a96afc4dca10516d0510e69c10f9892b351b"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T262628"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RTTPZ7XMDS66I442OLLHXBDNP2LCBJU6/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
