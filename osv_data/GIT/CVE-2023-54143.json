Normally, this is done\ninside the vdec_msg_queue_deinit() function.  However, if the\nfirst call to allocate &msg_queue->wdma_addr fails, then the\nvdec_msg_queue_deinit() function is a no-op.  For that situation, just\nset the size to zero explicitly and return.\n\nThere were two other error paths which did not clean up before returning.\nChange those error paths to goto mem_alloc_err.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"b199fe46f35c57a415acd4d5295b0f4e35048c11"},{"fixed":"858322c409e0aba8f70810d23f35c482744f007c"},{"fixed":"b7dbc27301f560c3b915235c53383155b3512083"},{"fixed":"451dc187cadd47771e5d9434fe220fad7be84057"},{"fixed":"cf10b0bb503c974ba049d6f888b21178be20a962"}]}],"versions":["v5.17","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.4.1","v6.4.10","v6.4.11","v6.4.12","v6.4.13","v6.4.14","v6.4.15","v6.4.2","v6.4.3","v6.4.4","v6.4.5","v6.4.6","v6.4.7","v6.4.8","v6.4.9","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.5.1","v6.5.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54143.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.53"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.16"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.5.0"},{"fixed":"6.5.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54143.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/451dc187cadd47771e5d9434fe220fad7be84057"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/858322c409e0aba8f70810d23f35c482744f007c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b7dbc27301f560c3b915235c53383155b3512083"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cf10b0bb503c974ba049d6f888b21178be20a962"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54143.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54143"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54143.json"}}
