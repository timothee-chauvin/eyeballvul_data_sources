The JSPUI controlled vocabulary servlet is vulnerable to an open redirect attack, where an attacker can craft a malicious URL that looks like a legitimate DSpace/repository URL. When that URL is clicked by the target, it redirects them to a site of the attacker's choice. This issue has been patched in versions 5.11 and 6.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workaround for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dspace/dspace","events":[{"introduced":"0fea17436854acf9048b0e11fbf988333ea02956"},{"fixed":"66647c7bf939b202a4872d4c5ebda23bc62e807f"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dspace/dspace","events":[{"introduced":"d34e7b89a30b5ffd35556d6fe8936e5d8659415d"},{"fixed":"d1795b598aa78c37cade6fbc83c8e4141f865a6e"}]}],"versions":["dspace-4.0","dspace-5.0","dspace-5.0-rc1","dspace-5.0-rc2","dspace-5.0-rc3","dspace-5.1","dspace-5.10","dspace-5.2","dspace-5.3","dspace-5.4","dspace-5.5","dspace-5.6","dspace-5.7","dspace-5.8","dspace-5.9","dspace-6.0","dspace-6.1","dspace-6.2","dspace-6.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31193.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-763j-q7wv-vf3m"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/5f72424a478f59061dcc516b866dcc687bc3f9de"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/f7758457b7ec3489d525e39aa753cc70809d9ad9"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
