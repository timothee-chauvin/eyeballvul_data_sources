In 0.1.2 and earlier, the MCPScanner class contains a critical Command Injection vulnerability in the cloneRepo method. The application passes the user-supplied githubUrl argument directly to a system shell via execSync without sanitization. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host machine by appending shell metacharacters to the URL.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kapilduraphe/mcp-watch","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e7da78c5b4b960f8b66c254059ad9ebc544a91a6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66401.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66401.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kapilduraphe/mcp-watch/commit/e7da78c5b4b960f8b66c254059ad9ebc544a91a6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/kapilduraphe/mcp-watch/security/advisories/GHSA-27m7-ffhq-jqrm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66401"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-78"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66401.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
