This occurs because there is no associated\nq_vector for the test ring when it is set up, as interrupts are typically\nnot added to the test rings.\n\nSince commit 5ef44b3cb43b removed the napi_id assignment in\n__xdp_rxq_info_reg(), there is no longer a need to pass a napi_id to it.\nTherefore, simply use 0 as the last parameter.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"2c6196013f84651772388a86dfd4bb033d0c0d45"},{"fixed":"473be7d39efd3be383e9c0c8e44b53508b4ffeb5"},{"fixed":"75871a525a596ff4d16c4aebc0018f8d0923c9b1"}]}],"versions":["v6.13","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.16.1","v6.16.2","v6.16.3","v6.16.4","v6.16.5","v6.16.6","v6.16.7","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39875.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.14.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39875.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/473be7d39efd3be383e9c0c8e44b53508b4ffeb5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/75871a525a596ff4d16c4aebc0018f8d0923c9b1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/39xxx/CVE-2025-39875.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39875"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/39xxx/CVE-2025-39875.json"}}
