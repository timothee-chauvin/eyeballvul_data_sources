A double fetch of guest controlled values `cursor->header.width` and `cursor->header.height` can lead to the allocation of a small cursor object followed by a subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. A malicious privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/qemu/qemu","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"823a3f11fb8f04c3c3cc0f95f968fef1bfc6534f"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.11.0-rc0","v0.12.0-rc0","v0.13.0-rc0","v0.14.0-rc0","v0.15.0-rc0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.5.0","v1.0","v1.0-rc0","v1.0-rc1","v1.0-rc2","v1.0-rc3","v1.0-rc4","v1.1-rc0","v1.1-rc1","v1.1-rc2","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc2","v1.1.0-rc3","v1.1.0-rc4","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc0","v1.2.0-rc1","v1.2.0-rc2","v1.2.0-rc3","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-rc0","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.3.0-rc2","v1.4.0","v1.4.0-rc0","v1.4.0-rc1","v1.4.0-rc2","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-rc0","v1.5.0-rc1","v1.5.0-rc2","v1.5.0-rc3","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc0","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.6.0-rc2","v1.6.0-rc3","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.7.0-rc2","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-rc0","v2.0.0-rc1","v2.0.0-rc2","v2.0.0-rc3","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-rc0","v2.1.0-rc1","v2.1.0-rc2","v2.1.0-rc3","v2.1.0-rc4","v2.1.0-rc5","v2.10.0","v2.10.0-rc0","v2.10.0-rc1","v2.10.0-rc2","v2.10.0-rc3","v2.10.0-rc4","v2.11.0","v2.11.0-rc0","v2.11.0-rc1","v2.11.0-rc2","v2.11.0-rc3","v2.11.0-rc4","v2.11.0-rc5","v2.12.0","v2.12.0-rc0","v2.12.0-rc1","v2.12.0-rc2","v2.12.0-rc3","v2.12.0-rc4","v2.2.0","v2.2.0-rc0","v2.2.0-rc1","v2.2.0-rc2","v2.2.0-rc3","v2.2.0-rc4","v2.2.0-rc5","v2.3.0","v2.3.0-rc0","v2.3.0-rc1","v2.3.0-rc2","v2.3.0-rc3","v2.3.0-rc4","v2.4.0","v2.4.0-rc0","v2.4.0-rc1","v2.4.0-rc2","v2.4.0-rc3","v2.4.0-rc4","v2.5.0","v2.5.0-rc0","v2.5.0-rc1","v2.5.0-rc2","v2.5.0-rc3","v2.5.0-rc4","v2.6.0","v2.6.0-rc0","v2.6.0-rc1","v2.6.0-rc2","v2.6.0-rc3","v2.6.0-rc4","v2.6.0-rc5","v2.7.0","v2.7.0-rc0","v2.7.0-rc1","v2.7.0-rc2","v2.7.0-rc3","v2.7.0-rc4","v2.7.0-rc5","v2.8.0","v2.8.0-rc0","v2.8.0-rc1","v2.8.0-rc2","v2.8.0-rc3","v2.8.0-rc4","v2.9.0","v2.9.0-rc0","v2.9.0-rc1","v2.9.0-rc2","v2.9.0-rc3","v2.9.0-rc4","v2.9.0-rc5","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-rc0","v3.0.0-rc1","v3.0.0-rc2","v3.0.0-rc3","v3.0.0-rc4","v3.1.0","v3.1.0-rc0","v3.1.0-rc1","v3.1.0-rc2","v3.1.0-rc3","v3.1.0-rc4","v3.1.0-rc5","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-rc0","v4.0.0-rc1","v4.0.0-rc2","v4.0.0-rc3","v4.0.0-rc4","v4.1.0","v4.1.0-rc0","v4.1.0-rc1","v4.1.0-rc2","v4.1.0-rc3","v4.1.0-rc4","v4.1.0-rc5","v4.2.0","v4.2.0-rc0","v4.2.0-rc1","v4.2.0-rc2","v4.2.0-rc3","v4.2.0-rc4","v4.2.0-rc5","v5.0.0","v5.0.0-rc0","v5.0.0-rc1","v5.0.0-rc2","v5.0.0-rc3","v5.0.0-rc4","v5.1.0","v5.1.0-rc0","v5.1.0-rc1","v5.1.0-rc2","v5.1.0-rc3","v5.2.0","v5.2.0-rc0","v5.2.0-rc1","v5.2.0-rc2","v5.2.0-rc3","v5.2.0-rc4","v6.0.0","v6.0.0-rc0","v6.0.0-rc1","v6.0.0-rc2","v6.0.0-rc3","v6.0.0-rc4","v6.0.0-rc5","v6.1.0","v6.1.0-rc0","v6.1.0-rc1","v6.1.0-rc2","v6.1.0-rc3","v6.1.0-rc4","v6.2.0","v6.2.0-rc0","v6.2.0-rc1","v6.2.0-rc3","v6.2.0-rc4","v7.0.0-rc0","v7.0.0-rc1","v7.0.0-rc2","v7.0.0-rc3","v7.0.0-rc4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-4207.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2036966"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00008.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-27"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://starlabs.sg/advisories/21-4207/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5133"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250321-0009/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
