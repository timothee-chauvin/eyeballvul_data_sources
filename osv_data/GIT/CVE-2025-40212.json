{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-40212","published":"2025-11-24T13:04:20.888Z","modified":"2025-12-01T20:49:55.842740Z","summary":"nfsd: fix refcount leak in nfsd_set_fh_dentry()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: fix refcount leak in nfsd_set_fh_dentry()\n\nnfsd exports a \"pseudo root filesystem\" which is used by NFSv4 to find\nthe various exported filesystems using LOOKUP requests from a known root\nfilehandle.  NFSv3 uses the MOUNT protocol to find those exported\nfilesystems and so is not given access to the pseudo root filesystem.\n\nIf a v3 (or v2) client uses a filehandle from that filesystem,\nnfsd_set_fh_dentry() will report an error, but still stores the export\nin \"struct svc_fh\" even though it also drops the reference (exp_put()).\nThis means that when fh_put() is called an extra reference will be dropped\nwhich can lead to use-after-free and possible denial of service.\n\nNormal NFS usage will not provide a pseudo-root filehandle to a v3\nclient.  This bug can only be triggered by the client synthesising an\nincorrect filehandle.\n\nTo fix this we move the assignments to the svc_fh later, after all\npossible error cases have been detected.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ef7f6c4904d03ccd7478e1ac20ed75f79c4ac444"},{"fixed":"b6bc86ce3944b10b9fc181fc00c1a520a20ed965"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ef7f6c4904d03ccd7478e1ac20ed75f79c4ac444"},{"fixed":"c83d7365cec5eb5ebeeee2a72e29b4ca58a7e4c2"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ef7f6c4904d03ccd7478e1ac20ed75f79c4ac444"},{"fixed":"8a7348a9ed70bda1c1f51d3f1815bcbdf9f3b38c"}]}],"versions":["v6.11","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40212.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.59"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40212.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8a7348a9ed70bda1c1f51d3f1815bcbdf9f3b38c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b6bc86ce3944b10b9fc181fc00c1a520a20ed965"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c83d7365cec5eb5ebeeee2a72e29b4ca58a7e4c2"}]}
