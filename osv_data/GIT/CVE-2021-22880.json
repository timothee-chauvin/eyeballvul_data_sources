Carefully crafted input can cause the input validation in the `money` type of the PostgreSQL adapter in Active Record to spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack. This only impacts Rails applications that are using PostgreSQL along with money type columns that take user input.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rails/rails","events":[{"introduced":"7847a19f476fb9bee287681586d872ea43785e53"},{"fixed":"dc7364b1f39cf2fa3c3af3ea0f239f9ae1b5a790"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-22880.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/cve-2021-22880-possible-dos-vulnerability-in-active-record-postgresql-adapter/77129"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MO5OJ3F4ZL3UXVLJO6ECANRVZBNRS2IH/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XQ3NS4IBYE2I3MVMGAHFZBZBIZGHXHT3/"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1023899"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210805-0009/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4929"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
