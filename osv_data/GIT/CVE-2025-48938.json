A security vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 2.12.1 where an attacker-controlled GitHub Enterprise Server could result in executing arbitrary commands on a user's machine by replacing HTTP URLs provided by GitHub with local file paths for browsing. In `2.12.1`, `Browser.Browse()` has been enhanced to allow and disallow a variety of scenarios to avoid opening or executing files on the filesystem without unduly impacting HTTP URLs. No known workarounds are available other than upgrading.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cli/go-gh","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a08820a13f257d6c5b4cb86d37db559ec6d14577"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.11.1","v2.11.2","v2.12.0","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48938.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cli/go-gh/security/advisories/GHSA-g9f5-x53j-h563"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cli/go-gh/commit/a08820a13f257d6c5b4cb86d37db559ec6d14577"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cli/go-gh/blob/61bf393cf4aeea6d00a6251390f5f67f5b67e727/pkg/browser/browser.go"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-501"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:U"}]}
