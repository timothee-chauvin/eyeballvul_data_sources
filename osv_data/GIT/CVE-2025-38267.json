If the reader page is the\nsame as the commit buffer (the buffer that is currently being written to)\nit was assumed that it should never have missed events. If it does, it\ntriggers a WARN_ON_ONCE().\n\nBut there just happens to be one scenario where this can legitimately\nhappen. That is on a commit_overrun. A commit overrun is when an interrupt\npreempts an event being written to the buffer and then the interrupt adds\nso many new events that it fills and wraps the buffer back to the commit.\nAny new events would then be dropped and be reported as \"missed_events\".\n\nIn this case, the next page to read is the commit buffer and after the\nswap of the reader page, the reader page will be the commit buffer, but\nthis time there will be missed events and this triggers the following\nwarning:\n\n ------------[ cut here ]------------\n WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 1127 at kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:7357 ring_buffer_map_get_reader+0x49a/0x780\n Modules linked in: kvm_intel kvm irqbypass\n CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 1127 Comm: trace-cmd Not tainted 6.15.0-rc7-test-00004-g478bc2824b45-dirty #564 PREEMPT\n Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.16.3-debian-1.16.3-2 04/01/2014\n RIP: 0010:ring_buffer_map_get_reader+0x49a/0x780\n Code: 00 00 00 48 89 fe 48 c1 ee 03 80 3c 2e 00 0f 85 ec 01 00 00 4d 3b a6 a8 00 00 00 0f 85 8a fd ff ff 48 85 c0 0f 84 55 fe ff ff <0f> 0b e9 4e fe ff ff be 08 00 00 00 4c 89 54 24 58 48 89 54 24 50\n RSP: 0018:ffff888121787dc0 EFLAGS: 00010002\n RAX: 00000000000006a2 RBX: ffff888100062800 RCX: ffffffff8190cb49\n RDX: ffff888126934c00 RSI: 1ffff11020200a15 RDI: ffff8881010050a8\n RBP: dffffc0000000000 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffed1024d26982\n R10: ffff888126934c17 R11: ffff8881010050a8 R12: ffff888126934c00\n R13: ffff8881010050b8 R14: ffff888101005000 R15: ffff888126930008\n FS:  00007f95c8cd7540(0000) GS:ffff8882b576e000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n CR2: 00007f95c8de4dc0 CR3: 0000000128452002 CR4: 0000000000172ef0\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  ?
