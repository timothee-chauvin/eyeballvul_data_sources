{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-65955","published":"2025-12-02T23:02:58.856Z","modified":"2025-12-14T04:48:43.636368Z","aliases":["GHSA-q3hc-j9x5-mp9m"],"related":["openSUSE-SU-2025:15816-1"],"summary":"ImageMagick has a use-after-free/double-free risk in Options::fontFamily when clearing family","details":"ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. Prior to 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34, there is a vulnerability in ImageMagick’s Magick++ layer that manifests when Options::fontFamily is invoked with an empty string. Clearing a font family calls RelinquishMagickMemory on _drawInfo->font, freeing the font string but leaving _drawInfo->font pointing to freed memory while _drawInfo->family is set to that (now-invalid) pointer. Any later cleanup or reuse of _drawInfo->font re-frees or dereferences dangling memory. DestroyDrawInfo and other setters (Options::font, Image::font) assume _drawInfo->font remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/imagemagick/imagemagick","events":[{"introduced":"e46b7d19de7914881986ef939f690facc7a0198d"},{"fixed":"a90c0505dcb65c8caff3c545be10afea6028ec8f"}]}],"versions":["7.0.1-0","7.0.1-1","7.0.1-10","7.0.1-2","7.0.1-3","7.0.1-4","7.0.1-5","7.0.1-6","7.0.1-7","7.0.1-8","7.0.1-9","7.0.10-0","7.0.10-1","7.0.10-10","7.0.10-11","7.0.10-12","7.0.10-13","7.0.10-14","7.0.10-15","7.0.10-16","7.0.10-17","7.0.10-18","7.0.10-19","7.0.10-2","7.0.10-20","7.0.10-21","7.0.10-22","7.0.10-23","7.0.10-24","7.0.10-25","7.0.10-26","7.0.10-27","7.0.10-28","7.0.10-29","7.0.10-3","7.0.10-30","7.0.10-31","7.0.10-32","7.0.10-33","7.0.10-34","7.0.10-35","7.0.10-36","7.0.10-37","7.0.10-38","7.0.10-39","7.0.10-4","7.0.10-40","7.0.10-41","7.0.10-42","7.0.10-43","7.0.10-44","7.0.10-45","7.0.10-46","7.0.10-47","7.0.10-48","7.0.10-49","7.0.10-5","7.0.10-50","7.0.10-51","7.0.10-52","7.0.10-53","7.0.10-54","7.0.10-55","7.0.10-56","7.0.10-57","7.0.10-58","7.0.10-59","7.0.10-6","7.0.10-60","7.0.10-61","7.0.10-62","7.0.10-7","7.0.10-8","7.0.10-9","7.0.11-0","7.0.11-1","7.0.11-10","7.0.11-11","7.0.11-12","7.0.11-13","7.0.11-14","7.0.11-2","7.0.11-3","7.0.11-4","7.0.11-5","7.0.11-6","7.0.11-7","7.0.11-8","7.0.11-9","7.0.2-0","7.0.2-1","7.0.2-10","7.0.2-2","7.0.2-3","7.0.2-4","7.0.2-5","7.0.2-6","7.0.2-7","7.0.2-8","7.0.2-9","7.0.3-0","7.0.3-1","7.0.3-10","7.0.3-2","7.0.3-3","7.0.3-4","7.0.3-5","7.0.3-6","7.0.3-7","7.0.3-8","7.0.3-9","7.0.4-0","7.0.4-1","7.0.4-10","7.0.4-2","7.0.4-3","7.0.4-4","7.0.4-5","7.0.4-6","7.0.4-7","7.0.4-8","7.0.4-9","7.0.5-0","7.0.5-1","7.0.5-10","7.0.5-2","7.0.5-3","7.0.5-4","7.0.5-5","7.0.5-6","7.0.5-7","7.0.5-8","7.0.5-9","7.0.6-0","7.0.6-1","7.0.6-2","7.0.6-3","7.0.6-4","7.0.6-5","7.0.6-6","7.0.6-7","7.0.6-8","7.0.6-9","7.0.7-0","7.0.7-1","7.0.7-10","7.0.7-11","7.0.7-12","7.0.7-13","7.0.7-14","7.0.7-15","7.0.7-16","7.0.7-17","7.0.7-18","7.0.7-19","7.0.7-2","7.0.7-20","7.0.7-21","7.0.7-22","7.0.7-23","7.0.7-24","7.0.7-25","7.0.7-26","7.0.7-27","7.0.7-28","7.0.7-29","7.0.7-3","7.0.7-30","7.0.7-31","7.0.7-32","7.0.7-33","7.0.7-34","7.0.7-35","7.0.7-36","7.0.7-37","7.0.7-38","7.0.7-39","7.0.7-4","7.0.7-5","7.0.7-6","7.0.7-8","7.0.7-9","7.0.7.7","7.0.8-0","7.0.8-1","7.0.8-10","7.0.8-11","7.0.8-12","7.0.8-13","7.0.8-14","7.0.8-15","7.0.8-16","7.0.8-17","7.0.8-18","7.0.8-19","7.0.8-2","7.0.8-20","7.0.8-21","7.0.8-22","7.0.8-23","7.0.8-24","7.0.8-25","7.0.8-26","7.0.8-27","7.0.8-28","7.0.8-29","7.0.8-3","7.0.8-30","7.0.8-31","7.0.8-32","7.0.8-33","7.0.8-34","7.0.8-35","7.0.8-36","7.0.8-37","7.0.8-38","7.0.8-39","7.0.8-4","7.0.8-40","7.0.8-41","7.0.8-42","7.0.8-43","7.0.8-44","7.0.8-45","7.0.8-46","7.0.8-47","7.0.8-48","7.0.8-49","7.0.8-5","7.0.8-50","7.0.8-51","7.0.8-52","7.0.8-53","7.0.8-54","7.0.8-55","7.0.8-56","7.0.8-57","7.0.8-58","7.0.8-59","7.0.8-6","7.0.8-60","7.0.8-61","7.0.8-62","7.0.8-63","7.0.8-64","7.0.8-65","7.0.8-66","7.0.8-67","7.0.8-68","7.0.8-7","7.0.8-8","7.0.8-9","7.0.9-0","7.0.9-1","7.0.9-10","7.0.9-11","7.0.9-12","7.0.9-13","7.0.9-14","7.0.9-15","7.0.9-16","7.0.9-17","7.0.9-18","7.0.9-19","7.0.9-2","7.0.9-20","7.0.9-21","7.0.9-22","7.0.9-23","7.0.9-24","7.0.9-25","7.0.9-26","7.0.9-27","7.0.9-4","7.0.9-5","7.0.9-6","7.0.9-7","7.0.9-8","7.0.9-9","7.1.0-0","7.1.0-1","7.1.0-10","7.1.0-11","7.1.0-12","7.1.0-13","7.1.0-14","7.1.0-15","7.1.0-16","7.1.0-17","7.1.0-18","7.1.0-19","7.1.0-2","7.1.0-20","7.1.0-21","7.1.0-22","7.1.0-23","7.1.0-24","7.1.0-25","7.1.0-26","7.1.0-27","7.1.0-28","7.1.0-29","7.1.0-3","7.1.0-30","7.1.0-31","7.1.0-32","7.1.0-33","7.1.0-34","7.1.0-35","7.1.0-36","7.1.0-37","7.1.0-38","7.1.0-39","7.1.0-4","7.1.0-40","7.1.0-41","7.1.0-42","7.1.0-43","7.1.0-44","7.1.0-45","7.1.0-46","7.1.0-47","7.1.0-48","7.1.0-49","7.1.0-5","7.1.0-50","7.1.0-51","7.1.0-52","7.1.0-53","7.1.0-54","7.1.0-55","7.1.0-56","7.1.0-57","7.1.0-58","7.1.0-59","7.1.0-6","7.1.0-60","7.1.0-61","7.1.0-62","7.1.0-7","7.1.0-8","7.1.0-9","7.1.1-0","7.1.1-1","7.1.1-10","7.1.1-11","7.1.1-12","7.1.1-13","7.1.1-14","7.1.1-15","7.1.1-16","7.1.1-17","7.1.1-18","7.1.1-19","7.1.1-2","7.1.1-20","7.1.1-21","7.1.1-22","7.1.1-23","7.1.1-24","7.1.1-25","7.1.1-26","7.1.1-27","7.1.1-28","7.1.1-29","7.1.1-3","7.1.1-30","7.1.1-31","7.1.1-32","7.1.1-33","7.1.1-34","7.1.1-35","7.1.1-36","7.1.1-37","7.1.1-38","7.1.1-39","7.1.1-4","7.1.1-40","7.1.1-41","7.1.1-43","7.1.1-44","7.1.1-45","7.1.1-46","7.1.1-47","7.1.1-5","7.1.1-6","7.1.1-7","7.1.1-8","7.1.1-9","7.1.2-0","7.1.2-1","7.1.2-2","7.1.2-3","7.1.2-5","7.1.2-6","7.1.2-7","7.1.2-8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65955.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/65xxx/CVE-2025-65955.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/6409f34d637a34a1c643632aa849371ec8b3b5a8"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/6f81eb15f822ad86e8255be75
