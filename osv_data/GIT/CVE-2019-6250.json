A v2_decoder.cpp zmq::v2_decoder_t::size_ready integer overflow allows an authenticated attacker to overwrite an arbitrary amount of bytes beyond the bounds of a buffer, which can be leveraged to run arbitrary code on the target system. The memory layout allows the attacker to inject OS commands into a data structure located immediately after the problematic buffer (i.e., it is not necessary to use a typical buffer-overflow exploitation technique that changes the flow of control).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2cb1240db64ce1ea299e00474c646a2453a8435b"}]}],"versions":["v3.1.0","v3.2.1","v4.1.0","v4.2.0","v4.2.0-rc1","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.2.3","v4.2.4","v4.2.5","v4.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-6250.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3351"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-22"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4368"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
