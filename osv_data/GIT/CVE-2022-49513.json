{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-49513","published":"2025-02-26T02:13:42.759Z","modified":"2025-11-19T15:42:05.257599Z","related":["SUSE-SU-2025:1293-1"],"summary":"cpufreq: governor: Use kobject release() method to free dbs_data","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncpufreq: governor: Use kobject release() method to free dbs_data\n\nThe struct dbs_data embeds a struct gov_attr_set and\nthe struct gov_attr_set embeds a kobject. Since every kobject must have\na release() method and we can't use kfree() to free it directly,\nso introduce cpufreq_dbs_data_release() to release the dbs_data via\nthe kobject::release() method. This fixes the calltrace like below:\n\n  ODEBUG: free active (active state 0) object type: timer_list hint: delayed_work_timer_fn+0x0/0x34\n  WARNING: CPU: 12 PID: 810 at lib/debugobjects.c:505
