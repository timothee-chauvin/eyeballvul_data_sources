If frags arrive in order,\nthe last frag's reference is reset in:\n\n  inet_frag_reasm_prepare\n    skb_morph\n\nwhich is not straightforward.\n\nHowever when frags arrive out of order, nobody unref the last frag, and\nall frags are leaked. The situation is even worse, as initiating packet\ncapture can lead to a crash[0] when skb has been cloned and shared at the\nsame time.\n\nFix the issue by removing skb_get() before defragmentation. act_ct\nreturns TC_ACT_CONSUMED when defrag failed or in progress.\n\n[0]:\n[  843.804823] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[  843.809659] kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:2091!\n[  843.814516]
