Prior to version `0.6.1`, there is a possible prototype pollution issue for the `MetadataRecord`, when merged with a base class' metadata object, in `meta` decorator from the `@aedart/support` package. The likelihood of exploitation is questionable, given that a class's metadata can only be set or altered when the class is decorated via `meta()`. Furthermore, object(s) of sensitive nature would have to be stored as metadata, before this can lead to a security impact. The issue has been patched in version `0.6.1`.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/aedart/ion","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"211e3ea120a782699ee3d8501a8ba7a283663cca"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-30857.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/aedart/ion/security/advisories/GHSA-wwxh-74fx-33c6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/aedart/ion/commit/c3e2ee08710d4164d796ecb66ed291335dae9291"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1321"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
