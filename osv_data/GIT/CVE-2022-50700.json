{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-50700","published":"2025-12-24T10:55:16.257Z","modified":"2026-01-02T20:55:57.905412Z","summary":"wifi: ath10k: Delay the unmapping of the buffer","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath10k: Delay the unmapping of the buffer\n\nOn WCN3990, we are seeing a rare scenario where copy engine hardware is\nsending a copy complete interrupt to the host driver while still\nprocessing the buffer that the driver has sent, this is leading into an\nSMMU fault triggering kernel panic. This is happening on copy engine\nchannel 3 (CE3) where the driver normally enqueues WMI commands to the\nfirmware. Upon receiving a copy complete interrupt, host driver will\nimmediately unmap and frees the buffer presuming that hardware has\nprocessed the buffer. In the issue case, upon receiving copy complete\ninterrupt, host driver will unmap and free the buffer but since hardware\nis still accessing the buffer (which in this case got unmapped in\nparallel), SMMU hardware will trigger an SMMU fault resulting in a\nkernel panic.\n\nIn order to avoid this, as a work around, add a delay before unmapping\nthe copy engine source DMA buffer. This is conditionally done for\nWCN3990 and only for the CE3 channel where issue is seen.\n\nBelow is the crash signature:\n\nwifi smmu error: kernel: [ 10.120965] arm-smmu 15000000.iommu:
