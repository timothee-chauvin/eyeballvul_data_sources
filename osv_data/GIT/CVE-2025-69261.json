Prior to version 0.16.0-alpha.3, a multiplication in `WasmEdge/include/runtime/instance/memory.h` can wrap, causing `checkAccessBound()` to incorrectly allow the access. This leads to a segmentation fault. Version 0.16.0-alpha.3 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wasmedge/wasmedge","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7d654456d9459a221590427ca6170ac2e8a7de8f"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.10.0","0.10.0-alpha.1","0.10.0-alpha.2","0.10.0-rc.1","0.10.1","0.10.1-alpha.1","0.10.1-alpha.2","0.10.1-alpha.3","0.10.1-rc.1","0.11.0","0.11.0-alpha.1","0.11.0-rc.1","0.11.1","0.11.1-alpha.1","0.11.1-rc.1","0.11.2","0.11.2-alpha.1","0.11.2-rc.1","0.11.2-rc.2","0.11.2-rc.3","0.12.0","0.12.0-alpha.1","0.12.0-alpha.2","0.12.1","0.13.0","0.13.0-alpha.1","0.13.1","0.13.2","0.13.3","0.13.4","0.13.5","0.14.0","0.14.0-alpha.1","0.14.0-alpha.2","0.14.0-alpha.3","0.14.0-alpha.4","0.14.0-rc.1","0.14.0-rc.2","0.14.0-rc.3","0.14.0-rc.4","0.14.0-rc.5","0.14.1","0.14.1-beta.1","0.14.1-beta.2","0.14.1-rc.1","0.14.1-rc.2","0.14.1-rc.3","0.14.1-rc.4","0.14.1-rc.5","0.15.0","0.15.0-alpha.1","0.15.0-alpha.2","0.15.0-alpha.3","0.15.0-alpha.4","0.15.0-rc.1","0.16.0-alpha.1","0.16.0-alpha.2","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.2","0.6.3","0.6.4","0.6.5","0.6.6","0.6.7","0.6.8","0.6.9","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.7.3","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.8.2","0.8.2-rc.1","0.8.2-rc.2","0.8.2-rc.3","0.8.2-rc.4","0.8.2-rc.5","0.9.0","0.9.0-rc.1","0.9.0-rc.2","0.9.0-rc.3","0.9.0-rc.4","0.9.0-rc.5","0.9.1","0.9.1-alpha.1","0.9.1-beta.1","0.9.1-beta.2","0.9.1-rc.1","rust-macro/0.1.0","rust-macro/0.2.0","rust-macro/0.2.1","rust-macro/0.3.0","rust-sdk/0.1.0","rust-sdk/0.2.0","rust-sdk/0.3.0","rust-sdk/0.4.0","rust-sdk/0.5.0","rust-sdk/0.6.0","rust-sdk/0.7.0","rust-sdk/0.8.0","rust-sdk/0.8.1","rust-types/0.1.0","rust-types/0.1.1","rust-types/0.1.2","rust-types/0.1.3","rust-types/0.2.0","rust-types/0.2.1","rust-types/0.3.0","rust-types/0.3.1","rust-types/0.4.1","rust/0.10.0","rust/0.11.0","rust/0.12.0","rust/0.13.1","rust/0.2.1","rust/0.2.2","rust/0.3.0","rust/0.5.0","rust/0.7.0","rust/0.8.0","rust/0.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-69261.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/69xxx/CVE-2025-69261.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/commit/37cc9fa19bd23edbbdaa9252059b17f191fa4d17"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/security/advisories/GHSA-89fm-8mr7-gg4m"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69261"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-190"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/69xxx/CVE-2025-69261.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
