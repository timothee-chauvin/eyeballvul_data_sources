Versions prior to 0.35.0 are subject to a Denial of Service. Users that have permissions to change Flux’s objects, either through a Flux source or directly within a cluster, can provide invalid data to fields `.spec.interval` or `.spec.timeout` (and structured variations of these fields), causing the entire object type to stop being processed. This issue is patched in version 0.35.0. As a workaround, Admission controllers can be employed to restrict the values that can be used for fields `.spec.interval` and `.spec.timeout`, however upgrading to the latest versions is still the recommended mitigation.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller","events":[{"introduced":"8e16bd4c926846959f7996648223d22ef29b6648"},{"fixed":"e3f65fb7bcba07037e88490ad0ad88230e520c5e"}]}],"versions":["api/v0.1.1","api/v0.1.2","api/v0.10.0","api/v0.11.0","api/v0.11.1","api/v0.12.0","api/v0.12.1","api/v0.12.2","api/v0.13.0","api/v0.13.1","api/v0.13.2","api/v0.13.3","api/v0.14.0","api/v0.14.1","api/v0.15.0","api/v0.15.1","api/v0.15.2","api/v0.15.3","api/v0.15.4","api/v0.15.5","api/v0.16.0","api/v0.17.0","api/v0.18.0","api/v0.18.1","api/v0.18.2","api/v0.19.0","api/v0.19.1","api/v0.2.0","api/v0.2.1","api/v0.2.2","api/v0.20.0","api/v0.20.1","api/v0.20.2","api/v0.21.0","api/v0.21.1","api/v0.22.0","api/v0.22.1","api/v0.22.2","api/v0.22.3","api/v0.23.0","api/v0.24.0","api/v0.24.1","api/v0.24.2","api/v0.24.3","api/v0.24.4","api/v0.25.0","api/v0.26.0","api/v0.26.1","api/v0.26.2","api/v0.26.3","api/v0.27.0","api/v0.27.1","api/v0.28.0","api/v0.29.0","api/v0.3.0","api/v0.30.0","api/v0.31.0","api/v0.32.0","api/v0.33.0","api/v0.34.0","api/v0.35.0","api/v0.4.0","api/v0.5.0","api/v0.5.1","api/v0.5.2","api/v0.5.3","api/v0.6.0","api/v0.6.1","api/v0.6.2","api/v0.6.3","api/v0.7.0","api/v0.7.1","api/v0.7.2","api/v0.7.3","api/v0.7.4","api/v0.8.0","api/v0.8.1","api/v0.9.0","api/v0.9.1","api/v0.9.2","api/v0.9.3","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.13.3","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.15.3","v0.15.4","v0.15.5","v0.16.0","v0.17.0","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.19.0","v0.19.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.22.0","v0.22.1","v0.22.2","v0.22.3","v0.23.0","v0.24.0","v0.24.1","v0.24.2","v0.24.3","v0.24.4","v0.25.0","v0.26.0","v0.26.1","v0.26.2","v0.26.3","v0.27.0","v0.27.1","v0.28.0","v0.29.0","v0.3.0","v0.30.0","v0.31.0","v0.32.0","v0.33.0","v0.34.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39272.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller","events":[{"introduced":"a66409c52bcafc8deaa50401b42576c0e562eded"},{"fixed":"42558a438d982faa4ef94dc57c47f5747dc30fcc"}]}],"versions":["api/v0.0.10","api/v0.0.11","api/v0.0.9","api/v0.1.0","api/v0.1.1","api/v0.1.2","api/v0.10.0","api/v0.11.0","api/v0.12.0","api/v0.13.0","api/v0.14.0","api/v0.14.1","api/v0.15.0","api/v0.15.1","api/v0.16.0","api/v0.17.0","api/v0.17.1","api/v0.18.0","api/v0.18.1","api/v0.19.0","api/v0.2.0","api/v0.2.1","api/v0.20.0","api/v0.20.1","api/v0.21.0","api/v0.22.0","api/v0.22.1","api/v0.22.2","api/v0.23.0","api/v0.23.1","api/v0.23.2","api/v0.23.3","api/v0.23.4","api/v0.23.5","api/v0.24.0","api/v0.3.0","api/v0.4.0","api/v0.5.0","api/v0.6.0","api/v0.6.1","api/v0.6.2","api/v0.7.0","api/v0.7.1","api/v0.8.0","api/v0.9.0","v0.0.10","v0.0.11","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.16.0","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.19.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.21.0","v0.22.0","v0.22.1","v0.22.2","v0.23.0","v0.23.1","v0.23.2","v0.23.3","v0.23.4","v0.23.5","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0","v0.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39272.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller","events":[{"introduced":"6966ac06aa105b94767926d3e9561a9dd4966a0e"},{"fixed":"0f91a3298dee56a7934b4fe3e3cea07d1f745391"}]}],"versions":["api/v0.1.1","api/v0.10.0","api/v0.11.0","api/v0.12.0","api/v0.12.1","api/v0.12.2","api/v0.13.0","api/v0.13.1","api/v0.13.2","api/v0.14.0","api/v0.15.0","api/v0.15.1","api/v0.15.2","api/v0.15.3","api/v0.15.4","api/v0.16.0","api/v0.16.1","api/v0.17.0","api/v0.17.1","api/v0.17.2","api/v0.18.0","api/v0.19.0","api/v0.19.1","api/v0.19.2","api/v0.2.0","api/v0.2.1","api/v0.2.2","api/v0.2.3","api/v0.20.0","api/v0.20.1","api/v0.21.0","api/v0.21.1","api/v0.21.2","api/v0.22.0","api/v0.22.1","api/v0.22.2","api/v0.22.3","api/v0.22.4","api/v0.22.5","api/v0.23.0","api/v0.24.0","api/v0.24.1","api/v0.24.2","api/v0.24.3","api/v0.24.4","api/v0.25.0","api/v0.25.1","api/v0.25.2","api/v0.25.3","api/v0.25.4","api/v0.25.5","api/v0.25.6","api/v0.25.7","api/v0.25.8","api/v0.25.9","api/v0.26.0","api/v0.26.1","api/v0.27.0","api/v0.28.0","api/v0.29.0","api/v0.3.0","api/v0.30.0","api/v0.30.1","api/v0.31.0","api/v0.32.0","api/v0.32.1","api/v0.33.0","api/v0.34.0","api/v0.35.0","api/v0.4.0","api/v0.4.1","api/v0.5.0","api/v0.5.1","api/v0.5.2","api/v0.5.3","api/v0.5.4","api/v0.5.5","api/v0.5.6","api/v0.6.0","api/v0.6.
