A heap-based buffer overflow bug in svgpp_agg_render may lead to code execution. In the render_scanlines_aa_solid function, the blend_hline function is called repeatedly multiple times. blend_hline is equivalent to a loop containing write operations. Each call writes a piece of heap data, and multiple calls overwrite the data in the heap.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/svgpp/svgpp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"17e54ff509ae8d9433b9e6d09b9855aac64ded99"}]}],"versions":["v1.2.2","v1.2.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-6247.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00001.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/svgpp/svgpp/issues/70"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
