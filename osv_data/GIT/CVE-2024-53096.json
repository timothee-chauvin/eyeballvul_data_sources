We preallocate memory for the iterator before we call the file-backed\n   memory hook, allowing us to exit early and avoid having to perform\n   complicated and error-prone close/free logic. We carefully free\n   iterator state on both success and error paths.\n\n2. The enclosing mmap_region() function handles the mapping_map_writable()\n   logic early. Previously the logic had the mapping_map_writable() at the\n   point of mapping a newly allocated file-backed VMA, and a matching\n   mapping_unmap_writable() on success and error paths.\n\n   We now do this unconditionally if this is a file-backed, shared writable\n   mapping. If a driver changes the flags to eliminate VM_MAYWRITE, however\n   doing so does not invalidate the seal check we just performed, and we in\n   any case always decrement the counter in the wrapper.\n\n   We perform a debug assert to ensure a driver does not attempt to do the\n   opposite.\n\n3. We also move arch_validate_flags() up into the mmap_region()\n   function. This is only relevant on arm64 and sparc64, and the check is\n   only meaningful for SPARC with ADI enabled. We explicitly add a warning\n   for this arch if a driver invalidates this check, though the code ought\n   eventually to be fixed to eliminate the need for this.\n\nWith all of these measures in place, we no longer need to explicitly close\nthe VMA on error paths, as we place all checks which might fail prior to a\ncall to any driver mmap hook.\n\nThis eliminates an entire class of errors, makes the code easier to reason\nabout and more robust.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a3c08c021778dad30f69895e378843e9f423d734"},{"fixed":"43323a4e5b3f8ccc08e2f835abfdc7ee9da8f6ed"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"43bed0a13a5cdbb314d14f28c2bf2c60eb4e6e1e"},{"fixed":"44f48eb9a6051826227bbd375446064fb2a43c6c"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"deb0f6562884b5b4beb883d73e66a7d3a1b96d99"},{"fixed":"52c81fd0f5a8bf8032687b94ccf00d13b44cc5c8"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"deb0f6562884b5b4beb883d73e66a7d3a1b96d99"},{"fixed":"bdc136e2b05fabcd780fe5f165d154eb779dfcb0"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"deb0f6562884b5b4beb883d73e66a7d3a1b96d99"},{"fixed":"5de195060b2e251a835f622759550e6202167641"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"6757330b1be5b0606125b65ed50caac69bccf9a5"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"66f2ed0172af04a89677ae1898600e1264e25800"}]}],"versions":["v2.6.12","v2.6.12-rc2","v2.6.12-rc3","v2.6.12-rc4","v2.6.12-rc5","v2.6.12-rc6","v2.6.13","v2.6.13-rc1","v2.6.13-rc2","v2.6.13-rc3","v2.6.13-rc4","v2.6.13-rc5","v2.6.13-rc6","v2.6.13-rc7","v2.6.14","v2.6.14-rc1","v2.6.14-rc2","v2.6.14-rc3","v2.6.14-rc4","v2.6.14-rc5","v2.6.15","v2.6.15-rc1","v2.6.15-rc2","v2.6.15-rc3","v2.6.15-rc4","v2.6.15-rc5","v2.6.15-rc6","v2.6.15-rc7","v2.6.16","v2.6.16-rc1","v2.6.16-rc2","v2.6.16-rc3","v2.6.16-rc4","v2.6.16-rc5","v2.6.16-rc6","v2.6.17","v2.6.17-rc1","v2.6.17-rc2","v2.6.17-rc3","v2.6.17-rc4","v2.6.17-rc5","v2.6.17-rc6","v2.6.18","v2.6.18-rc1","v2.6.18-rc2","v2.6.18-rc3","v2.6.18-rc4","v2.6.18-rc5","v2.6.18-rc6","v2.6.18-rc7","v2.6.19","v2.6.19-rc1","v2.6.19-rc2","v2.6.19-rc3","v2.6.19-rc4","v2.6.19-rc5","v2.6.19-rc6","v2.6.20","v2.6.20-rc1","v2.6.20-rc2","v2.6.20-rc3","v2.6.20-rc4","v2.6.20-rc5","v2.6.20-rc6","v2.6.20-rc7","v2.6.21","v2.6.21-rc1","v2.6.21-rc2","v2.6.21-rc3","v2.6.21-rc4","v2.6.21-rc5","v2.6.21-rc6","v2.6.21-rc7","v2.6.22","v2.6.22-rc1","v2.6.22-rc2","v2.6.22-rc3","v2.6.22-rc4","v2.6.22-rc5","v2.6.22-rc6","v2.6.22-rc7","v2.6.23","v2.6.23-rc1","v2.6.23-rc2","v2.6.23-rc3","v2.6.23-rc4","v2.6.23-rc5","v2.6.23-rc6","v2.6.23-rc7","v2.6.23-rc8","v2.6.23-rc9","v2.6.24","v2.6.24-rc1","v2.6.24-rc2","v2.6.24-rc3","v2.6.24-rc4","v2.6.24-rc5","v2.6.24-rc6","v2.6.24-rc7","v2.6.24-rc8","v2.6.25","v2.6.25-rc1","v2.6.25-rc2","v2.6.25-rc3","v2.6.25-rc4","v2.6.25-rc5","v2.6.25-rc6","v2.6.25-rc7","v2.6.25-rc8","v2.6.25-rc9","v2.6.26","v2.6.26-rc1","v2.6.26-rc2","v2.6.26-rc3","v2.6.26-rc4","v2.6.26-rc5","v2.6.26-rc6","v2.6.26-rc7","v2.6.26-rc8","v2.6.26-rc9","v2.6.27","v2.6.27-rc1","v2.6.27-rc2","v2.6.27-rc3","v2.6.27-rc4","v2.6.27-rc5","v2.6.27-rc6","v2.6.27-rc7","v2.6.27-rc8","v2.6.27-rc9","v2.6.28","v2.6.28-rc1","v2.6.28-rc2","v2.6.28-rc3","v2.6.28-rc4","v2.6.28-rc5","v2.6.28-rc6","v2.6.28-rc7","v2.6.28-rc8","v2.6.28-rc9","v2.6.29","v2.6.29-rc1","v2.6.29-rc2","v2.6.29-rc3","v2.6.29-rc4","v2.6.29-rc5","v2.6.29-rc6","v2.6.29-rc7","v2.6.29-rc8","v2.6.30","v2.6.30-rc1","v2.6.30-rc2","v2.6.30-rc3","v2.6.30-rc4","v2.6.30-rc5","v2.6.30-rc6","v2.6.30-rc7","v2.6.30-rc8","v2.6.31","v2.6.31-rc1","v2.6.31-rc2","v2.6.31-rc3","v2.6.31-rc4","v2.6.31-rc5","v2.6.31-rc6","v2.6.31-rc7","v2.6.31-rc8","v2.6.31-rc9","v2.6.32","v2.6.32-rc1","v2.6.32-rc2","v2.6.32-rc3","v2.6.32-rc4","v2.6.32-rc5","v2.6.32-rc6","v2.6.32-rc7","v2.6.32-rc8","v2.6.33","v2.6.33-rc1","v2.6.33-rc2","v2.6.33-rc3","v2.6.33-rc4","v2.6.33-rc5","v2.6.33-rc6","v2.6.33-rc7","v2.6.33-rc8","v2.6.34","v2.6.34-rc1","v2.6.34-rc2","v2.6.34-rc3","v2.6.34-rc4","v2.6.34-rc5","v2.6.34-rc6","v2.6.34-rc7","v2.6.35","v2.6.35-rc1","v2.6.35-rc2","v2.6.35-rc3","v2.6.35-rc4","v2.6.35-rc5","v2.6.35-rc6","v2.6.36","v2.6.36-rc1","v2.6.36-rc2","v2.6.36-rc3","v2.6.36-rc4","v2.6.36-rc5","v2.6.36-rc6","v2.6.36-rc7","v2.6.36-rc8","v2.6.37","v2.6.37-rc1","v2.6.37-rc2","v2.6.37-rc3","v2.6.37-rc4","v2.6.37-rc5","v2.6.37-rc6","v2.6.37-rc7","v2.6.37-rc8","v2.6.38","v2.6.38-rc1","v2.6.38-rc2","v2.6.38-rc3","v2.6.38-rc4","v2.6.38-rc5","v2.6.38-rc6","v2.6.38-rc7","v2.6.38-rc8","v2.6.39","v2.6.39-rc1","v2.6.39-rc2","v2.6.39-rc3","v2.6.39-rc4","v2.6.39-rc5","v2.6.39-rc6","v2.6.39-rc7","v3.0","v3.0-rc1","v3.0-rc2","v3.0-rc3","v3.0-rc4","v3.0-rc5","v3.0-rc6","v3.0-rc7","v3.1","v3.1-rc1","v3.1-rc10","v3.1-rc2","v3.1-rc3","v3.1-rc4","v3.1-rc5","v3.1-rc6","v3.1-rc7","v3.1-rc8","v3.1-rc9","v3.10","v3.10-rc1","v3.10-rc2","v3.10-rc3","v3.10-rc4","v3.10-rc5","v3.10-rc6","v3.10-rc7","v3.11","v3.11-rc1","v3.11-rc2","v3.11-rc3","v3.11-rc4
