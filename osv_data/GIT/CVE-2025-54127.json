In versions 11.0.6 and below, the NodeJS version of HAXcms uses an insecure default configuration designed for local development. The default configuration does not perform authorization or authentication checks. If a user were to deploy haxcms-nodejs without modifying the default settings, ‘HAXCMS_DISABLE_JWT_CHECKS‘ would be set to ‘true‘ and their deployment would lack session authentication. This is fixed in version 11.0.7.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ddd93fe352363b7b191a969a58f7cdd06e918024"}]}],"versions":["10.0.0","v0.0.10","v0.0.11","v0.0.12","v0.0.13","v0.0.14","v0.0.15","v0.0.16","v0.0.17","v0.0.18","v0.0.19","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9","v10.0.1","v10.0.2","v10.0.3","v10.0.4","v10.0.5","v10.0.6","v11.0.0","v11.0.1","v11.0.2","v11.0.3","v11.0.4","v11.0.5","v11.0.6","v9.0.0","v9.0.0-alpha.0","v9.0.0-alpha.1","v9.0.1","v9.0.10","v9.0.11","v9.0.12","v9.0.13","v9.0.14","v9.0.15","v9.0.16","v9.0.17","v9.0.18","v9.0.19","v9.0.2","v9.0.20","v9.0.21","v9.0.3","v9.0.4","v9.0.5","v9.0.6","v9.0.7","v9.0.8","v9.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54127.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/security/advisories/GHSA-f38f-jvqj-mfg6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1188"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
