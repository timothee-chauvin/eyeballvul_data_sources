In\nthis process, tag_ops->disconnect(ds) was made to be called only from\nswitch.c (cross-chip notifiers emitted as a result of dynamic tag proto\nchanges), but the normal driver teardown code path wasn't replaced with\nanything.\n\nSolve this problem by adding a function that does the opposite of\ndsa_switch_setup_tag_protocol(), which is called from the equivalent\nspot in dsa_switch_teardown(). The positioning here also ensures that we\nwon't have any use-after-free in tagging protocol (*rcv) ops, since the\nteardown sequence is as follows:\n\ndsa_tree_teardown\n-> dsa_tree_teardown_master\n   -> dsa_master_teardown\n      -> unsets master->dsa_ptr, making no further packets match the\n         ETH_P_XDSA packet type handler\n-> dsa_tree_teardown_ports\n   -> dsa_port_teardown\n      -> dsa_slave_destroy\n         -> unregisters DSA net devices, there is even a synchronize_net()\n            in unregister_netdevice_many()\n-> dsa_tree_teardown_switches\n   -> dsa_switch_teardown\n      -> dsa_switch_teardown_tag_protocol\n         -> finally frees the tagger-owned storage","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"7f2973149c22e7a6fee4c0c9fa6b8e4108e9c208"},{"fixed":"5809fb03942dbac25144db5bebea84fa003ecaca"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"7f2973149c22e7a6fee4c0c9fa6b8e4108e9c208"},{"fixed":"4e0c19fcb8b5323716140fa82b79aa9f60e60407"}]}],"versions":["v5.16","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.0.6","v6.0.7","v6.0.8","v6.0.9","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49808.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49808.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4e0c19fcb8b5323716140fa82b79aa9f60e60407"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5809fb03942dbac25144db5bebea84fa003ecaca"}]}
