{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-31078","published":"2022-07-11T20:25:09Z","modified":"2025-11-19T11:03:35.733257Z","aliases":["GHSA-qpx3-9565-5xwm","GO-2022-0510"],"summary":"KubeEdge CloudCore Router memory exhaustion","details":"KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the router switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ecca82fd5d0b0891dbd562f4d4349443d958b9df"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.4"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge","events":[{"introduced":"3803951602f938d9d90d74957eb0fbc238142101"},{"fixed":"27a6957ee7685884a7d9b3d87c13f61625cb3bc9"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.10.0"},{"fixed":"1.10.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"24b146e19e8b8d9171851673ff60162711ac71c9"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"= 1.11.0"}]}}],"versions":["v0.1","v0.2","v0.2.1","v0.3.0-beta.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0-beta.0","v1.10.0","v1.10.0-beta.0","v1.10.1","v1.11.0","v1.11.0-alpha.0","v1.11.0-beta.0","v1.2.0-beta.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-alpha.0","v1.3.0-beta.0","v1.4.0-alpha.0","v1.4.0-beta.0","v1.5.0-beta.0","v1.6.0-beta.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-beta.0","v1.8.0-beta.0","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-beta.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31078.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/advisories/GHSA-qpx3-9565-5xwm"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
