{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-67726","published":"2025-12-12T06:13:51.336Z","modified":"2025-12-14T04:47:35.265202Z","aliases":["GHSA-jhmp-mqwm-3gq8"],"summary":"Tornado is Vulnerable to Quadratic DoS via Crafted Multipart Parameters","details":"Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. Versions 6.5.2 and below use an inefficient algorithm when parsing parameters for HTTP header values, potentially causing a DoS. The _parseparam function in httputil.py is used to parse specific HTTP header values, such as those in multipart/form-data and repeatedly calls string.count() within a nested loop while processing quoted semicolons. If an attacker sends a request with a large number of maliciously crafted parameters in a Content-Disposition header, the server's CPU usage increases quadratically (O(n²)) during parsing. Due to Tornado's single event loop architecture, a single malicious request can cause the entire server to become unresponsive for an extended period. This issue is fixed in version 6.5.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"38014ddb51520ff7762c1d55535925dba2cdbe31"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.2.0","v3.2.0b1","v3.2.0b2","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v4.0.0","v4.0.0b1","v4.0.0b2","v4.0.0b3","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.1.0","v4.1.0b1","v4.1.0b2","v4.2.0","v4.2.0b1","v4.2.1","v4.3.0","v4.3.0b1","v4.3.0b2","v4.4.0","v4.4.0b1","v4.4.1","v4.4.2","v4.4.3","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.5.2","v4.5.3","v5.0.0","v5.0.1","v5.1.0","v5.1.0b1","v6.0.0","v6.0.0b1","v6.1.0","v6.1.0b1","v6.1.0b2","v6.2.0","v6.2.0b1","v6.2.0b2","v6.3.0","v6.3.0b1","v6.3.1","v6.4.0","v6.4.0b1","v6.4.1","v6.5.0","v6.5.0b1","v6.5.1","v6.5.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67726.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67726.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/commit/771472cfdaeebc0d89a9cc46e249f8891a6b29cd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/releases/tag/v6.5.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/security/advisories/GHSA-jhmp-mqwm-3gq8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67726"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-400","CWE-834"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67726.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
