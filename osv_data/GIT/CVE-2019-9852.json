Protection was added, to address CVE-2018-16858, to avoid a directory traversal attack where scripts in arbitrary locations on the file system could be executed. However this new protection could be bypassed by a URL encoding attack. In the fixed versions, the parsed url describing the script location is correctly encoded before further processing. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/libreoffice/core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7c4bdddf82580ab62e442ff6497af92e69fddd5e"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-9852.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00006.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00067.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/10/msg00005.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Aug/28"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Sep/17"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4102-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4501"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/CVE-2019-9852"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PMEGUWMWORC3DOVEHVXLFT3A5RSCMLBH/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
