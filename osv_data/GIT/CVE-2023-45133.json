{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-45133","published":"2023-10-12T16:17:08.624Z","modified":"2025-12-05T00:08:34.165358Z","aliases":["GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92"],"related":["openSUSE-SU-2024:13360-1","openSUSE-SU-2025:14663-1"],"summary":"Babel vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when compiling specifically crafted malicious code","details":"Babel is a compiler for writingJavaScript. In `@babel/traverse` prior to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse`, using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any \"polyfill provider\" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`. No other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be. Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2` and `@babel/traverse@8.0.0-alpha.4`. Those who cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above should upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions: `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2, `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2, `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/babel/babel","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b4b9942a6cde0685c222eb3412347880aae40ad5"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.23.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/babel/babel","events":[{"introduced":"bdbaca37bf5ec7fb879e729b39d48673f45842f3"},{"fixed":"9944f3680434d6e7c67cd1fe065abef5885c9290"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"8.0.0-alpha.0"},{"fixed":"8.0.0-alpha.4"}]}}],"versions":["babel-eslint-v11.0.0-beta.1","v1.10.1","v1.10.10","v1.10.11","v1.10.12","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.10.5","v1.10.6","v1.10.7","v1.10.8","v1.10.9","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.10","v1.11.11","v1.11.12","v1.11.13","v1.11.14","v1.11.15","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.11.4","v1.11.5","v1.11.6","v1.11.7","v1.11.8","v1.11.9","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.10","v1.12.11","v1.12.12","v1.12.13","v1.12.14","v1.12.15","v1.12.16","v1.12.17","v1.12.18","v1.12.19","v1.12.2","v1.12.20","v1.12.21","v1.12.22","v1.12.23","v1.12.24","v1.12.25","v1.12.26","v1.12.3","v1.12.4","v1.12.5","v1.12.6","v1.12.7","v1.12.8","v1.12.9","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.10","v1.13.11","v1.13.12","v1.13.13","v1.13.2","v1.13.3","v1.13.4","v1.13.5","v1.13.6","v1.13.7","v1.13.8","v1.13.9","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.14.10","v1.14.11","v1.14.12","v1.14.13","v1.14.14","v1.14.15","v1.14.16","v1.14.17","v1.14.2","v1.14.3","v1.14.4","v1.14.5","v1.14.6","v1.14.7","v1.14.8","v1.14.9","v1.15.0","v1.7.10","v1.7.11","v1.7.12","v1.7.13","v1.7.14","v1.7.15","v1.7.16","v1.7.17","v1.7.7","v1.7.9","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v1.9.6","v1.9.7","v1.9.8","v1.9.9","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.1.0","v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.11.0","v2.11.1","v2.11.2","v2.11.3","v2.11.4","v2.12.0","v2.12.1","v2.12.2","v2.12.3","v2.12.4","v2.12.5","v2.12.6","v2.13.0","v2.13.1","v2.13.2","v2.13.3","v2.13.4","v2.13.5","v2.13.6","v2.13.7","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.10","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.5","v2.4.6","v2.4.7","v2.4.8","v2.4.9","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.6.3","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.7.2","v2.7.3","v2.7.4","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v2.9.2","v2.9.3","v2.9.4","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.10","v3.0.11","v3.0.12","v3.0.13","v3.0.14","v3.0.15","v3.0.16","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.0.8","v3.0.9","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.10","v3.3.11","v3.3.12","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.3.4","v3.3.5","v3.3.7","v3.3.8","v3.3.9","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.5.3","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.6.2","v3.6.3","v3.6.4","v3.6.5","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.1.1","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.3.0","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.4.2","v4.4.3","v4.4.4","v4.4.5","v4.4.6","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.5.2","v4.5.3","v4.5.4","v4.5.5","v4.6.0","v4.6.1","v4.6.2","v4.6.3","v4.6.4","v4.6.5","v4.6.6","v4.7.0","v4.7.1","v4.7.10","v4.7.11","v4.7.12","v4.7.13","v4.7.14","v4.7.15","v4.7.16","v4.7.2","v4.7.3","v4.7.4","v4.7.5","v4.7.6","v4.7.7","v4.7.8","v4.7.9","v5.0.0","v5.0.0-beta1","v5.0.0-beta2","v5.0.0-beta3","v5.0.0-beta4","v5.0.1","v5.0.10","v5.0.11","v5.0.12","v5.0.13","v5.0.2","v5.0.3","v5.0.4","v5.0.5","v5.0.6","v5.0.7","v5.0.8","v5.0.9","v5.1.0","v5.1.1","v5.1.10","v5.1.11","v5.1.12","v5.1.13","v5.1.2","v5.1.3","v5.1.4","v5.1.5","v5.1.6","v5.1.7","v5.1.8","v5.1.9","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.2.10","v5.2.11","v5.2.12","v5.2.13","v5.2.14","v5.2.15","v5.2.16","v5.2.17","v5.2.2","v5.2.3","v5.2.4","v5.2.5","v5.2.6","v5.2.7","v5.2.8","v5.2.9","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.3.3","v5.4.0","v5.4.1","v5.4.2","v5.4.3","v5.4.4","v5.4.5","v5.4.6","v5.4.7","v5.5.0","v5.5.1","v5.5.2","v5.5.3","v5.5.4","v5.5.5","v5.5.6","v5.5.7","v5.5.8","v5.6.0","v5.6.1","v5.6.10","v5.6.11","v5.6.12","v5.6.13","v5.6.14","v5.6.15","v5.6.16","v5.6.17","v5.6.18","v5.6.19","v5.6.2","v5.6.20","v5.6.21","v5.6.23","v5.6.3","v5.6.4","v5.6.5","v5.6.6","v5.6.7","v5.6.8","v5.6.9","v5.7.0","v5.7.1","v5.7.2","v5.7.3","v5.7.4","v5.7.5","v5.7.6","v5.8.0","v5.8.1","v5.8.10","v5.8.11","v5.8.12","v5.8.13","v5.8.14","v5.8.15","v5.8.16","v5.8.17","v5.8.18","v5.8.19","v5.8.2","v5.8.20","v5.8.21","v5.8.22","v5.8.23","v5.8.24","v5.8.25","v5.8.26","v5.8.27","v5.8.28","v5.8.29","v5.8.3","v5.8.30","v5.8.31","v5.8.32","v5.8.33","v5.8.4","v5.8.5","v5.8.6","v5.8.7","v5.8.8","v5.8.9","v6.0.1","v6.0.10","v6.0.11","v6.0.12","v6.0.13","v6.0.14","v6.0.15","v6.0.16","v6.0.17","v6.0.18","v6.0.19","v6.0.2","v6.0.20","v6.0.5","v6.0.6","v6.0.7","v6.0.8","v6.0.9","v6.1.0","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.10.0","v6.10.1","v6.10.2","v6.10.3","v6.10.4","v6.11.0","v6.11.1","v6.11.2","v6.11.3","v6.11.4","v6.11.5","v6.11.6","v6.12.0","v6.13.0","v6.13.1","v6.13.2","v6.14.0","v6.15.0","v6.16.0","v6.16.1","v6.16.2","v6.16.3","v6.17.0","v6.18.0
