When that happens, any access to msk->first will cause an UaF\naccess, as the subflow cleanup did not cleared such field in the mptcp\nsocket.\n\nAddress the issue explicitly traversing the listener socket accept\nqueue at close time and performing the needed cleanup on the pending\nmsk.\n\nNote that the locking is a bit tricky, as we need to acquire the msk\nsocket lock, while still owning the subflow socket one.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"86e39e04482b0aadf3ee3ed5fcf2d63816559d36"},{"fixed":"a8a3e95c74e48c2c9b07b81fafda9122993f2e12"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"86e39e04482b0aadf3ee3ed5fcf2d63816559d36"},{"fixed":"6aeed9045071f2252ff4e98fc13d1e304f33e5b0"}]}],"versions":["v5.16","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.18.1","v5.18.2","v5.18.3","v5.18.4","v5.18.5","v5.18.6","v5.18.7","v5.18.8","v5.18.9","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49669.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"5.18.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49669.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6aeed9045071f2252ff4e98fc13d1e304f33e5b0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a8a3e95c74e48c2c9b07b81fafda9122993f2e12"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
