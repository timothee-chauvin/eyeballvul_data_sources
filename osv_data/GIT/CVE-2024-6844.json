{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-6844","published":"2025-03-20T10:15:34Z","modified":"2025-11-05T11:10:07.772644Z","aliases":["GHSA-8vgw-p6qm-5gr7"],"related":["CGA-7q88-2g87-5c94","CGA-prgw-64rx-hr6v"],"details":"A vulnerability in corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.0.1 allows for inconsistent CORS matching due to the handling of the '+' character in URL paths. The request.path is passed through the unquote_plus function, which converts the '+' character to a space ' '. This behavior leads to incorrect path normalization, causing potential mismatches in CORS configuration. As a result, endpoints may not be matched correctly to their CORS settings, leading to unexpected CORS policy application. This can cause unauthorized cross-origin access or block valid requests, creating security vulnerabilities and usability issues.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/corydolphin/flask-cors","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1df178ccc019c5aa7282246288c04f867d716790"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.10.3","1.8.1","1.9.0","2.0.0","2.0.0rc1","2.0.1","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.1.3","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.10","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","3.0.8","3.0.9","3.1.01","4.0.0","4.0.1","v1.1","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-6844.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/731a6cd4-d05f-4fe6-8f5b-fe088d7b34e0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/05/msg00049.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
