Due to an Uncontrolled Recursion bug in versions 2.6 through 2.7.STABLE9, versions 3.1 through 5.9, and versions 6.0.1 through 6.5, Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP Request parsing. This problem allows a remote client to perform Denial of Service attack by sending a large X-Forwarded-For header when the follow_x_forwarded_for feature is configured. This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.6. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/squid-cache/squid","events":[{"introduced":"f188960023551b2e9cb2a9df245b92bfeef37056"},{"last_affected":"20d1c7236c7493b1f8b7e47f2e2afc529232071c"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.1"},{"last_affected":"5.9"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/squid-cache/squid","events":[{"introduced":"ef1e128ce5a9733ae57d6595806bb832de389446"},{"fixed":"e8118a7381213f5cfcdeb4cec1d2d854bfd261c8"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"6.0.1"},{"fixed":"6.6"}]}}],"versions":["M-staged-PR161","M-staged-PR164","M-staged-PR170","M-staged-PR176","M-staged-PR179","M-staged-PR181","M-staged-PR182","M-staged-PR186","M-staged-PR189","M-staged-PR193","M-staged-PR195","M-staged-PR196","M-staged-PR198","M-staged-PR199","M-staged-PR200","M-staged-PR202","M-staged-PR206","M-staged-PR208","M-staged-PR209","M-staged-PR210","M-staged-PR218","M-staged-PR220","M-staged-PR221","M-staged-PR225","M-staged-PR227","M-staged-PR229","M-staged-PR230","M-staged-PR235","M-staged-PR237","M-staged-PR238","M-staged-PR239","M-staged-PR241","M-staged-PR242","M-staged-PR252","M-staged-PR255","M-staged-PR258","M-staged-PR264","M-staged-PR266","M-staged-PR267","M-staged-PR268","M-staged-PR274","M-staged-PR276","M-staged-PR293","M-staged-PR294","M-staged-PR295","M-staged-PR299","M-staged-PR306","M-staged-PR314","M-staged-PR319","M-staged-PR342","M-staged-PR345","M-staged-PR348","M-staged-PR351","M-staged-PR359","M-staged-PR364","M-staged-PR365","M-staged-PR366","M-staged-PR370","M-staged-PR372","M-staged-PR373","M-staged-PR375","M-staged-PR376","SQUID_3_5_27","SQUID_4_0_1","SQUID_4_0_10","SQUID_4_0_11","SQUID_4_0_12","SQUID_4_0_13","SQUID_4_0_14","SQUID_4_0_15","SQUID_4_0_16","SQUID_4_0_2","SQUID_4_0_3","SQUID_4_0_4","SQUID_4_0_5","SQUID_4_0_6","SQUID_4_0_7","SQUID_4_0_8","SQUID_4_0_9","SQUID_5_0_1","SQUID_5_0_2","SQUID_5_0_3","SQUID_5_0_4","SQUID_5_0_5","SQUID_5_0_6","SQUID_5_0_7","SQUID_5_1","SQUID_5_2","SQUID_5_3","SQUID_5_4_1","SQUID_5_5","SQUID_5_6","SQUID_5_7","SQUID_5_8","SQUID_5_9","SQUID_6_0_1","SQUID_6_0_2","SQUID_6_0_3","SQUID_6_1","SQUID_6_2","SQUID_6_3","SQUID_6_4","SQUID_6_5","merge-candidate-3-v1","merge-candidate-3-v2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-50269.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/SQUID-2023_10.patch"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v6/SQUID-2023_10.patch"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/50xxx/CVE-2023-50269.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-wgq4-4cfg-c4x3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00003.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5QASTMCUSUEW3UOMKHZJB3FTONWSRXS/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MEV66D3PAAY6K7TWDT3WZBLCPLASFJDC/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50269"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240119-0005/"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-674"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/50xxx/CVE-2023-50269.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
