{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-22482","published":"2023-01-25T18:25:15.287Z","modified":"2025-12-04T23:37:42.439739Z","aliases":["GHSA-q9hr-j4rf-8fjc","GO-2023-1520"],"summary":"JWT audience claim is not verified","details":"Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Versions of Argo CD starting with v1.8.2 and prior to 2.3.13, 2.4.19, 2.5.6, and 2.6.0-rc-3  are vulnerable to an improper authorization bug causing the API to accept certain invalid tokens. OIDC providers include an `aud` (audience) claim in signed tokens. The value of that claim specifies the intended audience(s) of the token (i.e. the service or services which are meant to accept the token). Argo CD _does_ validate that the token was signed by Argo CD's configured OIDC provider. But Argo CD _does not_ validate the audience claim, so it will accept tokens that are not intended for Argo CD. If Argo CD's configured OIDC provider also serves other audiences (for example, a file storage service), then Argo CD will accept a token intended for one of those other audiences. Argo CD will grant the user privileges based on the token's `groups` claim, even though those groups were not intended to be used by Argo CD. This bug also increases the impact of a stolen token. If an attacker steals a valid token for a different audience, they can use it to access Argo CD. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in versions 2.6.0-rc3, 2.5.6, 2.4.19, and 2.3.13. There are no workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd","events":[{"introduced":"94017f2c8d97588d4aa2213713a71d51005ed62d"},{"fixed":"eb7b8a47908e01f032a29a16eae782dac6702638"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.8.2"},{"fixed":"2.3.13"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd","events":[{"introduced":"d8f845a1263dd6d01ee3073a5ba168d7522648e3"},{"fixed":"0ba9817cc2cfe31668e734ee8c2d4a7c132ce3b0"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.4.0-rc1"},{"fixed":"2.4.19"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd","events":[{"introduced":"2bf51f401d6700f8e8b9565d9fc3f66dcf60a0b6"},{"fixed":"9db2c9471f6ff599c3f630b446e940d3a065620b"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.5.0-rc1"},{"fixed":"2.5.6"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd","events":[{"introduced":"81e40d53fe8eee50b00ab38c4b07b34b3dcd6d25"},{"fixed":"e51d0b3224038e9c38450672173774767e9a5b71"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.6.0-rc1"},{"fixed":"2.6.0-rc3"}]}}],"versions":["v2.4.0","v2.4.0-rc1","v2.4.0-rc2","v2.4.0-rc3","v2.4.0-rc4","v2.4.0-rc5","v2.4.1","v2.4.10","v2.4.11","v2.4.12","v2.4.13","v2.4.14","v2.4.15","v2.4.16","v2.4.17","v2.4.18","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.5","v2.4.6","v2.4.7","v2.4.8","v2.4.9","v2.5.0","v2.5.0-rc1","v2.5.0-rc2","v2.5.0-rc3","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v2.5.3","v2.5.4","v2.5.5","v2.6.0-rc1","v2.6.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-22482.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/22xxx/CVE-2023-22482.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-q9hr-j4rf-8fjc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22482"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-863"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/22xxx/CVE-2023-22482.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
