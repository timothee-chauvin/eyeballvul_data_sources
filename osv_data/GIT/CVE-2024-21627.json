{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-21627","published":"2024-01-02T21:03:17.816Z","modified":"2025-12-05T03:11:55.367454Z","aliases":["BIT-prestashop-2024-21627","GHSA-xgpm-q3mq-46rq"],"summary":"Some attribute not escaped in Validate::isCleanHTML method","details":"PrestaShop is an open-source e-commerce platform. Prior to versions 8.1.3 and 1.7.8.11, some event attributes are not detected by the `isCleanHTML` method. Some modules using the `isCleanHTML` method could be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Versions 8.1.3 and 1.7.8.11 contain a patch for this issue. The best workaround is to use the `HTMLPurifier` library to sanitize html input coming from users. The library is already available as a dependency in the PrestaShop project. Beware though that in legacy object models, fields of `HTML` type will call `isCleanHTML`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/prestashop/prestashop","events":[{"introduced":"ca9d81aae0bb17f3e767bb5d835348ed144a3ab5"},{"fixed":"67fc1aedf438639f41207f5f728046f92865e532"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"8.0.0"},{"fixed":"8.1.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/prestashop/prestashop","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0a0b7c83f3ae4fbbc1aca0ac94332ec3184101f7"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.8.11"}]}}],"versions":["1.5.3.0","1.5.4.1","1.5.6.0","1.5.6.1","1.5.6.2","1.6.0.1","1.6.0.11","1.6.0.12","1.6.0.13","1.6.0.14","1.6.0.2","1.6.0.3","1.6.0.4","1.6.0.5","1.6.0.6","1.6.0.7","1.6.0.8","1.6.0.9","1.6.1.0","1.6.1.1","1.6.1.2-RC3","1.7.0.0","1.7.0.0-beta.1.0","1.7.0.0-beta.2.0","1.7.0.0-beta.3.0","1.7.0.0-beta.4.0","1.7.0.0-rc.0.0","1.7.0.1","1.7.0.2","1.7.0.3","1.7.0.4","1.7.0.5","1.7.0.6","1.7.1.0","1.7.1.1","1.7.1.2","1.7.2.0","1.7.2.0-rc.1.0","1.7.2.1","1.7.2.2","1.7.2.3","1.7.2.4","1.7.3.0","1.7.3.1","1.7.3.2","1.7.3.3","1.7.3.4","1.7.4.0","1.7.4.1","1.7.4.2","1.7.4.3","1.7.5.0","1.7.5.0-rc.1","1.7.5.1","1.7.6.0","1.7.6.0-beta.1","1.7.6.0-rc.1","1.7.6.0-rc.2","1.7.6.1","1.7.6.2","1.7.6.3","1.7.6.4","1.7.6.5","1.7.6.6","1.7.6.7","1.7.6.8","1.7.6.9","1.7.7.0","1.7.7.0-beta.1","1.7.7.0-beta.2","1.7.7.0-rc.1","1.7.7.1","1.7.7.2","1.7.7.3","1.7.7.4","1.7.7.5","1.7.7.6","1.7.7.7","1.7.7.8","1.7.8.0","1.7.8.0-beta.1","1.7.8.0-rc.1","1.7.8.1","1.7.8.10","1.7.8.2","1.7.8.3","1.7.8.4","1.7.8.5","1.7.8.6","1.7.8.7","1.7.8.8","1.7.8.9","8.0.0","8.0.1","8.0.2","8.0.3","8.0.4","8.0.5","8.1.0","8.1.0-beta.1","8.1.0-rc.1","8.1.1","8.1.2","show"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-21627.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/21xxx/CVE-2024-21627.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/73cfb44666818eefd501b526a894fe884dd12129"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/ba06d18466df5b92cb841d504cc7210121104883"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-xgpm-q3mq-46rq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21627"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-20","CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/21xxx/CVE-2024-21627.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
