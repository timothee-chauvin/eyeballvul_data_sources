Starting in version 3.3.8, a security check that gets called after GraphQl resolvers is always replaced by another one as there's no break in a clause. As this falls back to `security`, the impact is there only when there's only a security after resolver and none inside security. Version 3.3.15 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/api-platform/core","events":[{"introduced":"0792141f3fda46babc59c73893491d8f0e5e1105"},{"fixed":"406285383ddcab5db56825fc054ca4ba65691ff6"}]}],"versions":["v3.2.26","v3.3.10","v3.3.11","v3.3.12","v3.3.14","v3.3.8","v3.3.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-23204.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/api-platform/core/commit/dc4fc84ba93e22b4f44a37e90a93c6d079c1c620"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/api-platform/core/pull/6444"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/api-platform/core/pull/6444/files#diff-09e3c2cfe12a2ce65bd6c983c7ca6bfcf783f852b8d0554bb938e8ebf5e5fa65R56"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/api-platform/core/security/advisories/GHSA-7mxx-3cgm-xxv3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/soyuka/core/blob/7e2e8f9ff322ac5f6eb5f65baf432bffdca0fd51/src/Symfony/Security/State/AccessCheckerProvider.php#L49-L57"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
