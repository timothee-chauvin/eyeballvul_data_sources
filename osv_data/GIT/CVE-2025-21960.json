bnxt: do not update checksum in bnxt_xdp_build_skb()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\neth: bnxt: do not update checksum in bnxt_xdp_build_skb()\n\nThe bnxt_rx_pkt() updates ip_summed value at the end if checksum offload\nis enabled.\nWhen the XDP-MB program is attached and it returns XDP_PASS, the\nbnxt_xdp_build_skb() is called to update skb_shared_info.\nThe main purpose of bnxt_xdp_build_skb() is to update skb_shared_info,\nbut it updates ip_summed value too if checksum offload is enabled.\nThis is actually duplicate work.\n\nWhen the bnxt_rx_pkt() updates ip_summed value, it checks if ip_summed\nis CHECKSUM_NONE or not.\nIt means that ip_summed should be CHECKSUM_NONE at this moment.\nBut ip_summed may already be updated to CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY in the\nXDP-MB-PASS path.\nSo the by skb_checksum_none_assert() WARNS about it.\n\nThis is duplicate work and updating ip_summed in the\nbnxt_xdp_build_skb() is not needed.\n\nSplat looks like:\nWARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 5782 at ./include/linux/skbuff.h:5155 bnxt_rx_pkt+0x479b/0x7610 [bnxt_en]\nModules linked in: bnxt_re bnxt_en rdma_ucm rdma_cm iw_cm ib_cm ib_uverbs
