The vucc_details_ajax function in application/controllers/Awards.php does not properly sanitize the user-supplied Gridsquare POST parameter. This allows a remote, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands by injecting a malicious payload, which is then concatenated directly into a raw SQL query in the vucc_qso_details function.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/magicbug/cloudlog","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"32505c176def94a843397422dd27b7b343cfbbb8"}]}],"versions":["1.9","1.9.1","1.9.2","1.9.9","2.0","2.1","2.2","2.3","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.3.3","2.4","2.4.1","2.4.10","2.4.11","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","2.4.5","2.4.6","2.4.7","2.4.8","2.4.9","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.10","2.6.11","2.6.12","2.6.13","2.6.14","2.6.15","2.6.16","2.6.17","2.6.18","2.6.19","2.6.2","2.6.20","2.6.21","2.6.22","2.6.3","2.6.4","2.6.5","2.6.6","2.6.7","2.6.8","2.6.9","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.7.2","2.7.3","2.7.4","2.7.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64084.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/XY20130630/Cloudlog/security/advisories/GHSA-4r9r-3r3q-jg44"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog/releases/tag/2.7.6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog/commit/72a8c3d705c8629f60f64da9f37968417c980242"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
