Because of that, it was possible for a logged in user to modify primary group name with elements of JavaScript. Such script could then be executed in user browser on subsequent requests on pages where primary group name was displayed. This is vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.20.0.5646. Users who are unable to upgrade may modify ttUser.class.php to use an additional call to htmlspecialchars when printing group name.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/anuko/timetracker","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6aaad31630500d13b6c8459daa9f406fd5eb4330"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24708.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/24xxx/CVE-2022-24708.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/commit/6aaad31630500d13b6c8459daa9f406fd5eb4330"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/security/advisories/GHSA-rgcm-xgvj-5mqh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24708"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/24xxx/CVE-2022-24708.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
