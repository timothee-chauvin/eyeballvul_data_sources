{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-66631","published":"2025-12-09T03:18:37.698Z","modified":"2025-12-09T19:46:22.568667Z","aliases":["GHSA-wq34-7f4g-953v"],"summary":"CSLA .NET is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via WcfProxy","details":"CSLA .NET is a framework designed for the development of reusable, object-oriented business layers for applications. Versions 5.5.4 and below allow the use of WcfProxy. WcfProxy uses the now-obsolete NetDataContractSerializer (NDCS) and is vulnerable to remote code execution during deserialization. This vulnerability is fixed in version 6.0.0. To workaround this issue, remove the WcfProxy in data portal configurations.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/marimerllc/csla","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d7fc086befc168c8fd1ef8e0aa676b95640103d3"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.0"}]}}],"versions":["4.5.500","4.5.501","4.5.681","4.5.700","V1-51","V2-0-0","V2-0-begin","V2-1-4","V3-0-5","V4-0-0","V4-1-0","V4-2-0","V4-3-10","V4-5-10","V4-5-12","V4-5-13","V4-5-14","V4-5-15","V4-5-20","V4-5-begin","V4.5.30","V4.5.40","v4.5.600","v4.5.601","v4.6.001","v4.6.100","v4.6.200","v4.6.300","v4.6.400","v4.6.500","v4.6.600","v4.6.601","v4.6.602","v4.6.603","v4.7.100","v4.7.101","v4.7.200","v4.8.0","v4.8.1","v4.8.1.1","v4.9.0","v5.0.0","v5.0.1","v5.1.0","v5.2.0","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66631.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66631.json"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/issues/4001"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/pull/4018"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/security/advisories/GHSA-wq34-7f4g-953v"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66631"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66631.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
