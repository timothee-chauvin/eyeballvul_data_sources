  "details": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It's possible to break many translations coming from wiki pages by creating a corrupted document containing a translation object. This will lead to a broken page. The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.1, 14.4.8, and 13.10.11. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds other than fixing any way to create a document that fail to load.",
