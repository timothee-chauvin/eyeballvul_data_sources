Note that this occurs\nafter certificate chain signature verification and requires either a\nCA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to\ncontinue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path\nto a trusted issuer.\n\nThe read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to\na denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure\nof private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext)\nalthough we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory\ncontents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory.\n\nIn a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious\nserver. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests\nclient authentication and a malicious client connects.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openssl/openssl","events":[{"introduced":"89cd17a031e022211684eb7eb41190cf1910f9fa"},{"fixed":"31157bc0b46e04227b8468d3e6915e4d0332777c"}]}],"versions":["openssl-3.0.0","openssl-3.0.1","openssl-3.0.2","openssl-3.0.3","openssl-3.0.4","openssl-3.0.5","openssl-3.0.6","openssl-3.0.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-4203.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=c927a3492698c254637da836762f9b1f86cffabc"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
