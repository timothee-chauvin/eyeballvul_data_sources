Prior to commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b, any user with an account on an instance of `effectindex/tripreporter`, e.g. `subjective.report`, may be affected by an improper password verification vulnerability. The vulnerability allows any user with a password matching the password requirements to log in as any user. This allows access to accounts / data loss of the user. This issue is patched in commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b. No action necessary for users of `subjective.report`, and anyone running their own instance should update to this commit or newer as soon as possible. As a workaround, someone running their own instance may apply the patch manually.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/effectindex/tripreporter","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-31123.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/effectindex/tripreporter/commit/bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/effectindex/tripreporter/security/advisories/GHSA-356r-rwp8-h6m6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
