Untrusted filesystem paths could bypass the sandbox and access devices through those special device filenames with superscript digits, and through them provide access peripheral devices connected to the computer, or network resources mapped to those devices. This can include modems, printers, network printers, and any other device connected to a serial or parallel port, including emulated USB serial ports. The bug is fixed in #371, which is published in cap-primitives 3.4.1, cap-std 3.4.1, and cap-async-std 3.4.1. There are no known workarounds for this issue. Affected Windows users are recommended to upgrade.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c461c0799f831df5d8ca2e121b7f541d9e8143af"}]}],"versions":["cap-async-std-v0.10.0","cap-async-std-v0.11.0","cap-async-std-v0.12.0","cap-async-std-v0.13.0","cap-async-std-v0.13.10","cap-async-std-v0.13.2","cap-async-std-v0.13.3","cap-async-std-v0.13.4","cap-async-std-v0.13.6","cap-async-std-v0.13.7","cap-async-std-v0.13.9","cap-async-std-v0.14.0","cap-async-std-v0.14.1","cap-async-std-v0.15.0","cap-async-std-v0.15.1","cap-async-std-v0.15.2","cap-async-std-v0.16.3","cap-async-std-v0.17.0","cap-async-std-v0.18.0","cap-async-std-v0.18.1","cap-async-std-v0.19.0","cap-async-std-v0.19.1","cap-async-std-v0.2.0","cap-async-std-v0.20.0","cap-async-std-v0.21.0","cap-async-std-v0.21.1","cap-async-std-v0.22.0","cap-async-std-v0.22.1","cap-async-std-v0.23.0","cap-async-std-v0.23.1","cap-async-std-v0.24.0","cap-async-std-v0.24.1","cap-async-std-v0.24.2","cap-async-std-v0.24.3","cap-async-std-v0.24.4","cap-async-std-v0.25.0","cap-async-std-v0.25.1","cap-async-std-v0.25.2","cap-async-std-v0.4.0","cap-async-std-v0.5.0","cap-async-std-v0.7.0","cap-async-std-v0.8.0","cap-async-std-v3.4.0","cap-dir-ext-v0.3.0","cap-dir-ext-v0.4.0","cap-dir-ext-v0.5.0","cap-directories-v0.10.0","cap-directories-v0.11.0","cap-directories-v0.12.0","cap-directories-v0.13.0","cap-directories-v0.13.10","cap-directories-v0.13.2","cap-directories-v0.13.4","cap-directories-v0.13.6","cap-directories-v0.13.7","cap-directories-v0.13.9","cap-directories-v0.14.0","cap-directories-v0.14.1","cap-directories-v0.15.0","cap-directories-v0.15.1","cap-directories-v0.15.2","cap-directories-v0.16.0","cap-directories-v0.16.1","cap-directories-v0.16.3","cap-directories-v0.17.0","cap-directories-v0.18.0","cap-directories-v0.18.1","cap-directories-v0.19.0","cap-directories-v0.19.1","cap-directories-v0.2.0","cap-directories-v0.20.0","cap-directories-v0.21.0","cap-directories-v0.21.1","cap-directories-v0.22.0","cap-directories-v0.22.1","cap-directories-v0.23.0","cap-directories-v0.23.1","cap-directories-v0.24.0","cap-directories-v0.24.1","cap-directories-v0.24.2","cap-directories-v0.24.3","cap-directories-v0.24.4","cap-directories-v0.25.0","cap-directories-v0.25.1","cap-directories-v0.25.2","cap-directories-v0.3.0","cap-directories-v0.4.0","cap-directories-v0.5.0","cap-directories-v0.7.0","cap-directories-v0.8.0","cap-directories-v0.9.0","cap-directories-v1.0.0","cap-directories-v1.0.0-rc1","cap-directories-v1.0.0-rc2","cap-directories-v1.0.1","cap-directories-v1.0.10","cap-directories-v1.0.11","cap-directories-v1.0.12","cap-directories-v1.0.13","cap-directories-v1.0.14","cap-directories-v1.0.15","cap-directories-v1.0.16","cap-directories-v1.0.2","cap-directories-v1.0.3","cap-directories-v1.0.4","cap-directories-v1.0.5","cap-directories-v2.0.0","cap-directories-v3.0.0","cap-directories-v3.1.0","cap-directories-v3.2.0","cap-directories-v3.3.0","cap-directories-v3.4.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.10.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.11.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.12.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.13.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.13.10","cap-fs-ext-v0.13.2","cap-fs-ext-v0.13.3","cap-fs-ext-v0.13.4","cap-fs-ext-v0.13.6","cap-fs-ext-v0.13.7","cap-fs-ext-v0.13.9","cap-fs-ext-v0.14.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.14.1","cap-fs-ext-v0.15.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.15.1","cap-fs-ext-v0.15.2","cap-fs-ext-v0.16.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.16.1","cap-fs-ext-v0.16.3","cap-fs-ext-v0.17.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.18.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.18.1","cap-fs-ext-v0.19.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.19.1","cap-fs-ext-v0.20.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.21.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.21.1","cap-fs-ext-v0.22.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.22.1","cap-fs-ext-v0.23.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.23.1","cap-fs-ext-v0.24.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.24.1","cap-fs-ext-v0.24.2","cap-fs-ext-v0.24.3","cap-fs-ext-v0.24.4","cap-fs-ext-v0.25.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.25.1","cap-fs-ext-v0.25.2","cap-fs-ext-v0.7.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.8.0","cap-fs-ext-v0.9.0","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.0","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.0-rc1","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.0-rc2","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.1","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.10","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.11","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.12","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.13","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.14","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.15","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.16","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.2","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.3","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.4","cap-fs-ext-v1.0.5","cap-fs-ext-v2.0.0","cap-fs-ext-v3.0.0","cap-fs-ext-v3.1.0","cap-fs-ext-v3.2.0","cap-fs-ext-v3.3.0","cap-fs-ext-v3.4.0","cap-net-ext-v1.0.11","cap-net-ext-v1.0.12","cap-net-ext-v1.0.13","cap-net-ext-v1.0.14","cap-net-ext-v1.0.15","cap-net-ext-v1.0.16","cap-net-ext-v2.0.0","cap-net-ext-v3.0.0","cap-net-ext-v3.1.0","cap-net-ext-v3.2.0","cap-net-ext-v3.3.0","cap-net-ext-v3.4.0","cap-primitives-v0.10.0","cap-primitives-v0.12.1","cap-primitives-v0.13.0","cap-primitives-v0.13.1","cap-primitives-v0.13.10","cap-primitives-v0.13.7","cap-primitives-v0.13.9","cap-primitives-v0.14.1","cap-primitives-v0.15.0","cap-primitives-v0.15.2","cap-primitives-v0.16.3","cap-primitives-v0.17.0","cap-primitives-v0.18.0","cap-primitives-v0.18.1","cap-primitives-v0.19.0","cap-primitives-v0.19.1","cap-primitives-v0.2.0","cap-primit
