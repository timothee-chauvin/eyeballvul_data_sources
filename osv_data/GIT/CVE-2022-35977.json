Authenticated users issuing specially crafted `SETRANGE` and `SORT(_RO)` commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting with Redis attempting to allocate impossible amounts of memory and abort with an out-of-memory (OOM) panic. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.8, 6.2.9 and 6.0.17. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/redis/redis","events":[{"introduced":"d375595d5e3ae2e5c29e6c00a2dc3d60578fd9fc"},{"fixed":"1c75ab062d0cb1f3af57e39a399325b9e917e85f"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"7.0"},{"fixed":"7.0.8"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/redis/redis","events":[{"introduced":"445aa844b946a8f1bc21ac8554b44adb1ecb4018"},{"fixed":"137696d80811c25b918f7f543bcbe8c9c142f49d"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"6.2"},{"fixed":"6.2.9"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/redis/redis","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6ed4dc5052488ba88d2b759d494b2d8083a46206"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.17"}]}}],"versions":["1.3.6","2.2-alpha0","2.2-alpha1","2.2-alpha2","2.2-alpha3","2.2-alpha4","2.2-alpha5","2.2-alpha6","2.2.0-rc1","2.3-alpha0","3.0-alpha0","6.0-rc1","6.0-rc2","6.0-rc3","6.0-rc4","6.0.0","6.0.1","6.0.10","6.0.11","6.0.12","6.0.13","6.0.14","6.0.15","6.0.16","6.0.2","6.0.3","6.0.4","6.0.5","6.0.6","6.0.7","6.0.8","6.0.9","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.2.2","6.2.3","6.2.4","6.2.5","6.2.6","6.2.7","6.2.8","7.0.0","7.0.1","7.0.2","7.0.3","7.0.4","7.0.5","7.0.6","7.0.7","v1.3.10","v1.3.11","v1.3.12","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v2.0.0-rc1","v2.1.1-watch","vm-playpen","with-deprecated-diskstore"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35977.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/1ec82e6e97e1db06a72ca505f9fbf6b981f31ef7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.0.17"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.2.9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.0.8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-mrcw-fhw9-fj8j"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00031.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-190"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
