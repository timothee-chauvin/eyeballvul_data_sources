When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/python/cpython","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5c17dfc5d70ce88be99bc5769b91ce79d7a90d61"},{"fixed":"c9f07813ab8e664d8c34413c4fc2d4f86c061a92"},{"fixed":"d0d4d30882fe3ab9b1badbecf5d15d94326fd13e"},{"fixed":"e3110c3cfbb7daa690d54d0eff6c264c870a71bf"},{"fixed":"fcbe0cb04d35189401c0c880ebfb4311e952d776"}]}],"versions":["2.5","3.2","v0.9.8","v0.9.9","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1","v1.1.1","v1.2","v1.2b1","v1.2b2","v1.2b3","v1.2b4","v1.3","v1.3b1","v1.4","v1.4b1","v1.4b2","v1.4b3","v1.5","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.2a1","v1.5.2a2","v1.5.2b1","v1.5.2b2","v1.5.2c1","v1.5a1","v1.5a2","v1.5a3","v1.5a4","v1.5b1","v1.5b2","v1.6a1","v1.6a2","v2.0","v2.0b1","v2.0b2","v2.0c1","v2.1","v2.1a1","v2.1a2","v2.1b1","v2.1b2","v2.1c1","v2.1c2","v2.2a3","v2.3c1","v2.3c2","v2.4","v2.4a1","v2.4a2","v2.4a3","v2.4b1","v2.4b2","v2.4c1","v2.5","v2.5.1","v2.5.1c1","v2.5.2","v2.5.2c1","v2.5.3","v2.5.3c1","v2.5.4","v2.5.5","v2.5.5c1","v2.5.5c2","v2.5.6","v2.5.6c1","v2.5a0","v2.5a1","v2.5a2","v2.5b1","v2.5b2","v2.5b3","v2.5c1","v2.5c2","v2.6","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.6.2c1","v2.6.3","v2.6.3rc1","v2.6.4","v2.6.4rc1","v2.6.4rc2","v2.6.5","v2.6.5rc1","v2.6.5rc2","v2.6.6","v2.6.6rc1","v2.6.6rc2","v2.6.7","v2.6.8","v2.6.8rc1","v2.6.8rc2","v2.6a1","v2.6a2","v2.6a3","v2.6b1","v2.6b2","v2.6b3","v2.6rc1","v2.6rc2","v2.7","v2.7.1","v2.7.1rc1","v2.7.2","v2.7.2rc1","v2.7.3","v2.7.3rc1","v2.7.3rc2","v2.7.4rc1","v2.7a1","v2.7a2","v2.7a3","v2.7a4","v2.7b1","v2.7b2","v2.7rc1","v2.7rc2","v3.0a1","v3.0a2","v3.0a3","v3.0a4","v3.0a5","v3.0b1","v3.0b2","v3.0b3","v3.0rc1","v3.0rc2","v3.0rc3","v3.1","v3.1.1","v3.1.1rc1","v3.1.2","v3.1.2rc1","v3.1.3","v3.1.3rc1","v3.1.4","v3.1.4rc1","v3.1.5","v3.1.5rc1","v3.1.5rc2","v3.10.0a1","v3.10.0a2","v3.10.0a3","v3.10.0a4","v3.10.0a5","v3.1a1","v3.1a2","v3.1b1","v3.1rc1","v3.1rc2","v3.2","v3.2.1","v3.2.1b1","v3.2.1rc1","v3.2.1rc2","v3.2.2","v3.2.2rc1","v3.2.3","v3.2.3rc1","v3.2.3rc2","v3.2.4","v3.2.4rc1","v3.2.5","v3.2.6","v3.2.6rc1","v3.2a1","v3.2a2","v3.2a3","v3.2a4","v3.2b1","v3.2b2","v3.2rc1","v3.2rc2","v3.2rc3","v3.3.0","v3.3.0a1","v3.3.0a2","v3.3.0a3","v3.3.0a4","v3.3.0b1","v3.3.0b2","v3.3.0rc1","v3.3.0rc2","v3.3.0rc3","v3.3.1","v3.3.1rc1","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.3.3rc1","v3.3.3rc2","v3.3.4","v3.3.4rc1","v3.3.5","v3.3.5rc1","v3.3.5rc2","v3.3.6","v3.3.6rc1","v3.4.0","v3.4.0a1","v3.4.0a2","v3.4.0a3","v3.4.0a4","v3.4.0b1","v3.4.0b2","v3.4.0b3","v3.4.0rc1","v3.4.0rc2","v3.4.0rc3","v3.4.1","v3.4.1rc1","v3.4.2","v3.4.2rc1","v3.4.3","v3.4.3rc1","v3.4.4","v3.4.4rc1","v3.4.5","v3.4.5rc1","v3.4.6","v3.4.6rc1","v3.5.0","v3.5.0a1","v3.5.0a2","v3.5.0a3","v3.5.0a4","v3.5.0b1","v3.5.0b2","v3.5.0b3","v3.5.0b4","v3.5.0rc1","v3.5.0rc2","v3.5.0rc3","v3.5.0rc4","v3.5.1","v3.5.1rc1","v3.5.2","v3.5.2rc1","v3.5.3","v3.5.3rc1","v3.6.0","v3.6.0a1","v3.6.0a2","v3.6.0a3","v3.6.0a4","v3.6.0b1","v3.6.0b2","v3.6.0b3","v3.6.0b4","v3.6.0rc1","v3.6.0rc2","v3.7.0a1","v3.7.0a2","v3.7.0a3","v3.7.0a4","v3.8.0a1","v3.8.0a2","v3.8.0a3","v3.8.0a4","v3.8.0b1","v3.9.0","v3.9.0a1","v3.9.0a2","v3.9.0a3","v3.9.0a4","v3.9.0a5","v3.9.0a6","v3.9.0b1","v3.9.0b2","v3.9.0b3","v3.9.0b4","v3.9.0b5","v3.9.0rc1","v3.9.0rc2","v3.9.1","v3.9.1rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/psf/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/python/PSF-2021-1.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-UPSTREAM-PYTHONCPYTHON-1074933"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugs.python.org/issue42967"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://snyk.io/blog/cache-poisoning-in-popular-open-source-packages/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[]}}
