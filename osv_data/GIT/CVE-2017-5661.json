The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including confidential or sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/xmlgraphics-fop","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"43933a18291fc2e7092e1bd535f59d8f0890a2fc"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-5661.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3864"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/security.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97947"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-14"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
