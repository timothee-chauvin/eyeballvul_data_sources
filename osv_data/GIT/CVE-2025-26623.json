{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-26623","published":"2025-02-18T19:24:31.701Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:34:13.776207Z","aliases":["GHSA-38h4-fx85-qcx7"],"related":["ALSA-2025:7457"],"summary":"Use After Free in Exiv2","details":"Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.28.0 to v0.28.4. Versions prior to v0.28.0, such as v0.27.7, are **not** affected. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fixiso`. The bug is fixed in version v0.28.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/exiv2/exiv2","events":[{"introduced":"931a40a746f5678dcc4625b06a2eb25fa4f00b34"},{"fixed":"907169fa643c2c74c14fd4106e55eaeee3634d9f"}]}],"versions":["v0.28.0","v0.28.1","v0.28.2","v0.28.3","v0.28.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-26623.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/3168"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-38h4-fx85-qcx7"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-416"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
