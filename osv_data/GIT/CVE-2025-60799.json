The application allows unauthorized manipulation of session variables by accepting user-controlled parameters ('subject', 'server', 'database', 'queryid') without proper validation or access control checks. Attackers can exploit this to store arbitrary SQL queries in $_SESSION['sqlquery'] by manipulating these parameters, potentially leading to session poisoning, stored cross-site scripting, or unauthorized access to sensitive session data.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/phppgadmin/phppgadmin","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"13f3f821e6891ae2093e6b66ce190353624886ce"}]}],"versions":["REL_0-5-0","REL_0-6-0","REL_0-6-5","REL_3-0-0-DEV-1","REL_3-0-0-DEV-2","REL_3-0-0-DEV-3","REL_3-0-0-DEV-4","REL_3-0-BETA-1","REL_3-0-RC-1","REL_3-0-RC-2","REL_3-1-BETA-1","REL_3-1-RC-1","REL_4-1-BETA-1","REL_4-2-BETA-1","REL_4-2-BETA-2","REL_5-0-BETA-1","REL_5-0-BETA-2","REL_5-1-0","REL_5-6-0","REL_7-12-1","REL_7-13-0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-60799.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/phppgadmin/phppgadmin/blob/master/sql.php#L68-L76"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pr0wl1ng/security-advisories/blob/main/CVE-2025-60799.md"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
