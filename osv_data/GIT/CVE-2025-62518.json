Versions of astral-tokio-tar prior to 0.5.6 contain a boundary parsing vulnerability that allows attackers to smuggle additional archive entries by exploiting inconsistent PAX/ustar header handling. When processing archives with PAX-extended headers containing size overrides, the parser incorrectly advances stream position based on ustar header size (often zero) instead of the PAX-specified size, causing it to interpret file content as legitimate tar headers. This issue has been patched in version 0.5.6. There are no workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/astral-sh/tokio-tar","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ae1fc1d484f5dd8aecdca7ec7643b43b86faddf1"}]}],"versions":["9b5e692","b1e6022","ba2b140","c06006a","efeaea9","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v5.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62518.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://edera.dev/stories/tarmageddon"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/astral-sh/tokio-tar/commit/22b3f884adb7a2adf1d3a8d03469533f5cbc8318"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/astral-sh/tokio-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-j5gw-2vrg-8fgx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/security/advisories/GHSA-w476-p2h3-79g9"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/edera-dev/cve-tarmageddon"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-843"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
