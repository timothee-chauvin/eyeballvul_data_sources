Versions prior to 0.1.6 are missing `marshal` and `types` from the block list of unsafe module imports. Fickling started blocking both modules to address this issue. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious pickle file that can bypass fickling since it misses detections for `types.FunctionType` and `marshal.loads`. A user who deserializes such a file, believing it to be safe, would inadvertently execute arbitrary code on their system. This impacts any user or system that uses Fickling to vet pickle files for security issues. The issue was fixed in version 0.1.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8249522c7180c69436516ff81bff394f62298c0c"}]}],"versions":["master","v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67747.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67747.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/commit/4e34561301bda1450268d1d7b0b2b151de33b913"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/pull/186"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/releases/tag/v0.1.6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/security/advisories/GHSA-565g-hwwr-4pp3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67747"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-184","CWE-502"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67747.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
