However just after the queue was stopped, an in-flight\nibmvnic_complete_tx() could have restarted the queue even as the reset is\nprogressing.\n\nSince the queue was restarted we could get a call to ibmvnic_xmit() which\ncan then access the bad tx_scrq (or other fields).\n\nWe cannot however simply have ibmvnic_complete_tx() check the ->resetting\nbit and skip starting the queue. This can race at the \"back-end\" of a good\nreset which just restarted the queue but has not cleared the ->resetting\nbit yet. If we skip restarting the queue due to ->resetting being true,\nthe queue would remain stopped indefinitely potentially leading to transmit\ntimeouts.\n\nIOW ->resetting is too broad for this purpose. Instead use a new flag\nthat indicates whether or not the queues are active. Only the open/\nreset paths control when the queues are active. ibmvnic_complete_tx()\nand others wake up the queue only if the queue is marked active.\n\nSo we will have:\n\tA. reset/open thread in ibmvnic_cleanup() and __ibmvnic_open()\n\n\t\t->resetting = true\n\t\t->tx_queues_active = false\n\t\tdisable tx queues\n\t\t...\n\t\t->tx_queues_active = true\n\t\tstart tx queues\n\n\tB. Tx interrupt in ibmvnic_complete_tx():\n\n\t\tif (->tx_queues_active)\n\t\t\tnetif_wake_subqueue();\n\nTo ensure that ->tx_queues_active and state of the queues are consistent,\nwe need a lock which:\n\n\t- must also be taken in the interrupt path (ibmvnic_complete_tx())\n\t- shared across the multiple\n---truncated---","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"7ed5b31f4a6695a21f617df07646e9b15c6c1d29"},{"fixed":"1bd58abf595b6cf1ba6dd47ec887c4c009155fc9"},{"fixed":"475f9cce98b63bc145b4efa66fa51175d4cb345f"},{"fixed":"8507c6ade73cdbbbda5c3d31d67f52f2e1cf03fe"},{"fixed":"4219196d1f662cb10a462eb9e076633a3fc31a15"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.4","v5.15.5","v5.15.6","v5.15.7","v5.15.8","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.16.1","v5.16.10","v5.16.11","v5.16.12","v5.16.13","v5.16.14","v5.16.15","v5.16.16","v5.16.17","v5.16.18","v5.16.2","v5.16.3","v5.16.4","v5.16.5","v5.16.6","v5.16.7","v5.16.8","v5.16.9","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.17.1","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49201.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.4.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.33"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.16.19"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"5.17.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49201.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1bd58abf595b6cf1ba6dd47ec887c4c009155fc9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4219196d1f662cb10a462eb9e076633a3fc31a15"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/475f9cce98b63bc145b4efa66fa51175d4cb345f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8507c6ade73cdbbbda5c3d31d67f52f2e1cf03fe"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49201.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49201"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49201.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
