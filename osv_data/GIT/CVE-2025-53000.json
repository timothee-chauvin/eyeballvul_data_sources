{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-53000","published":"2025-12-17T20:27:59.578Z","modified":"2026-01-04T05:42:52.504978Z","aliases":["GHSA-xm59-rqc7-hhvf"],"summary":"nbconvert has an uncontrolled search path that leads to unauthorized code execution on Windows","details":"The nbconvert tool, jupyter nbconvert, converts Jupyter notebooks to various other formats via Jinja templates. Versions of nbconvert up to and including 7.16.6 on Windows have a vulnerability in which converting a notebook containing SVG output to a PDF results in unauthorized code execution. Specifically, a third party can create a `inkscape.bat` file that defines a Windows batch script, capable of arbitrary code execution. When a user runs `jupyter nbconvert --to pdf` on a notebook containing SVG output to a PDF on a Windows platform from this directory, the `inkscape.bat` file is run unexpectedly. As of time of publication, no known patches exist.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2ba58585f649c1a2024aadd58007ec138457cc58"}]}],"versions":["4.0.0","4.1.0","4.2.0","4.3.0","5.0.0","5.1","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.2.1","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.4","5.4.1","5.5","5.5.0","5.6.0","5.6.1","6.0.0","6.0.0a0","6.0.0a1","6.0.0a2","6.0.0a3","6.0.0a4","6.0.0a5","6.0.0a6","6.0.0b7","6.0.0rc0","6.0.1","6.0.2","6.0.3","6.0.4","6.0.5","6.0.7","6.1.0","6.1.0rc0","6.1.1b0","6.2.0","6.2.0rc0","6.2.0rc1","6.2.0rc2","6.3.0","6.3.0b0","6.4.0","6.4.1","6.4.2","6.4.3","6.4.4","6.4.5","6.5","6.5.0","7.0.0","7.0.0rc0","7.0.0rc1","7.0.0rc2","7.0.0rc3","7.1.0","v7.10.0","v7.11.0","v7.12.0","v7.13.0","v7.13.1","v7.14.0","v7.14.1","v7.14.2","v7.15.0","v7.16.0","v7.16.1","v7.16.2","v7.16.3","v7.16.4","v7.16.5","v7.16.6","v7.2.0","v7.2.1","v7.2.10","v7.2.2","v7.2.3","v7.2.4","v7.2.5","v7.2.6","v7.2.7","v7.2.8","v7.2.9","v7.3.0","v7.3.1","v7.4.0","v7.5.0","v7.6.0","v7.7.0","v7.7.1","v7.7.2","v7.7.3","v7.7.4","v7.8.0","v7.9.0","v7.9.1","v7.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53000.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/53xxx/CVE-2025-53000.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53000"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://www.imperva.com/blog/code-execution-in-jupyter-notebook-exports"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-427"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/53xxx/CVE-2025-53000.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
