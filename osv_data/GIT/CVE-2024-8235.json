A refactor of the code fetching the list of interfaces for multiple APIs introduced a corner case on platforms where allocating 0 bytes of memory results in a NULL pointer. This corner case would lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and subsequent crash of virtinterfaced. This issue could allow clients connecting to the read-only socket to crash the virtinterfaced daemon.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/libvirt/libvirt","events":[{"introduced":"ccd9e99e5299977b2e5432d3ee96138c83ea77be"},{"fixed":"7d72b18017a8173b7d359025d7aeff4f4e527099"}]}],"versions":["v10.4.0","v10.5.0","v10.5.0-rc1","v10.5.0-rc2","v10.6.0","v10.6.0-rc1","v10.7.0-rc1","v10.7.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-8235.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9128"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-8235"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2308680"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://lists.libvirt.org/archives/list/devel@lists.libvirt.org/thread/X6WOVCL6QF3FQRFIIXL736RFZVSUWLWJ/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240920-0006/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
