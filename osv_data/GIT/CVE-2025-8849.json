{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-8849","published":"2025-10-31T00:15:37Z","modified":"2025-11-06T01:21:17.751981Z","details":"LibreChat version 0.7.9 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to unbounded parameter values in the `/api/memories` endpoint. The `key` and `value` parameters accept arbitrarily large inputs without proper validation, leading to a null pointer error in the Rust-based backend when excessively large values are submitted. This results in the inability to create new memories, impacting the stability of the service.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/danny-avila/librechat","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"edf33bedcbb08c33e59df76f06454ed7efd896f9"}]}],"versions":["librechat-1.8.9","v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.3","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.4.8","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.5.7","v0.5.8","v0.5.9","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.10","v0.6.5","v0.6.6","v0.6.9","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.3-rc","v0.7.3-rc2","v0.7.4","v0.7.4-rc1","v0.7.5","v0.7.5-rc1","v0.7.5-rc2","v0.7.6","v0.7.6-rc1","v0.7.7","v0.7.7-rc1","v0.7.8","v0.7.8-rc1","v0.7.9","v0.7.9-rc1","v0.8.0-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-8849.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/danny-avila/librechat/commit/edf33bedcbb08c33e59df76f06454ed7efd896f9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/e9d9404c-cd19-4226-a580-9cba14b7d7d6"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"}]}
