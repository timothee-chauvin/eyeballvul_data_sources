A \"Load YAML\" string or file (aka load_yaml or load_yamlf) can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution because load is used where safe_load should have been used. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/owlmixin","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5d0575303f6df869a515ced4285f24ba721e0d4e"}]}],"versions":["0.2.0","0.2.1","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.6.0","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.8.0","1.0.0","1.0.0a1","1.0.0a2","1.0.0b1","1.0.0b2","1.0.0b3","1.0.0b4","1.0.0b5","1.0.0b6","1.0.0b7","1.0.0rc1","1.0.0rc10","1.0.0rc11","1.0.0rc12","1.0.0rc13","1.0.0rc14","1.0.0rc15","1.0.0rc16","1.0.0rc2","1.0.0rc3","1.0.0rc4","1.0.0rc5","1.0.0rc6","1.0.0rc7","1.0.0rc8","1.0.0rc9","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.2.0a1","2.0.0a1","2.0.0a10","2.0.0a11","2.0.0a2","2.0.0a3","2.0.0a4","2.0.0a5","2.0.0a6","2.0.0a7","2.0.0a8","2.0.0a9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-16618.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/owlmixin/commit/5d0575303f6df869a515ced4285f24ba721e0d4e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/owlmixin/issues/12"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://joel-malwarebenchmark.github.io/blog/2017/11/08/cve-2017-16618-convert-through-owlmixin/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
