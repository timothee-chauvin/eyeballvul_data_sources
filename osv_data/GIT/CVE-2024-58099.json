While the passed buf_size is\ncorrect (xdpf->len), the dma_addr needs to have a dynamic offset which\ncan be calculated as xdpf->data - (void *)xdpf, that is, xdp->data -\nxdp->data_hard_start.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"54f00cce11786742bd11e5e68c3bf85e6dc048c9"},{"fixed":"59ba6cdadb9c26b606a365eb9c9b25eb2052622d"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"54f00cce11786742bd11e5e68c3bf85e6dc048c9"},{"fixed":"f82eb34fb59a8fb96c19f4f492c20eb774140bb5"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"54f00cce11786742bd11e5e68c3bf85e6dc048c9"},{"fixed":"4678adf94da4a9e9683817b246b58ce15fb81782"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.11.1","v6.11.2","v6.11.3","v6.11.4","v6.11.5","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.5","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-58099.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.6.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.59"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.11.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-58099.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4678adf94da4a9e9683817b246b58ce15fb81782"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/59ba6cdadb9c26b606a365eb9c9b25eb2052622d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f82eb34fb59a8fb96c19f4f492c20eb774140bb5"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
