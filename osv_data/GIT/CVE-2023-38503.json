Starting in version 10.3.0 and prior to version 10.5.0, the permission filters (i.e. `user_created IS $CURRENT_USER`) are not properly checked when using GraphQL subscription resulting in unauthorized users getting event on their subscription which they should not be receiving according to the permissions. This can be any collection but out-of-the box the `directus_users` collection is configured with such a permissions filter allowing you to get updates for other users when changes happen. Version 10.5.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, disable GraphQL subscriptions.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/directus/directus","events":[{"introduced":"c0cd7860b1e0d6491688462479ff3fe2106e98c7"},{"fixed":"373cc9f4fa3a8ad8bff50d433a53e00945db56ea"}]}],"versions":["v10.3.0","v10.4.0","v10.4.2","v10.4.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-38503.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/19155"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-gggm-66rh-pp98"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
