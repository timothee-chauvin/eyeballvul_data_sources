In affected versions an attacker can cause a denial of service by uploading specially crafted files which will cause the server to allocate too much memory / CPU. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 21.0.8 , 22.2.4 or 23.0.1. Users unable to upgrade should disable preview generation with the `'enable_previews'` config flag.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2721bbb5da8a9abb9a8ee610181315ad9b6b8ba8"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server","events":[{"introduced":"c67e1420c8f741bfa43db08fcc295ec3b156fff8"},{"fixed":"fb5dbd80594c2c84fbd7fd33f04cea752e619aad"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server","events":[{"introduced":"0619207f13792250aea775a2c3133d41ab625980"},{"fixed":"e69281c66faec110af41ee63acb1c1168209d92f"}]}],"versions":["22.1.0","list","v1.0.0beta1","v1.0RC1","v1.1","v11.0.0","v11.0RC2","v12.0.0beta1","v12.0.0beta2","v12.0.0beta3","v12.0.0beta4","v13.0.0RC1","v13.0.0beta1","v13.0.0beta2","v13.0.0beta3","v13.0.0beta4","v14.0.0RC1","v14.0.0RC2","v14.0.0beta1","v14.0.0beta2","v14.0.0beta3","v14.0.0beta4","v15.0.0RC1","v15.0.0beta1","v15.0.0beta2","v16.0.0RC1","v16.0.0alpha1","v16.0.0beta1","v16.0.0beta2","v16.0.0beta3","v17.0.0beta1","v17.0.0beta2","v17.0.0beta3","v17.0.0beta4","v18.0.0RC1","v18.0.0beta1","v18.0.0beta2","v18.0.0beta3","v18.0.0beta4","v19.0.0RC1","v19.0.0RC2","v19.0.0beta1","v19.0.0beta2","v19.0.0beta3","v19.0.0beta4","v19.0.0beta5","v19.0.0beta6","v19.0.0beta7","v2.0beta3","v20.0.0RC1","v20.0.0beta1","v20.0.0beta2","v20.0.0beta3","v20.0.0beta4","v21.0.0","v21.0.0RC1","v21.0.0RC2","v21.0.0beta1","v21.0.0beta2","v21.0.0beta3","v21.0.0beta4","v21.0.0beta5","v21.0.0beta6","v21.0.0beta7","v21.0.0beta8","v21.0.1","v21.0.1RC1","v21.0.2","v21.0.2RC1","v21.0.3","v21.0.3rc1","v21.0.4","v21.0.4rc1","v21.0.5","v21.0.5rc1","v21.0.6","v21.0.6rc1","v21.0.7","v21.0.8rc1","v21.0.8rc2","v21.0.8rc3","v22.0.0","v22.1.0","v22.1.0rc1","v22.1.1","v22.1.1rc1","v22.1.1rc2","v22.2.0","v22.2.0rc2","v22.2.1","v22.2.1rc1","v22.2.2","v22.2.3","v22.2.4rc1","v22.2.4rc2","v22.2.4rc3","v23.0.0","v23.0.1rc1","v23.0.1rc2","v23.0.1rc3","v3.0","v3.0RC1","v3.0alpha1","v4.0.0","v4.0.0RC","v4.0.0RC2","v4.0.0beta","v4.0.1","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.5","v4.0.6","v4.5.0","v4.5.0RC1","v4.5.0RC2","v4.5.0RC3","v4.5.0beta1","v4.5.0beta2","v4.5.0beta3","v4.5.0beta4","v5.0.0","v5.0.0RC1","v5.0.0RC2","v5.0.0RC3","v5.0.0alpha1","v5.0.0beta1","v5.0.0beta2","v6.0.0RC1","v6.0.0RC2","v6.0.0alpha2","v6.0.0beta2","v6.0.0beta3","v6.0.0beta4","v6.0.0beta5","v7.0.0alpha2","v7.0.0beta1","v8.0.0","v8.0.0RC1","v8.0.0RC2","v8.0.0alpha1","v8.0.0alpha2","v8.0.0beta1","v8.0.0beta2","v8.1.0alpha1","v8.1.0alpha2","v8.1.0beta1","v8.1.0beta2","v8.1RC2","v8.2RC1","v8.2beta1","v9.0.0beta2","v9.0.1beta2","v9.0beta1","v9.1.0beta1","v9.1.0beta2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24741.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-jf3h-xf4q-mh89"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-17"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/30291"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1261225"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
