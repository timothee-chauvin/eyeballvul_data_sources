  "summary": "OAUTH2 bearer bypass in connection re-use",
  "details": "libcurl might reuse OAUTH2-authenticated connections without properly making\nsure that the connection was authenticated with the same credentials as set\nfor this transfer. This affects SASL-enabled protocols: SMTP(S), IMAP(S),\nPOP3(S) and LDAP(S) (OpenLDAP only).\n\nlibcurl maintains a pool of live connections after a transfer has completed\n(sometimes called the connection cache). This pool of connections is then gone\nthrough when a new transfer is requested and if there is a live connection\navailable that can be reused, it is preferred instead of creating a new one.\n\nDue to this security vulnerability, a connection that is successfully created\nand authenticated with a username + OAUTH2 bearer could subsequently be\nerroneously reused even for user + [other OAUTH2 bearer], even though that\nmight not even be a valid bearer. This could lead to an authentication bypass,\neither by mistake or by a malicious actor.",
