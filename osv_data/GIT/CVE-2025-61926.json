In versions prior to 4.5, a vulnerability in Allstarâ€™s Reviewbot component caused inbound webhook requests to be validated against a hard-coded, shared secret. The value used for the secret token was compiled into the Allstar binary and could not be configured at runtime. In practice, this meant that every deployment using Reviewbot would validate requests with the same secret unless the operator modified source code and rebuilt the component - an expectation that is not documented and is easy to miss. All Allstar releases prior to v4.5 that include the Reviewbot code path are affected. Deployments on v4.5 and later are not affected. Those who have not enabled or exposed the Reviewbot endpoint are not exposed to this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ossf/allstar","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e004ecb540d63ca6f5b1689b41af6c0040a82c73"}]}],"versions":["v2.0","v3.0","v4.0","v4.1","v4.2","v4.3","v4.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-61926.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ossf/allstar/security/advisories/GHSA-33f4-mjch-7fpr"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ossf/allstar/commit/e004ecb540d63ca6f5b1689b41af6c0040a82c73"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ossf/allstar/pull/713"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ossf/allstar/blob/294ae985cc2facd0918e8d820e4196021aa0b914/pkg/reviewbot/reviewbot.go#L59"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-453","CWE-798"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
