  "details": "jumpserver is an open source bastion machine, professional operation and maintenance security audit system that complies with 4A specifications. A flaw in the Core API allows attackers to bypass password brute-force protections by spoofing arbitrary IP addresses. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can effectively make unlimited password attempts by altering their apparent IP address for each request. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.8.0.",
