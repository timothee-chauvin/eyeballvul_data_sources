  "details": "When curl is instructed to download content using the Metalink feature, the\ncontents is verified against a hash provided in the Metalink XML file.\n\nThe Metalink XML file points out to the client how to get the same content\nfrom a set of different URLs, potentially hosted by different servers and the\nclient can then download the file from one or several of them. In a serial or\nparallel manner.\n\nIf one of the servers hosting the contents has been breached and the contents\nof the specific file on that server is replaced with a modified payload, curl\nshould detect this when the hash of the file mismatches after a completed\ndownload. It should remove the contents and instead try getting the contents\nfrom another URL. This is not done, and instead such a hash mismatch is only\nmentioned in text and the potentially malicious content is kept in the file on\ndisk.\n\nThere is a risk the user does not notice the message and instead assumes the\nfile is fine.",
