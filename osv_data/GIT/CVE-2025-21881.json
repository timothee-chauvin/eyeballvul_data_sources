Then, the operation on the same pfn is performed\nin uprobe_write_opcode()->__replace_page() to unconditional decrease the\nRSS count and old_folio's refcount.\n\nTherefore, two bugs are introduced:\n\n 1. The RSS count is incorrect, when process exit, the check_mm() report\n    error \"Bad rss-count\".\n\n 2. The reserved folio (zero folio) is freed when folio->refcount is zero,\n    then free_pages_prepare->free_page_is_bad() report error\n    \"Bad page state\".\n\nThere is more, the following warning could also theoretically be triggered:\n\n  __replace_page()\n    -> ...\n      -> folio_remove_rmap_pte()\n        -> VM_WARN_ON_FOLIO(is_zero_folio(folio), folio)\n\nConsidering that uprobe hit on the zero folio is a very rare case, just\nreject zero old folio immediately after get_user_page_vma_remote().\n\n[ mingo: Cleaned up the changelog
