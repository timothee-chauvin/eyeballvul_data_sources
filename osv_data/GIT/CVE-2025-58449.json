In Maho prior to 25.9.0, an authenticated staff user with access to the `Dashboard` and `Catalog\\Manage Products` permissions can create a custom option on a listing with a file input field. By allowing file uploads with a `.php` extension, the user can use the filed to upload malicious PHP files, gaining remote code execution. Version 25.9.0 fixes the issue.",
