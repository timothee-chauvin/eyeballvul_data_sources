The function is able to accept a hostname and return an IP address for that hostname. To get the IP address the function performs a DNS lookup. The DNS lookup happens when used with `helm install|upgrade|template` or when the Helm SDK is used to render a chart. Information passed into the chart can be disclosed to the DNS servers used to lookup the IP address. For example, a malicious chart could inject `getHostByName` into a chart in order to disclose values to a malicious DNS server. The issue has been fixed in Helm 3.11.1. Prior to using a chart with Helm verify the `getHostByName` function is not being used in a template to disclose any information you do not want passed to DNS servers.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/helm/helm","events":[{"introduced":"e29ce2a54e96cd02ccfce88bee4f58bb6e2a28b6"},{"fixed":"293b50c65d4d56187cd4e2f390f0ada46b4c4737"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-25165.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/25xxx/CVE-2023-25165.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/5abcf74227bfe8e5a3dbf105fe62e7b12deb58d2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-pwcw-6f5g-gxf8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25165"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/25xxx/CVE-2023-25165.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
