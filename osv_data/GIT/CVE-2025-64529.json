{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-64529","published":"2025-11-10T22:28:51.589Z","modified":"2025-11-20T10:09:32.342905Z","aliases":["GHSA-pm3x-jrhh-qcr7","GO-2025-4120"],"summary":"SpiceDB's WriteRelationships fails silently if payload is too big","details":"SpiceDB is an open source database system for creating and managing security-critical application permissions. In versions prior to 1.45.2, users who use the exclusion operator somewhere in their authorization schema; have configured their SpiceDB server such that `--write-relationships-max-updates-per-call` is bigger than 6500; and issue calls to WriteRelationships with a large enough number of updates that cause the payload to be bigger than what their datastore allows; will receive a successful response from their `WriteRelationships` call, when in reality that call failed, and receive incorrect permission check results, if those relationships had to be read to resolve the relation involving the exclusion. Version 1.45.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, set `--write-relationships-max-updates-per-call` to `1000`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"449c43d3c8dbb72defa98dfd097392c2fa137870"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.45.2"}]}}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.16.1","v1.16.2","v1.17.0","v1.18.1","v1.19.0","v1.2.0","v1.21.0","v1.21.0-rc1","v1.22.0","v1.22.0-rc1","v1.22.0-rc2","v1.22.0-rc4","v1.22.0-rc5","v1.22.0-rc6","v1.22.0-rc7","v1.22.0-rc8","v1.22.1","v1.22.1-rc1","v1.22.2","v1.23.0","v1.23.0-rc1","v1.23.0-rc2","v1.23.0-rc3","v1.23.0-rc4","v1.23.1","v1.23.1-rc1","v1.24.0","v1.24.0-rc1","v1.24.0-rc2","v1.24.0-rc3","v1.25.0","v1.25.0-rc1","v1.25.0-rc2","v1.25.0-rc3","v1.25.0-rc4","v1.26.0","v1.26.0-rc1","v1.26.0-rc2","v1.27.0","v1.27.0-rc1","v1.27.1-rc1","v1.28.0","v1.28.0-rc1","v1.29.0","v1.29.1","v1.29.1-rc1","v1.3.0","v1.30.0","v1.31.0","v1.32.0","v1.33.0","v1.34.0","v1.35.0","v1.35.1","v1.35.2","v1.35.3","v1.37.0","v1.38.0","v1.39.0","v1.4.0","v1.40.0","v1.40.1","v1.41.0","v1.42.0","v1.42.1","v1.43.0","v1.44.0","v1.44.3","v1.44.4","v1.45.0","v1.45.1","v1.5.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64529.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-pm3x-jrhh-qcr7"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
