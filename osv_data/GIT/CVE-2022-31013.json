Versions 2.3.2 until 2.6.0 suffer from a bug in validating the access token, resulting in authentication bypass. The function `this.authProvider.verifyAccessKey` is an async function, as the code is not using `await` to wait for the verification result. Every time the function responds back with success, along with an unhandled exception if the token is invalid. A patch is available in version 2.6.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ramank775/chat-server","events":[{"introduced":"efe592001fc8032f45fbf8a08c2d444b3a7890af"},{"fixed":"b4cd6a5d0fe68f7b9cf655d487ec11d3830143d5"}]}],"versions":["v2.3.2","v2.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31013.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ramank775/chat-server/discussions/78"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ramank775/chat-server/releases/tag/v2.6.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ramank775/chat-server/security/advisories/GHSA-xx4j-qqpp-v277"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
