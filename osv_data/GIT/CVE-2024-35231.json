Versions of rack-contrib prior to 2.5.0 are vulnerable to denial of service due to the fact that the user controlled data `profiler_runs` was not constrained to any limitation. This would lead to allocating resources on the server side with no limitation and a potential denial of service by remotely user-controlled data. Version 2.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d5265bc4f849f4bf55b230d3a0929e513acd5fac"}]}],"versions":["0.9.0","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.0.39.g17d21b4","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-35231.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-8c8q-2xw3-j869"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/commit/0eec2a9836329051c6742549e65a94a4c24fe6f7"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
