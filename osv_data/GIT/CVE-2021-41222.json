In affected versions the implementation of `SplitV` can trigger a segfault is an attacker supplies negative arguments. This occurs whenever `size_splits` contains more than one value and at least one value is negative. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"25d622ffc432acc736b14ca3904177579e733cc6"}]}],"versions":["0.12.0-rc0","0.12.0-rc1","0.12.1","0.5.0","0.6.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.0rc0","v0.11.0","v0.11.0rc0","v0.11.0rc1","v0.11.0rc2","v0.12.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0rc0","v0.9.0","v0.9.0rc0","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-alpha","v1.0.0-rc0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc0","v1.1.0-rc1","v1.1.0-rc2","v1.12.0","v1.12.0-rc0","v1.12.0-rc1","v1.12.0-rc2","v1.12.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc0","v1.2.0-rc1","v1.2.0-rc2","v1.3.0-rc0","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-rc0","v1.5.0-rc1","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc0","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.8.0","v1.8.0-rc0","v1.8.0-rc1","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-rc0","v1.9.0-rc1","v1.9.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-41222.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["155248897806631646894894032128092835452","63509871990897372594330344710811449368","235356483153968333294529749571913080419","248957730783742400689784506060539203810"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2021-41222-72bd4800","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/25d622ffc432acc736b14ca3904177579e733cc6","target":{"file":"tensorflow/core/ops/array_ops.cc"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["19946764870141937795827098636538825565","140726300659285684956096068186787392565","110222053743676634793320510996824713541"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2021-41222-e67b18d1","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/25d622ffc432acc736b14ca3904177579e733cc6","target":{"file":"tensorflow/core/kernels/split_v_op.cc"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/25d622ffc432acc736b14ca3904177579e733cc6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-cpf4-wx82-gxp6"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
