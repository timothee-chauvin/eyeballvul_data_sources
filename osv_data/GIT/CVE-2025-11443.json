  "details": "A weakness has been identified in JhumanJ OpnForm up to 1.9.3. This affects an unknown function of the file /api/password/email of the component Forgotten Password Handler. This manipulation causes information exposure through discrepancy. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The attack is considered to have high complexity. The exploitability is reported as difficult. The exploit has been made available to the public and could be exploited. This issue is currently aligned with Laravel issue #46465, which is why no mitigation action was taken.",
