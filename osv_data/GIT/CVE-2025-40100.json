However\nthis expectation is wrong since we can have a new block group created in\nthe current transaction which is still empty and for which we still have\nnot added the block group's item to the extent tree, in which case we do\nnot have any items in the extent tree associated to the block group.\n\nThe insertion of a new block group's block group item in the extent tree\nhappens at btrfs_create_pending_block_groups() when it calls the helper\ninsert_block_group_item(). This typically is done when a transaction\nhandle is released, committed or when running delayed refs (either as\npart of a transaction commit or when serving tickets for space reservation\nif we are low on free space).\n\nSo remove the assertion at populate_free_space_tree() even when the block\ngroup tree feature is not enabled and update the comment to mention this\ncase.\n\nSyzbot reported this with the following stack trace:\n\n  BTRFS info (device loop3 state M): rebuilding free space tree\n  assertion failed: ret == 0 :: 0, in fs/btrfs/free-space-tree.c:1115\n  ------------[ cut here
