{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-27391","published":"2024-05-01T13:05:16.396Z","modified":"2025-12-05T04:28:36.064416Z","summary":"wifi: wilc1000: do not realloc workqueue everytime an interface is added","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: wilc1000: do not realloc workqueue everytime an interface is added\n\nCommit 09ed8bfc5215 (\"wilc1000: Rename workqueue from \"WILC_wq\" to\n\"NETDEV-wq\"\") moved workqueue creation in wilc_netdev_ifc_init in order to\nset the interface name in the workqueue name. However, while the driver\nneeds only one workqueue, the wilc_netdev_ifc_init is called each time we\nadd an interface over a phy, which in turns overwrite the workqueue with a\nnew one. This can be observed with the following commands:\n\nfor i in $(seq 0 10)\ndo\n  iw phy phy0 interface add wlan1 type managed\n  iw dev wlan1 del\ndone\nps -eo pid,comm|grep wlan\n\n 39 kworker/R-wlan0\n 98 kworker/R-wlan1\n102 kworker/R-wlan1\n105 kworker/R-wlan1\n108 kworker/R-wlan1\n111 kworker/R-wlan1\n114 kworker/R-wlan1\n117 kworker/R-wlan1\n120 kworker/R-wlan1\n123 kworker/R-wlan1\n126 kworker/R-wlan1\n129 kworker/R-wlan1\n\nFix this leakage by putting back hif_workqueue allocation in\nwilc_cfg80211_init. Regarding the workqueue name, it is indeed relevant to\nset it lowercase, however it is not  attached to a specific netdev, so\nenforcing netdev name in the name is not so relevant. Still, enrich the\nname with the wiphy name to make it clear which phy is using the workqueue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"09ed8bfc5215ad5aac91c50008277b5586b9ef24"},{"fixed":"515cc676dfbce40d93c92b1ff3c1070e917f4e52"},{"fixed":"4041c60a9d543b3ad50225385b072ba68e96166e"},{"fixed":"90ae293d1d255f622318fce6eeea2e18f9fde5c1"},{"fixed":"9ab0c303ccabfd6bdce14432792d41090070008c"},{"fixed":"328efda22af81130c2ad981c110518cb29ff2f1d"}]}],"versions":["v5.16","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.3","v6.6.4","v6.6.5","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.7.1","v6.7.10","v6.7.2","v6.7.3","v6.7.4","v6.7.5","v6.7.6","v6.7.7","v6.7.8","v6.7.9","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-27391.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.83"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.23"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.7.11"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.8.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-27391.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/328efda22af81130c2ad981c110518cb29ff2f1d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4041c60a9d543b3ad50225385b072ba68e96166e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/515cc676dfbce40d93c92b1ff3c1070e917f4e52"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/90ae293d1d255f622318fce6eeea2e18f9fde5c1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9ab0c303ccabfd6bdce14432792d41090070008c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/27xxx/CVE-2024-27391.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27391"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/27xxx/CVE-2024-27391.json"}}
