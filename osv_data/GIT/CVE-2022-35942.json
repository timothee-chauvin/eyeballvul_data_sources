{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-35942","published":"2022-08-12T22:25:09Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:31:54.520740Z","aliases":["GHSA-j259-6c58-9m58"],"summary":"loopback-connector-postgresql Vulnerable to Improper Sanitization of `contains` Filter","details":"Improper input validation on the `contains` LoopBack filter may allow for arbitrary SQL injection. When the extended filter property `contains` is permitted to be interpreted by the Postgres connector, it is possible to inject arbitrary SQL which may affect the confidentiality and integrity of data stored on the connected database. A patch was released in version 5.5.1. This affects users who does any of the following: - Connect to the database via the DataSource with `allowExtendedProperties: true` setting OR - Uses the connector's CRUD methods directly OR - Uses the connector's other methods to interpret the LoopBack filter. Users who are unable to upgrade should do the following if applicable: - Remove `allowExtendedProperties: true` DataSource setting - Add `allowExtendedProperties: false` DataSource setting - When passing directly to the connector functions, manually sanitize the user input for the `contains` LoopBack filter beforehand.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback-connector-postgresql","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c684889a3a86f230e1642657b74ec17b572b01b4"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.6.3","v2.7.0","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.4.0","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.7.0","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.8.2","v3.8.3","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v4.0.0","v5.0.0","v5.0.1","v5.0.2","v5.1.0","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.3.0","v5.4.0","v5.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35942.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback-connector-postgresql/security/advisories/GHSA-j259-6c58-9m58"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback-connector-postgresql/commit/d57406c6737692a3a106b58a35406290cddb23e5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-89"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
