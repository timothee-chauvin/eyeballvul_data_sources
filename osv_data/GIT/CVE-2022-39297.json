Attackers can deserialize arbitrary data on affected versions of `melisplatform/melis-cms`, and ultimately leads to the execution of arbitrary PHP code on the system. Conducting this attack does not require authentication. Users should immediately upgrade to `melisplatform/melis-cms` >= 5.0.1. This issue was addressed by restricting allowed classes when deserializing user-controlled data.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/melisplatform/melis-cms","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d124b2474699a679a24ec52620cadceb3d4cec11"}]}],"versions":["3.0.7","v2.1","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.10","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.0.8","v3.0.9","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.10","v3.1.11","v3.1.12","v3.1.13","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.1.4","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.1.9","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.10","v3.2.11","v3.2.12","v3.2.13","v3.2.14","v3.2.2","v3.2.3","v3.2.4","v3.2.5","v3.2.6","v3.2.7","v3.2.8","v3.2.9","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.10","v4.0.11","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.5","v4.0.6","v4.0.7","v4.0.8","v4.0.9","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v5.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39297.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/39xxx/CVE-2022-39297.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/melisplatform/melis-cms/commit/d124b2474699a679a24ec52620cadceb3d4cec11"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/melisplatform/melis-cms/security/advisories/GHSA-m3m3-6gww-7gj9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39297"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/39xxx/CVE-2022-39297.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
