A user can also use Nebula to execute arbitrary code in the user's own context, e.g., for user-level persistence or to bypass security controls. NOTE: the vendor states that this \"requires a high degree of access and other preconditions that are tough to achieve.\"","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/slackhq/nebula","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"13941aa7232765efc671c6d0d6e1a8c0d4704603"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-11498.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://www.pwn3d.org/posts/7918501-slack-nebula-relative-path-bug-bounty-disclosure"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/pull/191"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
