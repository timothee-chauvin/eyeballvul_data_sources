  "details": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in the @opennextjs/cloudflare package. The vulnerability stems from an unimplemented feature in the Cloudflare adapter for Open Next, which allowed unauthenticated users to proxy arbitrary remote content via the /_next/image endpoint.\n\nThis issue allowed attackers to load remote resources from arbitrary hosts under the victim site\u2019s domain for any site deployed using the Cloudflare adapter for Open Next.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n https://victim-site.com/_next/image?url=https://attacker.com \n\nIn this example, attacker-controlled content from attacker.com is served through the victim site\u2019s domain (victim-site.com), violating the same-origin policy and potentially misleading users or other services.\n\n\n\n\nImpact:\n\n  *  SSRF via unrestricted remote URL loading\n\n\n\n\n  *  Arbitrary remote content loading\n\n\n\n\n  *  Potential internal service exposure or phishing risks through domain abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitigation:\n\nThe following mitigations have been put in place:\n\n  *  Server side updates to Cloudflare\u2019s platform to restrict the content loaded via the\u00a0/_next/image\u00a0endpoint to images. The update automatically mitigates the issue for all existing and any future sites deployed to Cloudflare using the affected version of the Cloudflare adapter for Open Next\n\n\n\n\n  *   Root cause fix https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/pull/727 \u00a0to the Cloudflare adapter for Open Next. The patched version of the adapter is found here\u00a0 @opennextjs/cloudflare@1.3.0 https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opennextjs/cloudflare/v/1.3.0 \n\n\n  *   Package dependency update https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/9608 \u00a0to create-cloudflare (c3) to use the fixed version of the Cloudflare adapter for Open Next. The patched version of create-cloudflare is found here:\u00a0 create-cloudflare@2.49.3 https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare/v/2.49.3 \n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the automatic mitigation deployed on Cloudflare\u2019s platform, we encourage affected  users to upgrade to @opennext/cloudflare v1.3.0 and use the  remotePatterns  https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#remotepatterns  filter in Next config https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#remotepatterns  if they need to allow-list external urls with images assets.",
