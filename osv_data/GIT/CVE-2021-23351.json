The reader in this package is a default bufio.Reader wrapping a net.Conn. It will read from the connection until it finds a newline. Since no limits are implemented in the code, a deliberately malformed V1 header could be used to exhaust memory in a server process using this code - and create a DoS. This can be exploited by sending a stream starting with PROXY and continuing to send data (which does not contain a newline) until the target stops acknowledging. The risk here is small, because only trusted sources should be allowed to send proxy protocol headers.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7f48261db810703d173f27f3309a808cc2b49b8b"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-23351.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/commit/7f48261db810703d173f27f3309a808cc2b49b8b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/issues/69"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/pull/71"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMPIRESGOPROXYPROTO-1081577"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4BNVGJMVI3ZTZ675EFPUHPGXCKCGSX46/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C36IBVOZXRTWM7MGTRUTOM56P5RR74VU/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
