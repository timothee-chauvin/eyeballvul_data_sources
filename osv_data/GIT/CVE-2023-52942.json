As a result, it is possible to leave parent with no\neffective cpu left even if there are tasks in the parent cpuset. This\ncan lead to system panic as reported in [1].\n\nFix this probem by updating the check to fail the enabling the partition\nif parent's effective_cpus is a subset of the child's cpus_allowed.\n\nAlso record the error code when an error happens in update_prstate()\nand add a test case where parent partition and child have the same cpu\nlist and parent has task. Enabling partition in the child will fail in\nthis case.\n\n[1] https://www.spinics.net/lists/cgroups/msg36254.html","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"f0af1bfc27b52a4d42510051154c61bd176a8f06"},{"fixed":"a2ab7f2cf5ef8f0c6212a246e681d1fe358cec1f"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"f0af1bfc27b52a4d42510051154c61bd176a8f06"},{"fixed":"e5ae8803847b80fe9d744a3174abe2b7bfed222a"}]}],"versions":["v6.0","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-52942.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.1.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.11"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-52942.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a2ab7f2cf5ef8f0c6212a246e681d1fe358cec1f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e5ae8803847b80fe9d744a3174abe2b7bfed222a"}]}
