The segmentation relies on frag_list being\nuntouched when passing through the network stack. This assumption can be\nbroken sometimes, where frag_list itself gets pulled into linear area,\nleaving frag_list being NULL. When this happens it can trigger\nfollowing NULL pointer dereference, and panic the kernel. Reverse the\ntest condition should fix it.\n\n[19185.577801][    C1] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address:\n...\n[19185.663775][    C1] RIP:
