MADV_FREE may split THPs if it is called\nfor partial THP.  It may trigger the below race:\n\n           CPU A                         CPU B\n           -----                         -----\n  smaps walk:                      MADV_FREE:\n  page_mapcount()\n    PageCompound()\n                                   split_huge_page()\n    page = compound_head(page)\n    PageDoubleMap(page)\n\nWhen calling PageDoubleMap() this page is not a tail page of THP anymore\nso the BUG is triggered.\n\nThis could be fixed by elevated refcount of the page before calling\nmapcount, but that would prevent it from counting migration entries, and\nit seems overkilling because the race just could happen when PMD is\nsplit so all PTE entries of tail pages are actually migration entries,\nand smaps_account() does treat migration entries as mapcount == 1 as\nKirill pointed out.\n\nAdd a new parameter for smaps_account() to tell this entry is migration\nentry then skip calling page_mapcount().  Don't skip getting mapcount\nfor device private entries since they do track references with mapcount.\n\nPagemap also has the similar issue although it was not reported.  Fixed\nit as well.\n\n[shy828301@gmail.com: v4]\n[nathan@kernel.org: avoid unused variable warning in
