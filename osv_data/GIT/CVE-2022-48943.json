This function test token value of struct\nkvm_vcpu_pv_apf_data, which must be reset to zero by Guest kernel when a\nREADY event is finished by Guest. If value is zero meaning that a READY\nevent is done, so the KVM can deliver another.\nBut the kvm_arch_setup_async_pf() may produce a valid token with zero\nvalue, which is confused with previous mention and may lead the loss of\nthis READY event.\n\nThis bug may cause task blocked forever in Guest:\n INFO: task stress:7532 blocked for more than 1254 seconds.\n       Not tainted 5.10.0 #16\n \"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs\" disables this message.\n task:stress          state:D stack:    0 pid: 7532 ppid:  1409\n flags:0x00000080\n Call Trace:\n  __schedule+0x1e7/0x650\n  schedule+0x46/0xb0\n  kvm_async_pf_task_wait_schedule+0xad/0xe0\n  ?
