But if we have already\ndropped the queue ref, then the lock might already be freed as part of\nthe queue, leading to uaf.\n\nTo prevent this, move the fence lock into the fence itself so we don't\nrun into lifetime issues. Alternative might be to have device level\nlock, or only release the queue in the fence release callback, however\nthat might require pushing to another worker to avoid locking issues.\n\nReferences: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/xe/kernel/-/issues/2454\nReferences: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/xe/kernel/-/issues/2342\nReferences: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/xe/kernel/-/issues/2020\n(cherry picked from commit 7116c35aacedc38be6d15bd21b2fc936eed0008b)","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"dd08ebf6c3525a7ea2186e636df064ea47281987"},{"fixed":"10081b0b0ed201f53e24bd92deb2e0f3c3e713d4"},{"fixed":"730b72480e29f63fd644f5fa57c9d46109428953"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.10.1","v6.10.2","v6.10.3","v6.10.4","v6.10.5","v6.10.6","v6.10.7","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.7","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-46683.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.10.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-46683.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10081b0b0ed201f53e24bd92deb2e0f3c3e713d4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/730b72480e29f63fd644f5fa57c9d46109428953"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/46xxx/CVE-2024-46683.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46683"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/46xxx/CVE-2024-46683.json"}}
