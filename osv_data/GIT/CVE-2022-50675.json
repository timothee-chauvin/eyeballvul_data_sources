Therefore mte_sync_tags() could safely use\ntest_and_set_bit(PG_mte_tagged, &page->flags) without inadvertently\nsetting PG_mte_tagged on an untagged page.\n\nThe above commit was required as guests may enable MTE without any\ncontrol at the stage 2 mapping, nor a PROT_MTE mapping in the VMM.\nHowever, the side-effect was that any page with a PTE that looked like\nswap (or migration) was getting PG_mte_tagged set automatically. A\nsubsequent page copy (e.g. migration) copied the tags to the destination\npage even if the tags were owned by KASAN.\n\nThis issue was masked by the page_kasan_tag_reset() call introduced in\ncommit e5b8d9218951 (\"arm64: mte: reset the page tag in page->flags\").\nWhen this commit was reverted (20794545c146), KASAN started reporting\naccess faults because the overriding tags in a page did not match the\noriginal page->flags (with CONFIG_KASAN_HW_TAGS=y):\n\n  BUG: KASAN: invalid-access in copy_page+0x10/0xd0 arch/arm64/lib/copy_page.S:26\n  Read at addr f5ff000017f2e000 by task syz-executor.1/2218\n  Pointer tag: [f5], memory tag: [f2]\n\nMove the PG_mte_tagged bit setting from mte_sync_tags() to the actual\nplace where tags are cleared (mte_sync_page_tags()) or restored\n(mte_restore_tags()).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"69e3b846d8a753f9f279f29531ca56b0f7563ad0"},{"fixed":"918002bdbe4328c8c0164a22e8ebf2384b80dc23"},{"fixed":"749e9fc18b1e1a3f93a9512e91bd7f93002d2821"},{"fixed":"a8e5e5146ad08d794c58252bab00b261045ef16d"}]}],"versions":["v5.13","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50675.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.14.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.82"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50675.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/749e9fc18b1e1a3f93a9512e91bd7f93002d2821"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/918002bdbe4328c8c0164a22e8ebf2384b80dc23"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a8e5e5146ad08d794c58252bab00b261045ef16d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50675.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50675"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50675.json"}}
