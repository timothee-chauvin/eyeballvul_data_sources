It's possible to trigger memleak when the rule\nforwards packets from internal port and over tunnel, in the case that,\nfor example, CT 'new' state offload is allowed. As int_port object is\nassigned to the flow attribute of post_act rule, and its refcnt is\nincremented by mlx5e_tc_int_port_get(), but mlx5e_tc_int_port_put() is\nnot called, the refcnt is never decremented, then int_port is never\nfreed.\n\nThe kmemleak reports the following error:\nunreferenced object 0xffff888128204b80 (size 64):\n  comm \"handler20\", pid 50121, jiffies 4296973009 (age 642.932s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    01 00 00 00 19 00 00 00 03 f0 00 00 04 00 00 00  ................\n    98 77 67 41 81 88 ff ff 98 77 67 41 81 88 ff ff  .wgA.....wgA....\n  backtrace:\n    [<00000000e992680d>] kmalloc_trace+0x27/0x120\n    [<000000009e945a98>] mlx5e_tc_int_port_get+0x3f3/0xe20 [mlx5_core]\n    [<0000000035a537f0>] mlx5e_tc_add_fdb_flow+0x473/0xcf0 [mlx5_core]\n    [<0000000070c2cec6>] __mlx5e_add_fdb_flow+0x7cf/0xe90 [mlx5_core]\n    [<000000005cc84048>] mlx5e_configure_flower+0xd40/0x4c40 [mlx5_core]\n    [<000000004f8a2031>] mlx5e_rep_indr_offload.isra.0+0x10e/0x1c0 [mlx5_core]\n    [<000000007df797dc>] mlx5e_rep_indr_setup_tc_cb+0x90/0x130 [mlx5_core]\n    [<0000000016c15cc3>] tc_setup_cb_add+0x1cf/0x410\n    [<00000000a63305b4>] fl_hw_replace_filter+0x38f/0x670 [cls_flower]\n    [<000000008bc9e77c>] fl_change+0x1fd5/0x4430 [cls_flower]\n    [<00000000e7f766e4>] tc_new_tfilter+0x867/0x2010\n    [<00000000e101c0ef>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x6fc/0x9f0\n    [<00000000e1111d44>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x12c/0x360\n    [<0000000082dd6c8b>] netlink_unicast+0x438/0x710\n    [<00000000fc568f70>] netlink_sendmsg+0x794/0xc50\n    [<0000000016e92590>] sock_sendmsg+0xc5/0x190\n\nSo fix this by moving int_port cleanup code to the flow attribute\nfree helper, which is used by all the attribute free cases.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"8300f225268be9ee2c0daf5a3f23929fcdcbf213"},{"fixed":"bc1918bac0f30e3f551ef5649b53062917db55fa"},{"fixed":"ac5da544a3c2047cbfd715acd9cec8380d7fe5c6"}]}],"versions":["v5.17","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.4.1","v6.4.10","v6.4.2","v6.4.3","v6.4.4","v6.4.5","v6.4.6","v6.4.7","v6.4.8","v6.4.9","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53999.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.11"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53999.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ac5da544a3c2047cbfd715acd9cec8380d7fe5c6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bc1918bac0f30e3f551ef5649b53062917db55fa"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53999.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53999"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53999.json"}}
