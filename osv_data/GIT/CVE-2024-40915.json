{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-40915","published":"2024-07-12T12:24:58Z","modified":"2025-11-04T06:25:48.735788Z","summary":"riscv: rewrite __kernel_map_pages() to fix sleeping in invalid context","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: rewrite __kernel_map_pages() to fix sleeping in invalid context\n\n__kernel_map_pages() is a debug function which clears the valid bit in page\ntable entry for deallocated pages to detect illegal memory accesses to\nfreed pages.\n\nThis function set/clear the valid bit using __set_memory(). __set_memory()\nacquires init_mm's semaphore, and this operation may sleep. This is\nproblematic, because  __kernel_map_pages() can be called in atomic context,\nand thus is illegal to sleep. An example warning that this causes:\n\nBUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/rwsem.c:1578\nin_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 2, name: kthreadd\npreempt_count: 2, expected: 0\nCPU: 0 PID: 2 Comm: kthreadd Not tainted 6.9.0-g1d4c6d784ef6 #37\nHardware name: riscv-virtio,qemu (DT)\nCall Trace:\n[<ffffffff800060dc>] dump_backtrace+0x1c/0x24\n[<ffffffff8091ef6e>] show_stack+0x2c/0x38\n[<ffffffff8092baf8>] dump_stack_lvl+0x5a/0x72\n[<ffffffff8092bb24>] dump_stack+0x14/0x1c\n[<ffffffff8003b7ac>] __might_resched+0x104/0x10e\n[<ffffffff8003b7f4>] __might_sleep+0x3e/0x62\n[<ffffffff8093276a>] down_write+0x20/0x72\n[<ffffffff8000cf00>] __set_memory+0x82/0x2fa\n[<ffffffff8000d324>] __kernel_map_pages+0x5a/0xd4\n[<ffffffff80196cca>] __alloc_pages_bulk+0x3b2/0x43a\n[<ffffffff8018ee82>] __vmalloc_node_range+0x196/0x6ba\n[<ffffffff80011904>] copy_process+0x72c/0x17ec\n[<ffffffff80012ab4>] kernel_clone+0x60/0x2fe\n[<ffffffff80012f62>] kernel_thread+0x82/0xa0\n[<ffffffff8003552c>] kthreadd+0x14a/0x1be\n[<ffffffff809357de>] ret_from_fork+0xe/0x1c\n\nRewrite this function with apply_to_existing_page_range().
