Before versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18, when importing an OCI image, there was no limit on the number of bytes read for certain files. A maliciously crafted image with a large file where a limit was not applied could cause a denial of service. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.18 and 1.5.18.  Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/containerd/containerd","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"39bb06f98f17c7a226b10269d325c861585b2389"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/containerd/containerd","events":[{"introduced":"39259a8f35919a0d02c9ecc2871ddd6ccf6a7c6e"},{"fixed":"2456e983eb9e37e47538f59ea18f2043c9a73640"}]}],"versions":["0.0.2","0.0.3","0.0.4","0.0.5","v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.3","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-alpha0","v1.0.0-alpha1","v1.0.0-alpha2","v1.0.0-alpha3","v1.0.0-alpha4","v1.0.0-alpha5","v1.0.0-alpha6","v1.0.0-beta.0","v1.0.0-beta.1","v1.0.0-beta.2","v1.0.0-beta.3","v1.0.0-rc.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc.0","v1.1.0-rc.1","v1.1.0-rc.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-beta.0","v1.2.0-beta.1","v1.2.0-beta.2","v1.2.0-rc.0","v1.2.0-rc.1","v1.2.0-rc.2","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-beta.0","v1.3.0-beta.1","v1.3.0-beta.2","v1.3.0-rc.0","v1.3.0-rc.1","v1.3.0-rc.2","v1.3.0-rc.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.0-beta.0","v1.4.0-beta.1","v1.4.0-beta.2","v1.4.0-rc.0","v1.4.0-rc.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-beta.0","v1.5.0-beta.1","v1.5.0-beta.2","v1.5.0-beta.3","v1.5.0-beta.4","v1.5.0-rc.0","v1.5.0-rc.1","v1.5.0-rc.2","v1.5.0-rc.3","v1.5.1","v1.5.10","v1.5.11","v1.5.12","v1.5.13","v1.5.14","v1.5.15","v1.5.16","v1.5.17","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.5.6","v1.5.7","v1.5.8","v1.5.9","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.10","v1.6.11","v1.6.12","v1.6.13","v1.6.14","v1.6.15","v1.6.16","v1.6.17","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.6.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-25153.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-259w-8hf6-59c2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/0c314901076a74a7b797a545d2f462285fdbb8c4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.18"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.18"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
