A vulnerability in Discord Recon Server prior to 0.0.3 could be exploited to read internal files from the system and write files into the system resulting in remote code execution. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.3. As a workaround, one may copy the code from `assets/CommandInjection.py` in the Discord Recon Server code repository and overwrite vulnerable code from one's own Discord Recon Server implementation with code that contains the patch.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/demon1a/discord-recon","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"26e2a084679679cccdeeabbb6889ce120eff7e50"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-29461.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DEMON1A/Discord-Recon/security/advisories/GHSA-3m9v-v33c-g83x"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
