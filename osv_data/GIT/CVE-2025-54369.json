In versions 5.0.1 and below, Node-SAML loads the assertion from the (unsigned) original response document. This is different than the parts that are verified when checking signature. This allows an attacker to modify authentication details within a valid SAML assertion. For example, in one attack it is possible to remove any character from the SAML assertion username. This issue is fixed in version 5.1.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/node-saml/node-saml","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1d8d66f16536687d577eea3335533928b57397be"}]}],"versions":["0.0.3","v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.15.0","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.3.0","v0.30.0","v0.31.0","v0.32.0","v0.32.1","v0.33.0","v0.34.0","v0.35.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.5.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v3.0.0","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-beta.2","v4.0.0-beta.3","v4.0.0-beta.4","v4.0.0-beta.5","v4.0.0-beta.6","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v5.0.0","v5.0.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54369.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54369.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/node-saml/node-saml/commit/31ead9411ebc3e2385086fa9149b6c17732bca10"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/node-saml/node-saml/releases/tag/v5.1.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/node-saml/node-saml/security/advisories/GHSA-m837-g268-mmv7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54369"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-347","CWE-87"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54369.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
