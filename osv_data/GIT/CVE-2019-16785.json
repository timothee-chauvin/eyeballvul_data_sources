This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pylons/waitress","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8eba394ad75deaf9e5cd15b78a3d16b12e6b0eba"}]}],"versions":["0.1","0.2","0.3","0.4","0.5","0.6","0.6.1","0.7","0.8","0.8.1","0.8.10","0.8.11b0","0.8.2","0.8.3","0.8.4","0.8.5","0.8.6","0.8.7","0.8.8","0.8.9","0.9.0b0","v0.9.0","v0.9.0b1","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0a1","v1.0a2","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.0b1","v1.2.0b2","v1.2.0b3","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.0b0","v1.3.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-16785.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GVDHR2DNKCNQ7YQXISJ45NT4IQDX3LJ7/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LYEOTGWJZVKPRXX2HBNVIYWCX73QYPM5/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0720"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/#security-fixes"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/8eba394ad75deaf9e5cd15b78a3d16b12e6b0eba"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-pg36-wpm5-g57p"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00011.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
