An authenticated attacker can upload an HTML file containing JavaScript code and afterwards a file preview URL can be used to access the uploaded file. If a malicious user shares an uploaded HTML file containing JavaScript code with another user of the application, and tricks an authenticated victim into accessing a URL that results in the HTML code being interpreted by the web browser, then the included JavaScript code is executed under the context of the victim user session.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pydio/pydio-core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"87499355dd8666e2885b9f558af4843fce4f82c0"}]}],"versions":["6.2alpha","6.2beta","6.2rc","ajaxplorer-core-4.3.1","ajaxplorer-core-4.3.2","ajaxplorer-core-4.3.3","ajaxplorer-core-4.3.4","ajaxplorer-core-5.0.0","ajaxplorer-core-5.0.1","ajaxplorer-core-5.0.2","ajaxplorer-core-5.0.3","pydio-core-5.1.0","pydio-core-5.1.1","pydio-core-5.2.0","pydio-core-5.2.1","pydio-core-5.2.2","pydio-core-5.2.3","pydio-core-5.2.4","pydio-core-5.2.5","pydio-core-5.3.1","pydio-core-5.3.2","pydio-core-5.3.3","pydio-core-5.3.4","pydio-core-6.0.0","pydio-core-6.0.1","pydio-core-6.0.2","pydio-core-6.0.3","pydio-core-6.0.4","pydio-core-6.0.5","pydio-core-6.0.6","pydio-core-6.0.7","pydio-core-6.0.8","pydio-core-6.2.0","pydio-core-6.2.1","pydio-core-6.2.2","pydio-core-6.2.2rc","pydio-core-6.2.2rc2","pydio-core-6.2.2rc3","pydio-core-6.3.1","pydio-core-6.4.0","pydio-core-6.4.0rc1","pydio-core-6.4.0rc2","pydio-core-6.4.0rc3","pydio-core-6.4.1","pydio-core-6.4.2","pydio-core-6.4.2rc1","pydio-core-6.5.1","pydio-core-6.5.2","pydio-core-6.5.3","pydio-core-6.5.4","pydio-core-6.5.5","pydio-core-7.0.0","pydio-core-7.0.1","pydio-core-7.0.2","pydio-core-7.0.3","pydio-core-7.0.4","pydio-core-8.0.0","pydio-core-8.0.1","pydio-core-8.0.2","pydio-core-8.2.0","pydio-core-8.2.1","pydio-core-8.2.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-10047.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.secureauth.com/labs/advisories"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
