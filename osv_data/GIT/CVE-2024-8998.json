The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f2bfa036caf2c48686474f4560a9c5abcf5f43b7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-8998.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/4dbd8648-1dca-4f95-b74f-978ef030e97e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/f2bfa036caf2c48686474f4560a9c5abcf5f43b7"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
