  "details": "ansibleguy-webui is an open source WebUI for using Ansible. Multiple forms in versions < 0.0.21 allowed injection of HTML elements. These are returned to the user after executing job actions and thus evaluated by the browser. These issues have been addressed in version 0.0.21 (0.0.21.post2 on pypi). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for these issues.",
