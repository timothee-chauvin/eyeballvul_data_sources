{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-67748","published":"2025-12-16T00:39:13.968Z","modified":"2026-01-04T05:42:11.975999Z","aliases":["GHSA-r7v6-mfhq-g3m2"],"summary":"Fickling has Code Injection vulnerability via pty.spawn()","details":"Fickling is a Python pickling decompiler and static analyzer. Versions prior to 0.1.6 had a bypass caused by `pty` missing from the block list of unsafe module imports. This led to unsafe pickles based on `pty.spawn()` being incorrectly flagged as `LIKELY_SAFE`, and was fixed in version 0.1.6. This impacted any user or system that used Fickling to vet pickle files for security issues.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8249522c7180c69436516ff81bff394f62298c0c"}]}],"versions":["master","v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67748.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67748.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/pull/108"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/pull/187"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/security/advisories/GHSA-r7v6-mfhq-g3m2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67748"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-184","CWE-502","CWE-94"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67748.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
