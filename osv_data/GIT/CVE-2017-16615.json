When processing YAML-Based queries for data, a YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution because load is used where safe_load should have been used. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/thanethomson/mlalchemy","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bc795757febdcce430d89f9d08f75c32d6989d3c"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.2.0","v0.2.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-16615.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://joel-malwarebenchmark.github.io/blog/2017/11/08/cve-2017-16615-critical-restful-web-applications-vulnerability/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/thanethomson/MLAlchemy/commit/bc795757febdcce430d89f9d08f75c32d6989d3c"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/thanethomson/MLAlchemy/issues/1"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
