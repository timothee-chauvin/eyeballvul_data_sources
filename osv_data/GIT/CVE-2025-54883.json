{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-54883","published":"2025-08-05T23:36:27Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:39:51.880475Z","aliases":["GHSA-c9xg-x7h3-mq2q"],"summary":"Vision UI's security-kit Contains Cryptographic Weakness","details":"Vision UI is a collection of enterprise-grade, dependency-free modules for modern web projects. In versions 1.4.0 and below, the getSecureRandomInt function in security-kit versions prior to 3.5.0 (packaged in Vision-ui <= 1.4.0) contains a critical cryptographic weakness. Due to a silent 32-bit integer overflow in its internal masking logic, the function fails to produce a uniform distribution of random numbers when the requested range between min and max is larger than 2³². The root cause is the use of a 32-bit bitwise left-shift operation (<<) to generate a bitmask for the rejection sampling algorithm. This causes the mask to be incorrect for any range requiring 32 or more bits of entropy. This issue is fixed in version 1.5.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/davidosipov/vision-ui","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f3e67769b7ded045d2feb48f2ad85cba991f02d5"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54883.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DavidOsipov/Vision-ui/commit/347355859f05e98047efbd96fc0e61b9191324f1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DavidOsipov/Vision-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-c9xg-x7h3-mq2q"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-338"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
