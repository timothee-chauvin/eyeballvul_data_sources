Ability to exploit could be triggered by a specific user action (leading to unauthorized JavaScript code execution) if the attacker managed to insert a malicious content into the editor, which might happen with a very specific editor configuration. This vulnerability affects installations where the editor configuration meets one of the following criteria: the HTML embed plugin is enabled, or there is a custom plugin introducing an editable element where view RawElement is enabled. This issue is fixed in versions 45.2.2 and 46.0.3 of both ckeditor5 and ckeditor5-clipboard.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5","events":[{"introduced":"dbfa58ae1555371afa7850fa31e5400e7729390c"},{"fixed":"ef1998b371b9a7bd5c33cea8d370445509e3298a"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5","events":[{"introduced":"6b7f659ce35b095ed28274bf904ab1b7fcfbabe0"},{"fixed":"b710f224d84cfd3174a7e1ae50055292bde75516"}]}],"versions":["v44.2.0","v44.2.1","v44.3.0","v45.0.0","v45.1.0","v45.2.0","v45.2.1","v46.0.0","v46.0.1","v46.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58064.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-x9gp-vjh6-3wv6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/b210e90c6cf84e662ef6c7daf93a92355a961bf2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
