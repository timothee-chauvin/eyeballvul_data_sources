In affected versions http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-splitting attacks when untrusted user input is used to create any of the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`å), Header values (`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI paths (`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through 0.21). This issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5, 0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27 perform the following. As a matter of practice http4s services and client applications should sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a request or response to the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters are the most threatening.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/http4s/http4s","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d02007db1da4f8f3df2dbf11f1db9ac7afc3f9d8"}]}],"versions":["scalafix-v0.20.0","v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.11.2","v0.11.3","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.12.3","v0.12.4","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.13.3","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.10","v0.14.11","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.14.4","v0.14.5","v0.14.6","v0.14.7","v0.14.8","v0.14.9","v0.15.0","v0.15.10","v0.15.11","v0.15.12","v0.15.13","v0.15.14","v0.15.15","v0.15.16","v0.15.2","v0.15.3","v0.15.4","v0.15.5","v0.15.6","v0.15.7","v0.15.8","v0.15.9","v0.16.0","v0.16.0-M1","v0.16.0-M2","v0.16.0-M3","v0.16.0-RC1","v0.16.0-RC2","v0.16.0-RC3","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.16.3","v0.16.4","v0.16.5","v0.16.6","v0.17.0","v0.17.0-M1","v0.17.0-M2","v0.17.0-M3","v0.17.0-RC1","v0.17.0-RC2","v0.17.0-RC3","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.17.3","v0.17.4","v0.17.5","v0.17.6","v0.18.0","v0.18.0-M1","v0.18.0-M2","v0.18.0-M3","v0.18.0-M4","v0.18.0-M5","v0.18.0-M6","v0.18.0-M7","v0.18.0-M8","v0.18.0-M9","v0.18.1","v0.18.10","v0.18.11","v0.18.12","v0.18.13","v0.18.14","v0.18.15","v0.18.16","v0.18.17","v0.18.18","v0.18.19","v0.18.2","v0.18.20","v0.18.21","v0.18.22","v0.18.23","v0.18.24","v0.18.25","v0.18.26","v0.18.3","v0.18.4","v0.18.5","v0.18.6","v0.18.7","v0.18.8","v0.18.9","v0.19.0","v0.19.0-M1","v0.19.0-M2","v0.19.0-M3","v0.19.0-M4","v0.2.0","v0.20.0","v0.20.0-M1","v0.20.0-M2","v0.20.0-M3","v0.20.0-M4","v0.20.0-M5","v0.20.0-M6","v0.20.0-M7","v0.20.0-RC1","v0.20.1","v0.20.10","v0.20.11","v0.20.12","v0.20.13","v0.20.14","v0.20.15","v0.20.16","v0.20.17","v0.20.18","v0.20.19","v0.20.2","v0.20.20","v0.20.21","v0.20.22","v0.20.23","v0.20.3","v0.20.4","v0.20.6","v0.20.7","v0.20.8","v0.20.9","v0.21.0","v0.21.0-M1","v0.21.0-M2","v0.21.0-M3","v0.21.0-M4","v0.21.0-M5","v0.21.0-M6","v0.21.0-RC1","v0.21.0-RC2","v0.21.0-RC3","v0.21.0-RC4","v0.21.0-RC5","v0.21.1","v0.21.11","v0.21.12","v0.21.13","v0.21.14","v0.21.15","v0.21.16","v0.21.18","v0.21.19","v0.21.2","v0.21.20","v0.21.21","v0.21.22","v0.21.23","v0.21.24","v0.21.25","v0.21.26","v0.21.27","v0.21.28","v0.21.3","v0.21.4","v0.21.5","v0.21.6","v0.21.7","v0.21.8","v0.21.9","v0.22.0","v0.22.0-M1","v0.22.0-M2","v0.22.0-M3","v0.22.0-M4","v0.22.0-M5","v0.22.0-M6","v0.22.0-M7","v0.22.0-M8","v0.22.0-RC1","v0.22.1","v0.22.2","v0.22.3","v0.22.4","v0.23.0","v0.23.0-M1","v0.23.0-RC1","v0.23.1","v0.23.2","v0.23.3","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.8.5","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v1.0.0-M1","v1.0.0-M10","v1.0.0-M11","v1.0.0-M12","v1.0.0-M13","v1.0.0-M14","v1.0.0-M15","v1.0.0-M16","v1.0.0-M17","v1.0.0-M18","v1.0.0-M19","v1.0.0-M2","v1.0.0-M20","v1.0.0-M21","v1.0.0-M22","v1.0.0-M23","v1.0.0-M24","v1.0.0-M25","v1.0.0-M26","v1.0.0-M3","v1.0.0-M4","v1.0.0-M5","v1.0.0-M6","v1.0.0-M7","v1.0.0-M8","v1.0.0-M9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-41084.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/http4s/http4s/commit/d02007db1da4f8f3df2dbf11f1db9ac7afc3f9d8"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/http4s/http4s/security/advisories/GHSA-5vcm-3xc3-w7x3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://httpwg.org/http-core/draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics-latest.html#fields.values"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/HTTP_Response_Splitting"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
