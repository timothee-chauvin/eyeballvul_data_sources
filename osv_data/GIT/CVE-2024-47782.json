{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-47782","published":"2024-10-07T21:28:01.299Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:35:38.151596Z","aliases":["GHSA-wf48-rqx3-39mf"],"summary":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in Special:WikiDiscover when displaying wiki information in WikiDiscover","details":"WikiDiscover is an extension designed for use with a CreateWiki managed farm to display wikis. Special:WikiDiscover is a special page that lists all wikis on the wiki farm. However, the special page does not make any effort to escape the wiki name or description. Therefore, if a wiki sets its name and/or description to an XSS payload, the XSS will execute whenever the wiki is shown on Special:WikiDiscover. This issue has been patched with commit `2ce846dd93` and all users are advised to apply that patch. User unable to upgrade should block access to `Special:WikiDiscover`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/miraheze/wikidiscover","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2ce846dd93ddb9ec86f7472c4d57fe71a09dc827"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47782.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/commit/2ce846dd93ddb9ec86f7472c4d57fe71a09dc827"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/security/advisories/GHSA-wf48-rqx3-39mf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/T12697"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79","CWE-80"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L"}]}
