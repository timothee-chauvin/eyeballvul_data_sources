Versions 4.8.0 through 4.9.5 contain a flaw in the getPath utility function which could allow path confusion and potential bypass of proxy-level ACLs (e.g. Nginx location blocks). The original implementation relied on fixed character offsets when parsing request URLs. Under certain malformed absolute-form Request-URIs, this could lead to incorrect path extraction depending on the application and environment. If proxy ACLs are used to protect sensitive endpoints such as /admin, this flaw could have allowed unauthorized access. The confidentiality impact depends on what data is exposed: if sensitive administrative data is exposed, the impact may be high, otherwise it may be moderate. This issue is fixed in version 4.9.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/honojs/hono","events":[{"introduced":"946fcf488f3909b1f5444f70f236f0c5db78636b"},{"fixed":"7f4311c010dbd15bd25e16551ecf58059887d105"}]}],"versions":["v4.8.0","v4.8.1","v4.8.10","v4.8.11","v4.8.12","v4.8.2","v4.8.3","v4.8.4","v4.8.5","v4.8.6","v4.8.7","v4.8.8","v4.8.9","v4.9.0","v4.9.1","v4.9.2","v4.9.3","v4.9.4","v4.9.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58362.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/honojs/hono/security/advisories/GHSA-9hp6-4448-45g2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/honojs/hono/commit/1d79aedc3f82d8c9969b115fe61bc4bd705ec8de"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/honojs/hono/releases/tag/v4.9.6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-706"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
