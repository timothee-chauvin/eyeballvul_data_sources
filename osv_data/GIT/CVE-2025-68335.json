Thus, any such dereferencing of\n&s->async->cmd will lead to general protection fault and kernel crash.\n\nMitigate this problem by removing a call to pcl818_ai_cancel() from\npcl818_detach() altogether. This way, if the subdevice setups its\nsupport for async commands, everything async-related will be\nhandled via subdevice's own ->cancel() function in\ncomedi_device_detach_locked() even before pcl818_detach(). If no\nsupport for asynchronous commands is provided, there is no need\nto cancel anything either.\n\n[1] Syzbot crash:\nOops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address
