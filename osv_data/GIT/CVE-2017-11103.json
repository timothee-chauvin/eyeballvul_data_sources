In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be obtained from the encrypted version stored in 'enc_part' instead of the unencrypted version stored in 'ticket'. Use of the unencrypted version provides an opportunity for successful server impersonation and other attacks. NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that embed Heimdal code; it does not apply to other instances in which this part of the Kerberos 5 protocol specification is violated.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a3d72c604378e0bff787cc426f2b17f75b112dce"}]}],"versions":["git2svn-syncpoint-master","heimdal-1.3.0pre1","heimdal-1.3.0pre10","heimdal-1.3.0pre11","heimdal-1.3.0pre3","heimdal-1.3.0pre4","heimdal-1.3.0pre5","heimdal-1.3.0pre6","heimdal-1.3.0pre7","heimdal-1.3.0pre8","heimdal-1.3.0pre9","heimdal-1.3.0rc1","heimdal-1.5pre1","heimdal-1.5pre2","heimdal-7.0.1","heimdal-7.0.2","heimdal-7.0.3","heimdal-7.1.0","heimdal-7.1rc1","heimdal-7.2.0","heimdal-7.3.0","switch-from-svn-to-git","upstream-1.4.0+git20101228.dfsg.1","upstream-1.4.0+git20110220.dfsg.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-11103.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/samba-team/samba","events":[{"introduced":"df33344d8eb40221d60c99931690703a11d91bc2"},{"fixed":"9fb0aa56baf317c5bf18417c5516f951207af82d"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-11103.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3912"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.h5l.org/advisories.html?show=2017-07-11"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99551"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038876"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039427"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/releases/tag/heimdal-7.4.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.apple.com/HT208112"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.apple.com/HT208144"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.apple.com/HT208221"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-17:05.heimdal.asc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.orpheus-lyre.info/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2017-11103.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
