A bug introduced in 9.7.0 increases the memory consumed when reading from the network into JavaScript using the net.Socket object directly as a stream. An attacker could use this cause a denial of service by sending tiny chunks of data in short succession. This vulnerability was restored by reverting to the prior behaviour.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nodejs/node","events":[{"introduced":"85bbd43fb4930ecaa0c5b0aa248472a781d0eb1e"},{"fixed":"b5339ff549fcd7ff7f228d00d0ff79b78a347dc6"}]}],"versions":["v9.10.0","v9.10.1","v9.11.0","v9.11.1","v9.7.0","v9.7.1","v9.8.0","v9.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-7164.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104463"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/june-2018-security-releases/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-48"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
