{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-39224","published":"2022-09-21T23:10:08Z","modified":"2025-12-04T10:35:13.463365Z","aliases":["GHSA-88cv-mj24-8w3q"],"summary":"Arbitrary shell execution when extracting or listing files contained in a malicious rpm.","details":"Arr-pm is an RPM reader/writer library written in Ruby. Versions prior to 0.0.12 are subject to OS command injection resulting in shell execution if the RPM contains a malicious \"payload compressor\" field. This vulnerability impacts the `extract` and `files` methods of the `RPM::File` class of this library. Version 0.0.12 patches these issues. A workaround for this issue is to ensure any RPMs being processed contain valid/known payload compressor values such as gzip, bzip2, xz, zstd, and lzma. The payload compressor field in an rpm can be checked by using the rpm command line tool.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"441764ab706cbf61d55d4ba5b0b04959b635c360"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39224.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/39xxx/CVE-2022-39224.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm/pull/14"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm/pull/15"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm/security/advisories/GHSA-88cv-mj24-8w3q"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39224"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-78"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/39xxx/CVE-2022-39224.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
