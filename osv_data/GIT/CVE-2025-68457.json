{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68457","published":"2025-12-19T16:40:30.258Z","modified":"2025-12-19T20:26:17.900438Z","aliases":["GHSA-72mh-hgpm-6384"],"summary":"Orejime has executable code in HTML attributes","details":"Orejime is a consent manager that focuses on accessibility. On HTML elements handled by Orejime prior to version 2.3.2, one could run malicious code by embedding `javascript:` code within data attributes. When consenting to the related purpose, Orejime would turn data attributes into unprefixed ones (i.e. `data-href` into `href`), thus executing the code. This shouldn't have any impact on most setups, as elements handled by Orejime are generally hardcoded. The problem would only arise if somebody could inject HTML code within pages. The problem has been patched in version 2.3.2. As a workaround, the problem can be fixed outside of Orejime by sanitizing attributes which could contain executable code.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/boscop-fr/orejime","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f55ab7fdbd431f8bda8f1a855fcf19f12c543a00"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.3.2"}]}}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68457.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68457.json"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/boscop-fr/orejime/issues/142"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/boscop-fr/orejime/pull/143"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/boscop-fr/orejime/security/advisories/GHSA-72mh-hgpm-6384"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68457"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68457.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N/E:U"}]}
