Introduce a new icc_bw_lock for cases where\nwe need to serialize bw aggregation and update to decouple that from\npaths that require memory allocation such as node/link creation/\ndestruction.\n\nFixes this lockdep splat:\n\n   ======================================================\n   WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected\n   6.2.0-rc8-debug+ #554
