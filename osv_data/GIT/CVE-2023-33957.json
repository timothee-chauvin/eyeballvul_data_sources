An attacker who has compromised a registry and added a high number of signatures to an artifact can cause denial of service of services on the machine, if a user runs notation inspect command on the same machine. The problem has been fixed in the release v1.0.0-rc.6. Users should upgrade their notation packages to v1.0.0-rc.6 or above. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may restrict container registries to a set of secure and trusted container registries.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/notaryproject/notation","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ed22fde52f6d70ae0b53521bd28c9ccafa868c24"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0-alpha.3","v0.10.0-alpha.3.dev.20220821","v0.10.0-alpha.3.dev.20220828","v0.10.0-alpha.3.dev.20220904","v0.10.0-alpha.3.dev.20220911","v0.10.0-alpha.3.dev.20220918","v0.10.0-alpha.3.dev.20220925","v0.10.0-alpha.3.dev.20220928","v0.10.0-alpha.3.dev.20221002","v0.10.0-alpha.3.dev.20221009","v0.11.0-alpha.4","v0.11.0-alpha.4.dev.20221016","v0.11.0-alpha.4.dev.20221023","v0.11.0-alpha.4.dev.20221030","v0.12.0-beta.1","v0.12.0-beta.1.dev.20221204","v0.7.0-alpha.1","v0.7.1-alpha.1","v0.9.0-alpha.1","v1.0.0-rc.1","v1.0.0-rc.1.dev.20230201","v1.0.0-rc.2","v1.0.0-rc.2.dev.20230226","v1.0.0-rc.3","v1.0.0-rc.4","v1.0.0-rc.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-33957.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"553b866ed4efd3f94cc0f1773cabdab25ff0ef09"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0-alpha.3","v0.11.0-alpha.4","v0.12.0-beta.1","v0.7.0-alpha.1","v0.8.0-alpha.1","v0.9.0-alpha.1","v1.0.0-rc.1","v1.0.0-rc.2","v1.0.0-rc.3","v1.0.0-rc.4","v1.0.0-rc.5","v1.0.0-rc.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-33957.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/commit/ed22fde52f6d70ae0b53521bd28c9ccafa868c24"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/security/advisories/GHSA-9m3v-v4r5-ppx7"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
