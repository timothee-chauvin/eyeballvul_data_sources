{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2020-27217","published":"2020-11-13T20:15:16.270Z","modified":"2025-11-20T11:23:19.856131Z","aliases":["GHSA-9f52-hpvw-v96w"],"details":"In Eclipse Hono version 1.3.0 and 1.4.0 the AMQP protocol adapter does not verify the size of AMQP messages received from devices. In particular, a device may send messages that are bigger than the max-message-size that the protocol adapter has indicated during link establishment. While the AMQP 1.0 protocol explicitly disallows a peer to send such messages, a hand crafted AMQP 1.0 client could exploit this behavior in order to send a message of unlimited size to the adapter, eventually causing the adapter to fail with an out of memory exception.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/eclipse/hono","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2f415ce12c92c23aac42ac92d4652550e0b7f252"},{"last_affected":"4026e3b5e28e381064ccfb3679f012729c3d5e1d"}]}],"versions":["0.5","0.5-M1","0.5-M10","0.5-M2","0.5-M3","0.5-M4","0.5-M5","0.5-M6","0.5-M7","0.5-M8","0.5-M9","0.6","0.6-M1","0.6-M2","0.7","0.7-M1","0.7-M2","0.8","0.8-M1","0.8-M1_1","0.8-M2","0.9","0.9-M1","0.9-M2","1.0-M1","1.0-M2","1.0-M3","1.0-M4","1.0-M5","1.0-M6","1.0-M7","1.0.0","1.1.0","1.1.0-M1","1.1.0-M2","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.3.0-M1","1.3.0-M2","1.3.0-M3","1.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-27217.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=567068"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
