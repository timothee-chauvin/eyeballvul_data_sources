I took a\nlook in the commit, but it looks fine to me. So I thought the cause is not\nin the commit diff.\n\nI found the WARN is printed when the f2fs is set up with multiple devices,\nand read requests are mapped to the very first block of the second device in the\ndirect read path. In this case, f2fs_map_blocks() and f2fs_map_blocks_cached()\nmodify map->m_pblk as the physical block address from each block device. It\nbecomes zero when it is mapped to the first block of the device. However,\nf2fs_iomap_begin() assumes that map->m_pblk is the physical block address of the\nwhole f2fs, across the all block devices. It compares map->m_pblk against\nNULL_ADDR == 0, then go into the unexpected branch and sets the invalid\niomap->length. The WARN catches the invalid iomap->length.\n\nThis WARN is printed even for non-zoned block devices, by following steps.\n\n - Create two (non-zoned) null_blk devices memory backed with 128MB size each:\n   nullb0 and nullb1.\n # mkfs.f2fs /dev/nullb0 -c /dev/nullb1\n # mount -t f2fs /dev/nullb0 \"${mount_dir}\"\n # dd if=/dev/zero of=\"${mount_dir}/test.dat\" bs=1M count=192\n # dd if=\"${mount_dir}/test.dat\" of=/dev/null bs=1M count=192 iflag=direct\n\n...\"\n\nSo, the root cause of this issue is: when multi-devices feature is on,\nf2fs_map_blocks() may return zero blkaddr in non-primary device, which is\na verified valid block address, however, f2fs_iomap_begin() treats it as\nan invalid block address, and then it triggers the warning in iomap\nframework code.\n\nFinally, as discussed, we decide to use a more simple and direct way that\nchecking (map.m_flags & F2FS_MAP_MAPPED) condition instead of\n(map.m_pblk != NULL_ADDR) to fix this issue.\n\nThanks a lot for the effort of Yi Zhang and Shinichiro Kawasaki on this\nissue.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-f2fs-devel/CAHj4cs-kfojYC9i0G73PRkYzcxCTex=-vugRFeP40g_URGvnfQ@mail.gmail.com/\n[2]
