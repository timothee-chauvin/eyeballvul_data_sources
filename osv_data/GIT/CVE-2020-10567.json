  "details": "An issue was discovered in Responsive Filemanager through 9.14.0. In the ajax_calls.php file in the save_img action in the name parameter, there is no validation of what kind of extension is sent. This makes it possible to execute PHP code if a legitimate JPEG image contains this code in the EXIF data, and the .php extension is used in the name parameter. (A potential fast patch is to disable the save_img action in the config file.)",
