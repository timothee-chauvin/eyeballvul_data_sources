Starting in version 1.8.0 and prior to version 1.40.4, Deno improperly checks that an import specifier's hostname is equal to or a child of a token's hostname, which can cause tokens to be sent to servers they shouldn't be sent to. An auth token intended for `example[.]com` may be sent to `notexample[.]com`. Anyone who uses DENO_AUTH_TOKENS and imports potentially untrusted code is affected. Version 1.40.0 contains a patch for this issue","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/denoland/deno","events":[{"introduced":"18b894072d3eb6b04016e77ece0d78512f7ffca1"},{"fixed":"49214d309fc373a80a02f57545131b15f7813a98"}]}],"versions":["v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.3","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.14.2","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.15.2","v1.15.3","v1.16.0","v1.16.1","v1.16.2","v1.17.0","v1.18.0","v1.19.0","v1.20.0","v1.20.1","v1.21.0","v1.22.0","v1.23.0","v1.24.0","v1.25.0","v1.26.0","v1.27.0","v1.28.0","v1.29.0","v1.30.0","v1.31.0","v1.32.0","v1.33.0","v1.34.0","v1.35.0","v1.36.0","v1.37.0","v1.38.0","v1.39.0","v1.40.0","v1.40.1","v1.40.2","v1.40.3","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-27932.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/3f4639c330a31741b0efda2f93ebbb833f4f95bc/cli/auth_tokens.rs#L89"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/de23e3b60b066481cc390f459497d5bef42a899b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-5frw-4rwq-xhcr"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
