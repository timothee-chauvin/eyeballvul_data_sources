In striptags before version 3.2.0, a type-confusion vulnerability can cause `striptags` to concatenate unsanitized strings when an array-like object is passed in as the `html` parameter. This can be abused by an attacker who can control the shape of their input, e.g. if query parameters are passed directly into the function. This can lead to a XSS.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ericnorris/striptags","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f252a6b0819499cd65403707ebaf5cc925f2faca"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.2.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.1.0","v3.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32696.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ericnorris/striptags/commit/f252a6b0819499cd65403707ebaf5cc925f2faca"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ericnorris/striptags/releases/tag/v3.2.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ericnorris/striptags/security/advisories/GHSA-qxg5-2qff-p49r"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/striptags"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
