The new behaviour is to have an empty ACL file mean that all access is denied, which is not a useful configuration but is not unexpected.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"66dfa573946425661626e2f574ef125ab01b01f5"}]}],"versions":["v1.4","v1.4.1","v1.4.10","v1.4.11","v1.4.12","v1.4.13","v1.4.14","v1.4.15","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.4.7","v1.4.8","v1.4.9","v1.5","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-12550.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=541870"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/10/msg00035.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
