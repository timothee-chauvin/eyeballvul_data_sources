When logging in as a user with SSO enabled an attacker may authenticate as an other user. Any user account which does not have a second factor enabled could be compromised. This issue has been addressed in commit `8173f6512a` and in releases starting with version 0.7.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should require their users to use a second factor in authentication.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"dca24110f95795533098a36f69869c926e5c9c03"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v0.6.6","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-37268.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate/security/advisories/GHSA-868r-97g5-r9g4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate/commit/8173f6512ab6183fa5edc5c9a5f3760b8979271e"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
