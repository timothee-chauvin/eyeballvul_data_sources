{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-45053","published":"2024-09-04T16:04:03Z","modified":"2025-11-11T02:34:34Z","aliases":["GHSA-c34r-238x-f7qx"],"summary":"Remote Code Execution Vulnerability via SSTI in Fides Webserver Jinja Email Templating Engine","details":"Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. Starting in version 2.19.0 and prior to version 2.44.0, the Email Templating feature uses Jinja2 without proper input sanitization or rendering environment restrictions, allowing for Server-Side Template Injection that grants Remote Code Execution to privileged users. A privileged user refers to an Admin UI user with the default `Owner` or `Contributor` role, who can escalate their access and execute code on the underlying Fides Webserver container where the Jinja template rendering function is executed. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.44.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There are no workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ethyca/fides","events":[{"introduced":"9889a69e3d2e914611cd0ccfe8493d5fcb2f5390"},{"fixed":"fec148431fe79e8a5a2b4d1c22e6c8624dcc5dca"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45053.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/829cbd9cb5ef9c814fbac1ed6800e8d939d359c5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-c34r-238x-f7qx"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1336"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
