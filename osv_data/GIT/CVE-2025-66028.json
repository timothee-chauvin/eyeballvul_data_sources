Prior to version 8.0.5567, OneUptime is vulnerable to privilege escalation via Login Response Manipulation. During the login process, the server response included a parameter called isMasterAdmin. By intercepting and modifying this parameter value from false to true, it is possible to gain access to the admin dashboard interface. However, an attacker may be unable to view or interact with the data if they still do not have sufficient permissions. This issue has been patched in version 8.0.5567.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oneuptime/oneuptime","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"863f1ae82eec081bcb87637e0b077052b697bc4c"}]}],"versions":["${CI_PIPELINE_ID}","6.0.$CI_PIPELINE_ID","6.0.1","6.0.12","6.0.14","6.0.15","6.0.17","6.0.18","6.0.19","6.0.2","6.0.20","6.0.21","6.0.22","6.0.23","6.0.24","6.0.25","6.0.26","6.0.27","6.0.28","7.0.1000","7.0.1004","7.0.1039","7.0.104","7.0.1055","7.0.106","7.0.1078","7.0.109","7.0.1093","7.0.11","7.0.112","7.0.114","7.0.1143","7.0.1144","7.0.1167","7.0.1174","7.0.1183","7.0.1184","7.0.119","7.0.1191","7.0.1192","7.0.1195","7.0.122","7.0.1225","7.0.1229","7.0.123","7.0.1230","7.0.1243","7.0.1246","7.0.126","7.0.1265","7.0.1290","7.0.1295","7.0.1297","7.0.130","7.0.131","7.0.1326","7.0.1327","7.0.134","7.0.1341","7.0.1353","7.0.137","7.0.1375","7.0.1377","7.0.1378","7.0.1379","7.0.1383","7.0.1388","7.0.139","7.0.1390","7.0.1392","7.0.1393","7.0.1403","7.0.141","7.0.1414","7.0.1430","7.0.1436","7.0.144","7.0.1441","7.0.1461","7.0.1469","7.0.149","7.0.1491","7.0.1494","7.0.1497","7.0.1498","7.0.1499","7.0.1500","7.0.1502","7.0.1505","7.0.1506","7.0.1510","7.0.1513","7.0.1514","7.0.1517","7.0.1528","7.0.1529","7.0.1544","7.0.155","7.0.1555","7.0.1557","7.0.1568","7.0.157","7.0.1581","7.0.1585","7.0.1586","7.0.160","7.0.162","7.0.1633","7.0.1637","7.0.1638","7.0.1642","7.0.1643","7.0.165","7.0.167","7.0.1688","7.0.169","7.0.1694","7.0.1697","7.0.1708","7.0.1709","7.0.1717","7.0.173","7.0.1733","7.0.1740","7.0.1741","7.0.1744","7.0.1745","7.0.1751","7.0.1752","7.0.1758","7.0.1762","7.0.1763","7.0.1765","7.0.1767","7.0.1769","7.0.1775","7.0.1780","7.0.1787","7.0.179","7.0.1790","7.0.1791","7.0.1792","7.0.1794","7.0.1797","7.0.18","7.0.1800","7.0.1803","7.0.1814","7.0.1815","7.0.182","7.0.1829","7.0.183","7.0.1830","7.0.1843","7.0.1852","7.0.1854","7.0.1856","7.0.1858","7.0.1860","7.0.1862","7.0.1866","7.0.1867","7.0.1870","7.0.1871","7.0.1874","7.0.1880","7.0.1881","7.0.1886","7.0.1888","7.0.1891","7.0.1894","7.0.1901","7.0.1902","7.0.1910","7.0.1914","7.0.1916","7.0.1920","7.0.1921","7.0.1924","7.0.1929","7.0.193","7.0.1930","7.0.1931","7.0.1934","7.0.1935","7.0.1940","7.0.1945","7.0.1947","7.0.1948","7.0.1965","7.0.1966","7.0.197","7.0.1978","7.0.1982","7.0.1985","7.0.1987","7.0.1989","7.0.200","7.0.2004","7.0.2009","7.0.201","7.0.2012","7.0.2014","7.0.2016","7.0.2018","7.0.2022","7.0.2032","7.0.2033","7.0.204","7.0.2051","7.0.2055","7.0.2057","7.0.2062","7.0.2063","7.0.2066","7.0.207","7.0.2084","7.0.2086","7.0.2088","7.0.2091","7.0.2092","7.0.21","7.0.2118","7.0.213","7.0.2171","7.0.2177","7.0.2178","7.0.2186","7.0.219","7.0.2190","7.0.2191","7.0.2195","7.0.2196","7.0.2200","7.0.2207","7.0.2223","7.0.2224","7.0.2231","7.0.2233","7.0.2237","7.0.2239","7.0.224","7.0.2240","7.0.2243","7.0.2246","7.0.2270","7.0.2279","7.0.228","7.0.2281","7.0.2282","7.0.2286","7.0.2287","7.0.2290","7.0.2292","7.0.2293","7.0.2296","7.0.2299","7.0.2302","7.0.2305","7.0.231","7.0.2314","7.0.2317","7.0.2319","7.0.2320","7.0.2327","7.0.2335","7.0.2338","7.0.2341","7.0.2346","7.0.2349","7.0.2354","7.0.2358","7.0.2361","7.0.2363","7.0.2371","7.0.2372","7.0.2374","7.0.2377","7.0.2380","7.0.239","7.0.2401","7.0.2402","7.0.2410","7.0.2446","7.0.2448","7.0.2449","7.0.2471","7.0.2473","7.0.2475","7.0.2476","7.0.2478","7.0.2479","7.0.2482","7.0.2487","7.0.2509","7.0.2513","7.0.2525","7.0.2550","7.0.2571","7.0.2572","7.0.2574","7.0.2589","7.0.2599","7.0.2620","7.0.2625","7.0.2628","7.0.2639","7.0.2643","7.0.2666","7.0.2721","7.0.2725","7.0.2730","7.0.2774","7.0.2825","7.0.2828","7.0.2832","7.0.2837","7.0.2846","7.0.2873","7.0.2875","7.0.2885","7.0.290","7.0.2901","7.0.2903","7.0.2908","7.0.291","7.0.2913","7.0.2920","7.0.2923","7.0.2928","7.0.2936","7.0.294","7.0.296","7.0.297","7.0.2972","7.0.2976","7.0.298","7.0.2981","7.0.2986","7.0.2988","7.0.2994","7.0.3010","7.0.3018","7.0.3026","7.0.3035","7.0.3038","7.0.3040","7.0.3052","7.0.3064","7.0.3076","7.0.3080","7.0.3086","7.0.3095","7.0.3113","7.0.3124","7.0.3126","7.0.3129","7.0.3140","7.0.3148","7.0.315","7.0.3153","7.0.3158","7.0.316","7.0.3163","7.0.3176","7.0.318","7.0.3188","7.0.3198","7.0.3200","7.0.3202","7.0.3206","7.0.321","7.0.3211","7.0.3212","7.0.3225","7.0.3227","7.0.3237","7.0.324","7.0.3240","7.0.3242","7.0.3245","7.0.3250","7.0.3260","7.0.3278","7.0.3279","7.0.328","7.0.3291","7.0.3300","7.0.3309","7.0.333","7.0.3330","7.0.3336","7.0.3338","7.0.334","7.0.3343","7.0.335","7.0.3350","7.0.3351","7.0.3357","7.0.336","7.0.3365","7.0.3377","7.0.3387","7.0.339","7.0.3393","7.0.3403","7.0.3405","7.0.341","7.0.3413","7.0.3426","7.0.3437","7.0.344","7.0.3442","7.0.3445","7.0.3448","7.0.3453","7.0.3456","7.0.346","7.0.3464","7.0.3471","7.0.348","7.0.3480","7.0.35","7.0.350","7.0.3515","7.0.3517","7.0.352","7.0.3526","7.0.3538","7.0.354","7.0.3546","7.0.3548","7.0.3549","7.0.355","7.0.3557","7.0.3565","7.0.3579","7.0.358","7.0.3599","7.0.360","7.0.361","7.0.3611","7.0.3617","7.0.362","7.0.363","7.0.3
