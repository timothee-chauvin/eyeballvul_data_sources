An attacker listening in on the channel can collect both 'encUsageAuth' and 'encMigrationAuth', and then can calculate 'usageAuth ^ encMigrationAuth' as the 'migrationAuth' can be guessed for all keys created with CreateWrapKey. TPM2.0 is not impacted by this. We recommend updating your library to 0.3.0 or later, or, if you cannot update, to call CreateWrapKey with a random 20-byte value for 'migrationAuth'.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/google/go-tpm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d7806cce857a1a020190c03348e5361725d8f141"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-8918.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/google/go-tpm/security/advisories/GHSA-5x29-3hr9-6wpw"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
