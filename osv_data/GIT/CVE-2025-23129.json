This does no harm unless one of the functions\nrequesting the IRQ fails and attempt to free the IRQ. This results in the\nbelow warning:\n\nWARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 349 at kernel/irq/manage.c:1929 free_irq+0x278/0x29c\nCall trace:\n free_irq+0x278/0x29c\n ath11k_pcic_free_irq+0x70/0x10c [ath11k]\n ath11k_pci_probe+0x800/0x820 [ath11k_pci]\n local_pci_probe+0x40/0xbc\n\nThe warning is due to not clearing the affinity hint before freeing the\nIRQs.\n\nSo to fix this issue, clear the IRQ affinity hint before calling\nath11k_pcic_free_irq() in the error path. The affinity will be cleared once\nagain further down the error path due to code organization, but that does\nno harm.\n\nTested-on: QCA6390 hw2.0 PCI
