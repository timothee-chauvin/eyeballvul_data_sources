{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2018-10897","published":"2018-08-01T17:29:00.457Z","modified":"2025-12-21T16:19:27.934346Z","details":"A directory traversal issue was found in reposync, a part of yum-utils, where reposync fails to sanitize paths in remote repository configuration files. If an attacker controls a repository, they may be able to copy files outside of the destination directory on the targeted system via path traversal. If reposync is running with heightened privileges on a targeted system, this flaw could potentially result in system compromise via the overwriting of critical system files. Version 1.1.31 and older are believed to be affected.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-10897.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rpm-software-management/yum-utils","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6a8de061f8fdc885e74ebe8c94625bf53643b71c"},{"fixed":"7554c0133eb830a71dc01846037cc047d0acbc2c"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-10897.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041594"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2284"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2285"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2626"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-10897"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rpm-software-management/yum-utils/commit/6a8de061f8fdc885e74ebe8c94625bf53643b71c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rpm-software-management/yum-utils/commit/7554c0133eb830a71dc01846037cc047d0acbc2c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rpm-software-management/yum-utils/pull/43"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
