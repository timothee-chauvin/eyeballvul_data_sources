In versions prior to 1.0.9, XML parsing performed by the UcumEssenceService is vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where ucum is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. Release 1.0.9 of Ucum-java fixes this vulnerability. As a workaround, ensure that the source xml for instantiating UcumEssenceService is trusted.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/fhir/ucum-java","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c2ede4af8795d5b6b450a85324bb305ca1524500"}]}],"versions":["1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","v1.0.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-55887.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FHIR/Ucum-java/security/advisories/GHSA-w9j7-phm3-f97j"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-611"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
