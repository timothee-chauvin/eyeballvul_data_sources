The Samba smbd file server must map Windows group identities (SIDs) into unix group ids (gids). The code that performs this had a flaw that could allow it to read data beyond the end of the array in the case where a negative cache entry had been added to the mapping cache. This could cause the calling code to return those values into the process token that stores the group membership for a user. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/samba-team/samba","events":[{"introduced":"b1d9ddf738c6e59e489bc9c339ce6de5988b689e"},{"fixed":"703c6301013f78e80882abfe8375d6a45a176b7f"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-20254.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1949442"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/05/msg00023.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-22"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210430-0001/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-20254.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3EP2VJ73OVBPVSOSTVOMGIEQA3MWF6F7/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZAF6L2M6CNAJ2YYYGXPWETTW5YLCWTVT/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
