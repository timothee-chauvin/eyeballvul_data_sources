When a LedgerSMB database administrator has an active session in /setup.pl, an attacker can trick the admin into clicking on a link which automatically submits a request to setup.pl without the admin's consent.  This request can be used to create a new user account with full application (/login.pl) privileges, leading to privilege escalation.  The vulnerability is patched in versions 1.10.30 and 1.11.9.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ledgersmb/ledgersmb","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"561ba72820038003b4b3ccadbb10b3a4fb69e4ab"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.10.30"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ledgersmb/ledgersmb","events":[{"introduced":"01e7041a3f7ccc2e2e3330d155e4ea785ba76d10"},{"fixed":"affcbedcc4d7371195947ef652c20ad54f4623ad"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.11.0"},{"fixed":"1.11.9"}]}}],"versions":["1.10.0","1.10.1","1.10.10","1.10.11","1.10.12","1.10.13","1.10.14","1.10.15","1.10.16","1.10.17","1.10.18","1.10.19","1.10.2","1.10.20","1.10.21","1.10.22","1.10.23","1.10.24","1.10.25","1.10.26","1.10.27","1.10.28","1.10.29","1.10.3","1.10.4","1.10.5","1.10.6","1.10.7","1.10.8","1.10.9","1.11.0","1.11.1","1.11.2","1.11.3","1.11.4","1.11.5","1.11.6","1.11.7","1.11.8","1.3.42","1.4.0-rc2","1.4.1","1.4.12","1.4.7","1.4.7-rc1","1.4.8-rc2","1.4.9-2","1.5-beta2","1.5.0-beta1","1.5.0-beta3","1.5.0-beta4","1.5.0-beta5","1.5.0-beta6","1.7.0-alpha1","1.7.0-beta1","v.1.3.41"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-23831.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/23xxx/CVE-2024-23831.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/commit/8c2ae5be68a782d62cb9c0e17c0127bf30ef4165"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/security/advisories/GHSA-98ff-f638-qxjm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23831"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-352"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/23xxx/CVE-2024-23831.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
