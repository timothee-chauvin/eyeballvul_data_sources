In versions 4.2.0 through 7.5.3, and 8.0.0 through 8.3.1-alpha.1, there is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the file upload functionality when trying to upload a Parse.File with uri parameter, allowing execution of an arbitrary URI. The vulnerability stems from a file upload feature in which Parse Server retrieves the file data from a URI that is provided in the request. A request to the provided URI is executed, but the response is not stored in Parse Server's file storage as the server crashes upon receiving the response. This issue is fixed in versions 7.5.4 and 8.4.0-alpha.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server","events":[{"introduced":"1045eeb700798ac081b1d0731963312647daa436"},{"fixed":"c9333dd7bc45eb9009649358db78ca66c6b8a2d5"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"4.2.0"},{"fixed":"7.5.4"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server","events":[{"introduced":"3cb3c5f7c628ed5f0598cd33df4abcc612862b98"},{"last_affected":"52bfb186fc4790073ac258bb30a7c599f469471e"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"8.0.0"},{"last_affected":"8.4.0-alpha.1"}]}}],"versions":["4.2.0","4.3.0","4.4.0","4.5.0","5.0.0","5.0.0-alpha.1","5.0.0-alpha.10","5.0.0-alpha.11","5.0.0-alpha.12","5.0.0-alpha.13","5.0.0-alpha.14","5.0.0-alpha.15","5.0.0-alpha.16","5.0.0-alpha.17","5.0.0-alpha.18","5.0.0-alpha.19","5.0.0-alpha.2","5.0.0-alpha.20","5.0.0-alpha.21","5.0.0-alpha.22","5.0.0-alpha.23","5.0.0-alpha.24","5.0.0-alpha.25","5.0.0-alpha.26","5.0.0-alpha.27","5.0.0-alpha.28","5.0.0-alpha.29","5.0.0-alpha.3","5.0.0-alpha.4","5.0.0-alpha.5","5.0.0-alpha.6","5.0.0-alpha.7","5.0.0-alpha.8","5.0.0-alpha.9","5.0.0-beta.1","5.0.0-beta.10","5.0.0-beta.2","5.0.0-beta.3","5.0.0-beta.4","5.0.0-beta.5","5.0.0-beta.6","5.0.0-beta.7","5.0.0-beta.8","5.0.0-beta.9","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.2.0","5.2.0-alpha.1","5.2.0-alpha.2","5.2.0-alpha.3","5.2.0-beta.1","5.2.0-beta.2","5.2.1","5.2.2","5.2.3","5.2.4","5.2.5","5.2.6","5.2.7","5.2.8","5.3.0","5.3.0-alpha.10","5.3.0-alpha.11","5.3.0-alpha.12","5.3.0-alpha.13","5.3.0-alpha.14","5.3.0-alpha.15","5.3.0-alpha.16","5.3.0-alpha.17","5.3.0-alpha.18","5.3.0-alpha.19","5.3.0-alpha.20","5.3.0-alpha.21","5.3.0-alpha.22","5.3.0-alpha.23","5.3.0-alpha.24","5.3.0-alpha.25","5.3.0-alpha.26","5.3.0-alpha.27","5.3.0-alpha.28","5.3.0-alpha.29","5.3.0-alpha.30","5.3.0-alpha.31","5.3.0-alpha.32","5.3.0-alpha.7","5.3.0-alpha.8","5.3.0-alpha.9","5.3.0-beta.1","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.4.0","5.4.0-alpha.1","5.4.0-beta.1","6.0.0","6.0.0-alpha.1","6.0.0-alpha.10","6.0.0-alpha.11","6.0.0-alpha.12","6.0.0-alpha.13","6.0.0-alpha.14","6.0.0-alpha.15","6.0.0-alpha.16","6.0.0-alpha.17","6.0.0-alpha.18","6.0.0-alpha.19","6.0.0-alpha.2","6.0.0-alpha.20","6.0.0-alpha.21","6.0.0-alpha.22","6.0.0-alpha.23","6.0.0-alpha.24","6.0.0-alpha.25","6.0.0-alpha.26","6.0.0-alpha.27","6.0.0-alpha.28","6.0.0-alpha.29","6.0.0-alpha.3","6.0.0-alpha.30","6.0.0-alpha.31","6.0.0-alpha.32","6.0.0-alpha.33","6.0.0-alpha.34","6.0.0-alpha.35","6.0.0-alpha.4","6.0.0-alpha.5","6.0.0-alpha.6","6.0.0-alpha.7","6.0.0-alpha.8","6.0.0-alpha.9","6.0.0-beta.1","6.1.0","6.1.0-alpha.1","6.1.0-alpha.10","6.1.0-alpha.11","6.1.0-alpha.12","6.1.0-alpha.13","6.1.0-alpha.14","6.1.0-alpha.15","6.1.0-alpha.16","6.1.0-alpha.17","6.1.0-alpha.18","6.1.0-alpha.19","6.1.0-alpha.2","6.1.0-alpha.20","6.1.0-alpha.3","6.1.0-alpha.4","6.1.0-alpha.5","6.1.0-alpha.6","6.1.0-alpha.7","6.1.0-alpha.8","6.1.0-alpha.9","6.1.0-beta.1","6.1.0-beta.2","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.2.2","6.3.0","6.3.0-alpha.1","6.3.0-alpha.2","6.3.0-alpha.3","6.3.0-alpha.4","6.3.0-alpha.5","6.3.0-alpha.6","6.3.0-alpha.7","6.3.0-alpha.8","6.3.0-alpha.9","6.3.0-beta.1","6.3.1","6.4.0","6.4.0-alpha.1","6.4.0-alpha.2","6.4.0-alpha.3","6.4.0-alpha.4","6.4.0-alpha.5","6.4.0-alpha.6","6.4.0-alpha.7","6.4.0-alpha.8","6.4.0-beta.1","6.5.0-alpha.1","6.5.0-alpha.2","6.5.0-beta.1","7.0.0","7.0.0-alpha.1","7.0.0-alpha.10","7.0.0-alpha.11","7.0.0-alpha.12","7.0.0-alpha.13","7.0.0-alpha.14","7.0.0-alpha.15","7.0.0-alpha.16","7.0.0-alpha.17","7.0.0-alpha.18","7.0.0-alpha.19","7.0.0-alpha.2","7.0.0-alpha.20","7.0.0-alpha.21","7.0.0-alpha.22","7.0.0-alpha.23","7.0.0-alpha.24","7.0.0-alpha.25","7.0.0-alpha.26","7.0.0-alpha.27","7.0.0-alpha.28","7.0.0-alpha.29","7.0.0-alpha.3","7.0.0-alpha.30","7.0.0-alpha.31","7.0.0-alpha.4","7.0.0-alpha.5","7.0.0-alpha.6","7.0.0-alpha.7","7.0.0-alpha.8","7.0.0-alpha.9","7.0.0-beta.1","7.1.0","7.1.0-alpha.1","7.1.0-alpha.10","7.1.0-alpha.11","7.1.0-alpha.12","7.1.0-alpha.13","7.1.0-alpha.14","7.1.0-alpha.15","7.1.0-alpha.16","7.1.0-alpha.2","7.1.0-alpha.3","7.1.0-alpha.4","7.1.0-alpha.5","7.1.0-alpha.6","7.1.0-alpha.7","7.1.0-alpha.8","7.1.0-alpha.9","7.1.0-beta.1","7.2.0","7.2.0-beta.1","7.3.0","7.3.0-alpha.1","7.3.0-alpha.2","7.3.0-alpha.3","7.3.0-alpha.4","7.3.0-alpha.5","7.3.0-alpha.6","7.3.0-alpha.7","7.3.0-alpha.8","7.3.0-alpha.9","7.3.0-beta.1","7.3.1-alpha.1","7.4.0","7.4.0-alpha.1","7.4.0-alpha.2","7.4.0-alpha.3","7.4.0-alpha.4","7.4.0-alpha.5","7.4.0-alpha.6","7.4.0-alpha.7","7.4.0-beta.1","7.5.0","7.5.1","7.5.2","7.5.3","8.0.0","8.0.1","8.0.1-alpha.1","8.0.1-alpha.2","8.0.2","8.0.2-alpha.1","8.1.0","8.1.0-alpha.1","8.1.0-alpha.2","8.1.0-alpha.3","8.1.0-alpha.4","8.1.1-alpha.1","8.2.0","8.2.0-alpha.1","8.2.1","8.2.1-alpha.1","8.2.1-alpha.2","8.2.2","8.2.2-alpha.1","8.2.3","8.2.3-alpha.1","8.2.4","8.2.4-alpha.1","8.2.5","8.2.5-alpha.1","8.3.0","8.3.0-alpha.1","8.3.0-alpha.10","8.3.0-alpha.11","8.3.0-alpha.12","8.3.0-alpha.13","8.3.0-alpha.14","8.3.0-alpha.2
