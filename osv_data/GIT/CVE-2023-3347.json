The SMB2 packet signing is not enforced if an admin configured \"server signing = required\" or for SMB2 connections to Domain Controllers where SMB2 packet signing is mandatory. This flaw allows an attacker to perform attacks, such as a man-in-the-middle attack, by intercepting the network traffic and modifying the SMB2 messages between client and server, affecting the integrity of the data.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/samba-team/samba","events":[{"introduced":"fbec737d9d3d992b54f52defcba62a304efef8f7"},{"fixed":"5eceb0dfb4a6490da3e7fc58f4b527b16b934195"}]}],"versions":["ldb-2.6.2","samba-4.17.0","samba-4.17.1","samba-4.17.2","samba-4.17.3","samba-4.17.4","samba-4.17.5","samba-4.17.6","samba-4.17.7","samba-4.17.8","samba-4.17.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-3347.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:4325"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:4328"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-3347"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2222792"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2023-3347.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230731-0010/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5477"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BPCSGND7LO467AJGR5DYBGZLTCGTOBCC/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OT74M42E6C36W7PQVY3OS4ZM7DVYB64Z/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
