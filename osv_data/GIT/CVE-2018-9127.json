This only affects certificates issued to the same domain as the host, so to impersonate a host one must already have a wildcard certificate matching other hosts in the same domain. For example, b*.example.com would match some hostnames that do not begin with a 'b' character.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/randombit/botan","events":[{"introduced":"33f87a596ffa1fcbc017d9593dce0906d7d32208"},{"last_affected":"1e93b85fb5a4d628b80a9812b38b842b5c8b4363"}]}],"versions":["2.2.0","2.3.0","2.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-9127.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://botan.randombit.net/security.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
