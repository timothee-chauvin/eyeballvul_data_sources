{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53103","published":"2025-05-02T15:55:45.218Z","modified":"2025-11-20T00:41:13.385647Z","related":["SUSE-SU-2025:01983-1"],"summary":"bonding: restore bond's IFF_SLAVE flag if a non-eth dev enslave fails","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbonding: restore bond's IFF_SLAVE flag if a non-eth dev enslave fails\n\nsyzbot reported a warning[1] where the bond device itself is a slave and\nwe try to enslave a non-ethernet device as the first slave which fails\nbut then in the error path when ether_setup() restores the bond device\nit also clears all flags. In my previous fix[2] I restored the\nIFF_MASTER flag, but I didn't consider the case that the bond device\nitself might also be a slave with IFF_SLAVE set, so we need to restore\nthat flag as well. Use the bond_ether_setup helper which does the right\nthing and restores the bond's flags properly.\n\nSteps to reproduce using a nlmon dev:\n $ ip l add nlmon0 type nlmon\n $ ip l add bond1 type bond\n $ ip l add bond2 type bond\n $ ip l set bond1 master bond2\n $ ip l set dev nlmon0 master bond1\n $ ip -d l sh dev bond1\n 22: bond1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,MASTER> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master bond2 state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000\n (now bond1's IFF_SLAVE flag is gone and we'll hit a warning[3] if we\n  try to delete it)\n\n[1]
