A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in non-default configurations of Fluentd allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted JSON payloads. Fluentd setups are only affected if the environment variable `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE` is explicitly set to `object`. Please note: The option FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE was introduced in Fluentd version 1.13.2. Earlier versions of Fluentd are not affected by this vulnerability. This issue was patched in version 1.15.3. As a workaround do not use `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE=object`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/fluent/fluentd","events":[{"introduced":"f73c601ecf822a0b38f2c898db6b0da87305925d"},{"fixed":"e89092ce1132a933c12bb23fe8c9323c07ca81f5"}]}],"versions":["v1.13.2","v1.13.3","v1.14.0","v1.14.0.rc","v1.14.1","v1.14.2","v1.14.3","v1.14.4","v1.14.5","v1.14.6","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.15.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39379.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/39xxx/CVE-2022-39379.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/commit/48e5b85dab1b6d4c273090d538fc11b3f2fd8135"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/security/advisories/GHSA-fppq-mj76-fpj2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MYD5QV66OLDHES6IKVYYM3Y3YID3VVCO/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39379"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/39xxx/CVE-2022-39379.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
