  "details": "Phproject is a high performance full-featured project management system. From 1.8.0 to before 1.8.3, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Planned Hours field when creating a new project. When sending a POST request to /issues/new/, the value provided in the Planned Hours field is included in the server response without any HTML encoding or sanitization. Because of this, an attacker can craft a malicious payload such as <script>alert(1)</script> and include it in the planned_hours parameter. The server reflects the input directly in the HTML of the project creation page, causing the browser to interpret and execute it. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.3.",
