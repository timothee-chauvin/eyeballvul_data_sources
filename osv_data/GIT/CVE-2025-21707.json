is the bitmask carrying\nthe received suboptions and in several bitfields carrying per suboption\nadditional info.\n\nZeroing the bitmask before parsing is not enough to ensure a consistent\nstatus, and the MPTCP code has to additionally clear some bitfiled\ndepending on the actually parsed suboption.\n\nThe above schema is fragile, and syzbot managed to trigger a path where\na relevant bitfield
