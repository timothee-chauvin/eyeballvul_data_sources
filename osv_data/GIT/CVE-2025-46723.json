{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-46723","published":"2025-05-02T22:18:55.696Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:16:47.001337Z","aliases":["GHSA-jf2r-x3j4-23m7"],"summary":"OpenVM byte decomposition of pc in AUIPC chip can overflow","details":"OpenVM is a performant and modular zkVM framework built for customization and extensibility. In version 1.0.0, OpenVM is vulnerable to overflow through byte decomposition of pc in AUIPC chip. A typo results in the highest limb of pc being range checked to 8-bits instead of 6-bits. This results in the if statement never being triggered because the enumeration gives i=0,1,2, when instead the enumeration should give i=1,2,3, leaving pc_limbs[3] range checked to 8-bits instead of 6-bits. This leads to a vulnerability where the pc_limbs decomposition differs from the true pc, which means a malicious prover can make the destination register take a different value than the AUIPC instruction dictates, by making the decomposition overflow the BabyBear field. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6a5d93dba64b58dbbcf9ba8ebd1bcdff0397ce02"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0-alpha","v0.1.1-alpha","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc.0","v1.0.0-rc.1","v1.0.0-rc.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-46723.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cantina.xyz/code/c486d600-bed0-4fc6-aed1-de759fd29fa2/findings/21"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/46xxx/CVE-2025-46723.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/blob/0f94c8a3dfa7536c1231465d1bdee5fc607a5993/extensions/rv32im/circuit/src/auipc/core.rs#L135"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/commit/68da4b50c033da5603517064aa0a08e1bbf70a01"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/releases/tag/v1.1.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/security/advisories/GHSA-jf2r-x3j4-23m7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46723"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-131"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/46xxx/CVE-2025-46723.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
