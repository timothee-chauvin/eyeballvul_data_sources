Nokogiri `1.13.8` and `1.13.9` fail to check the return value from `xmlTextReaderExpand` in the method `Nokogiri::XML::Reader#attribute_hash`. This can lead to a null pointer exception when invalid markup is being parsed. For applications using `XML::Reader` to parse untrusted inputs, this may potentially be a vector for a denial of service attack. Users are advised to upgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.13.10`. Users may be able to search their code for calls to either `XML::Reader#attributes` or `XML::Reader#attribute_hash` to determine if they are affected.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri","events":[{"introduced":"21b4ac5862dba11c89255e2f0a8082bf63eac53a"},{"fixed":"4c80121dc309e67fa3d9f66a00516bad39b42c31"}]}],"versions":["v1.13.8","v1.13.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23476.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-qv4q-mr5r-qprj"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/commit/85410e38410f670cbbc8c5b00d07b843caee88ce"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/commit/9fe0761c47c0d4270d1a5220cfd25de080350d50"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-252","CWE-476"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
