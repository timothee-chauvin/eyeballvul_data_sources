However, some\nfunctions require the link ID to remain in the valid_links bitmap. One\nsuch example is cfg80211_cac_event(). The flow is -\n\nnl80211_remove_link()\n    cfg80211_remove_link()\n        ieee80211_del_intf_link()\n            ieee80211_vif_set_links()\n                ieee80211_vif_update_links()\n                    ieee80211_link_stop()\n                        cfg80211_cac_event()\n\ncfg80211_cac_event() requires link ID to be present but it is cleared\nalready in cfg80211_remove_link(). Ultimately, WARN_ON() is hit.\n\nTherefore, clear the link ID from the bitmap only after completing the link\nclean-up.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d74380ee99b59a2e46612c12c85e701ab213f4ea"},{"fixed":"ae07daf440d3220d0986e676317a5da66e4f9dfd"},{"fixed":"b5c32ff6a3a38c74facdd1fe34c0d709a55527fd"}]}],"versions":["v6.11","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.13-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-57898.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-57898.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ae07daf440d3220d0986e676317a5da66e4f9dfd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b5c32ff6a3a38c74facdd1fe34c0d709a55527fd"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/57xxx/CVE-2024-57898.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-57898"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/57xxx/CVE-2024-57898.json"}}
