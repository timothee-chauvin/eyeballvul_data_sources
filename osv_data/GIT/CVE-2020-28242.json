{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2020-28242","published":"2020-11-06T06:15:11.930Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:35:04.354440Z","details":"An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.x before 13.37.1, 16.x before 16.14.1, 17.x before 17.8.1, and 18.x before 18.0.1 and Certified Asterisk before 16.8-cert5. If Asterisk is challenged on an outbound INVITE and the nonce is changed in each response, Asterisk will continually send INVITEs in a loop. This causes Asterisk to consume more and more memory since the transaction will never terminate (even if the call is hung up), ultimately leading to a restart or shutdown of Asterisk. Outbound authentication must be configured on the endpoint for this to occur.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"85335355efb2d7914a1fe20ed31afcef15fd210c"},{"fixed":"57693c3d5059c69222378b798cacc4685b0985e6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-28242.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QUS54QTQCYKR36EIULYD544GXDA644HB/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2020-002.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/04/msg00001.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
