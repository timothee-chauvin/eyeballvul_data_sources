In versions 2.2.0 to 2.4.1, OpenBao's audit log experienced a regression wherein raw HTTP bodies used by few endpoints were not correctly redacted (HMAC'd). This impacts those using the ACME functionality of PKI, resulting in short-lived ACME verification challenge codes being leaked in the audit logs. Additionally, this impacts those using the OIDC issuer functionality of the identity subsystem, auth and token response codes along with claims could be leaked in the audit logs. ACME verification codes are not usable after verification or challenge expiry so are of limited long-term use. This issue has been patched in OpenBao 2.4.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openbao/openbao","events":[{"introduced":"a2bf51c891680240888f7363322ac5b2d080bb23"},{"fixed":"60a60616415dcfb0ac5ab1df63ee027718a369b6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62513.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/openbao/openbao/commit/cc2c476bac66e1d94776c2629793daec3af625f8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/openbao/openbao/security/advisories/GHSA-ghfh-fmx4-26h8"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-532"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:P/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
