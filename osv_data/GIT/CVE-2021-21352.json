In TimeTracker before version 1.19.24.5415 tokens used in password reset feature in Time Tracker are based on system time and, therefore, are predictable. This opens a window for brute force attacks to guess user tokens and, once successful, change user passwords, including that of a system administrator. This vulnerability is pathced in version 1.19.24.5415 (started to use more secure tokens) with an additional improvement in 1.19.24.5416 (limited an available window for brute force token guessing).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/anuko/timetracker","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"40f3d9345adc20e6f28eb9f59e2489aff87fecf5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-21352.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/commit/40f3d9345adc20e6f28eb9f59e2489aff87fecf5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/security/advisories/GHSA-43c9-rx4h-4gqq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.anuko.com/time-tracker/index.htm"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
