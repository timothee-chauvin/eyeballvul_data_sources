It increases the reference counter for that\nSKB to prevent unexpected freeing by another component.\nHowever, there may be a case where the index is requested, SKB is\nassigned and never consumed by PTP flows - for example due to reset during\nrunning PTP apps.\n\nAdd a check in release timestamping function to verify if the SKB\nassigned to Tx timestamp latch was freed, and release remaining SKBs.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"4901e83a94ef0a8baf27916f31daf59b0a68547f"},{"fixed":"2c84e91ef831d4fedb0b94670b3cfd1cc5f966a5"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"4901e83a94ef0a8baf27916f31daf59b0a68547f"},{"fixed":"a3f8c0a273120fd2638f03403e786c3de2382e72"}]}],"versions":["v6.15","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40175.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40175.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2c84e91ef831d4fedb0b94670b3cfd1cc5f966a5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a3f8c0a273120fd2638f03403e786c3de2382e72"}]}
