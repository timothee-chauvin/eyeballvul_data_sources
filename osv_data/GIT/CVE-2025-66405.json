Prior to 1.14.0, the gateway determined the destination baseURL by prioritizing the value in the x-portkey-custom-host request header. The proxy route then appends the client-specified path to perform an external fetch. This can be maliciously used by users for SSRF attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.14.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/portkey-ai/gateway","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"da1a1d04fe3578bdeafbbcbe035f278030f02cfb"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.10","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.12.3","v1.13.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.5.6","v1.5.7","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.7.5","v1.7.6","v1.7.7","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.8.5","v1.8.6","v1.8.7","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.10","v1.9.11","v1.9.12","v1.9.13","v1.9.15","v1.9.16","v1.9.17","v1.9.18","v1.9.19","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v1.9.6","v1.9.7","v1.9.8","v1.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66405.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway/commit/b5a7825ba5f4e6918deb32d9969899ce2229a885"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway/pull/1372"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway/security/advisories/GHSA-hhh5-2cvx-vmfp"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
