But there is one more which\napplies here.\n\nIf the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown\n(like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device link\nbetween the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers()\nwill unbind the bcm_sf2 switch driver on shutdown.\n\nSo the same treatment must be applied to all DSA switch drivers, which\nis: either use devres for both the mdiobus allocation and registration,\nor don't use devres at all.\n\nThe bcm_sf2 driver has the code structure in place for orderly mdiobus\nremoval, so just replace devm_mdiobus_alloc() with the non-devres\nvariant, and add manual free where necessary, to ensure that we don't\nlet devres free a still-registered bus.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ac3a68d56651c3dad2c12c7afce065fe15267f44"},{"fixed":"2770b795294ed312375c11ef1d0b810499c66b83"},{"fixed":"caabb5f64f5c32fceed93356bb688ef1ec6c5783"},{"fixed":"08e1a3554e99a1a5bd2835907381e2383ee85cae"},{"fixed":"08f1a20822349004bb9cc1b153ecb516e9f2889d"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.10.1","v5.10.10","v5.10.100","v5.10.11","v5.10.12","v5.10.13","v5.10.14","v5.10.15","v5.10.16","v5.10.17","v5.10.18","v5.10.19","v5.10.2","v5.10.20","v5.10.21","v5.10.22","v5.10.23","v5.10.24","v5.10.25","v5.10.26","v5.10.27","v5.10.28","v5.10.29","v5.10.3","v5.10.30","v5.10.31","v5.10.32","v5.10.33","v5.10.34","v5.10.35","v5.10.36","v5.10.37","v5.10.38","v5.10.39","v5.10.4","v5.10.40","v5.10.41","v5.10.42","v5.10.43","v5.10.44","v5.10.45","v5.10.46","v5.10.47","v5.10.48","v5.10.49","v5.10.5","v5.10.50","v5.10.51","v5.10.52","v5.10.53","v5.10.54","v5.10.55","v5.10.56","v5.10.57","v5.10.58","v5.10.59","v5.10.6","v5.10.60","v5.10.61","v5.10.62","v5.10.63","v5.10.64","v5.10.65","v5.10.66","v5.10.67","v5.10.68","v5.10.69","v5.10.7","v5.10.70","v5.10.71","v5.10.72","v5.10.73","v5.10.74","v5.10.75","v5.10.76","v5.10.77","v5.10.78","v5.10.79","v5.10.8","v5.10.80","v5.10.81","v5.10.82","v5.10.83","v5.10.84","v5.10.85","v5.10.86","v5.10.87","v5.10.88","v5.10.89","v5.10.9","v5.10.90","v5.10.91","v5.10.92","v5.10.93","v5.10.94","v5.10.95","v5.10.96","v5.10.97","v5.10.98","v5.10.99","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.3","v5.15.4","v5.15.5","v5.15.6","v5.15.7","v5.15.8","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.16.1","v5.16.2","v5.16.3","v5.16.4","v5.16.5","v5.16.6","v5.16.7","v5.16.8","v5.16.9","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.8","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-48815.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.9.0"},{"fixed":"5.10.101"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.11.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.24"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.16.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-48815.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/08e1a3554e99a1a5bd2835907381e2383ee85cae"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/08f1a20822349004bb9cc1b153ecb516e9f2889d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2770b795294ed312375c11ef1d0b810499c66b83"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/caabb5f64f5c32fceed93356bb688ef1ec6c5783"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/48xxx/CVE-2022-48815.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48815"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/48xxx/CVE-2022-48815.json"}}
