fix use-after-free bug","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: fix use-after-free bug\n\nThe bug can be triggered by sending a single amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl\nto the AMDGPU DRM driver on any ASICs with an invalid address and size.\nThe bug was reported by Joonkyo Jung <joonkyoj@yonsei.ac.kr>.\nFor example the following code:\n\nstatic void Syzkaller1(int fd)\n{\n\tstruct drm_amdgpu_gem_userptr arg;\n\tint ret;\n\n\targ.addr = 0xffffffffffff0000;\n\targ.size = 0x80000000; /*2 Gb*/\n\targ.flags = 0x7;\n\tret = drmIoctl(fd, 0xc1186451/*amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl*/, &arg);\n}\n\nDue to the address and size are not valid there is a failure in\namdgpu_hmm_register->mmu_interval_notifier_insert->__mmu_interval_notifier_insert->\ncheck_shl_overflow, but we even the amdgpu_hmm_register failure we still call\namdgpu_hmm_unregister into  amdgpu_gem_object_free which causes access to a bad address.\nThe following stack is below when the issue is reproduced when Kazan is enabled:\n\n[  +0.000014] Hardware name: ASUS System Product
