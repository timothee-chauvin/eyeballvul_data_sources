In versions 1.6.4 and below, the user management module allows a low-privileged authenticated user with permissions to modify users to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can be escalated to a full database compromise, data exfiltration, effectively bypassing all security controls. The vulnerability exists in the admin/users/save.php script, which handles updates to user profiles. The script improperly processes the groups[] parameter sent from the user edit form. This issue is fixed in version 1.6.5.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wbce/wbce_cms","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"458d4385482770a7f6e77361e64265c1413b0c99"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.0-beta.1","1.0.0-beta.2","1.0.0-beta.3","1.0.0-rc.1","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.10","1.1.11","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.1.6","1.1.8","1.1.9","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.4","1.6.0","1.6.0-beta.1","1.6.0-beta.2","1.6.0-beta.4","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.6.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65950.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/65xxx/CVE-2025-65950.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/WBCE/WBCE_CMS/commit/96046178f4c80cf16f7c224054dec7fdadddda7e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/WBCE/WBCE_CMS/releases/tag/1.6.5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/WBCE/WBCE_CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-934v-xhx9-j2f3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65950"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-89"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/65xxx/CVE-2025-65950.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H"}]}
