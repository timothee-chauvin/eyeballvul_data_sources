{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-54259","published":"2025-12-30T12:15:53.540Z","modified":"2026-01-05T21:19:49.697870Z","summary":"soundwire: bus: Fix unbalanced pm_runtime_put() causing usage count underflow","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsoundwire: bus: Fix unbalanced pm_runtime_put() causing usage count underflow\n\nThis reverts commit\n443a98e649b4 (\"soundwire: bus: use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()\")\n\nChange calls to pm_runtime_resume_and_get() back to pm_runtime_get_sync().\nThis fixes a usage count underrun caused by doing a pm_runtime_put() even\nthough pm_runtime_resume_and_get() returned an error.\n\nThe three affected functions ignore -EACCES error from trying to get\npm_runtime, and carry on, including a put at the end of the function.\nBut pm_runtime_resume_and_get() does not increment the usage count if it\nreturns an error. So in the -EACCES case you must not call\npm_runtime_put().\n\nThe documentation for pm_runtime_get_sync() says:\n \"Consider using pm_runtime_resume_and_get() ...  as this is likely to\n result in cleaner code.\"\n\nIn this case I don't think it results in cleaner code because the\npm_runtime_put() at the end of the function would have to be conditional on\nthe return value from pm_runtime_resume_and_get() at the top of the\nfunction.\n\npm_runtime_get_sync() doesn't have this problem because it always\nincrements the count, so always needs a put. The code can just flow through\nand do the pm_runtime_put() unconditionally.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"443a98e649b469b4e6a2832799853a5764ef9002"},{"fixed":"4e5e9da139c007dfc397a159093b4c4187ee67fa"},{"fixed":"203aa4374c433159f163acde2d0bd4118f23bbaf"},{"fixed":"e9537962519e88969f5f69cd0571eb4f6984403c"}]}],"versions":["v5.18","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.3.1","v6.3.2","v6.3.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54259.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.19.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.30"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.3.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54259.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/203aa4374c433159f163acde2d0bd4118f23bbaf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4e5e9da139c007dfc397a159093b4c4187ee67fa"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e9537962519e88969f5f69cd0571eb4f6984403c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54259.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54259"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54259.json"}}
