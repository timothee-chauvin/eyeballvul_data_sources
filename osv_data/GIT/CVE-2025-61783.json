{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-61783","published":"2025-10-09T20:57:20.734Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:39:59.928948Z","aliases":["GHSA-wv4w-6qv2-qqfg"],"summary":"Python Social Auth - Django has unsafe account association","details":"Python Social Auth is a social authentication/registration mechanism. In versions prior to 5.6.0, upon authentication, the user could be associated by e-mail even if the `associate_by_email` pipeline was not included. This could lead to account compromise when a third-party authentication service does not validate provided e-mail addresses or doesn't require unique e-mail addresses. Version 5.6.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, review the authentication service policy on e-mail addresses; many will not allow exploiting this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d1256b8593b3c3c9168232ce7712ee1cb27333de"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.1.0","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0","2.0.0","3.0.0","3.1.0","3.2.0","3.3.0","3.4.0","4.0.0","5.0.0","5.1.0","5.2.0","5.3.0","5.4.0","5.4.1","5.4.2","5.4.3","5.5.0","5.5.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-61783.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/commit/10c80e2ebabeccd4e9c84ad0e16e1db74148ed4c"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/issues/220"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/issues/231"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/issues/634"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/pull/803"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/security/advisories/GHSA-wv4w-6qv2-qqfg"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-303"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
