We are guaranteed\nto have at least one stable reference in slow path, so the simple atomic add\ncould be used.  The performance difference should be trivial, but the\nmisuse may be confusing and misleading.\n\nRedefined try_grab_folio() to try_grab_folio_fast(), and try_grab_page()\nto try_grab_folio(), and use them in the proper paths.  This solves both\nthe abuse and the kernel warning.\n\nThe proper naming makes their usecase more clear and should prevent from\nabusing in the future.\n\npeterx said:\n\n: The user will see the pin fails, for gpu-slow it further triggers the WARN\n: right below that failure (as in the original report):\n: \n:         folio = try_grab_folio(page, page_increm - 1,\n:                                 foll_flags);\n:         if (WARN_ON_ONCE(!folio)) { <------------------------ here\n:                 /*\n:                         * Release the 1st page ref if the\n:                         * folio is problematic, fail hard.\n:                         */\n:                 gup_put_folio(page_folio(page), 1,\n:                                 foll_flags);\n:                 ret = -EFAULT;\n:                 goto out;\n:         }\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/1719478388-31917-1-git-send-email-yangge1116@126.com/\n\n[shy828301@gmail.com: fix implicit declaration of function try_grab_folio_fast]","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"57edfcfd3419b4799353d8cbd6ce49da075cfdbd"},{"fixed":"26273f5f4cf68b29414e403837093408a9c98e1f"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"57edfcfd3419b4799353d8cbd6ce49da075cfdbd"},{"fixed":"f442fa6141379a20b48ae3efabee827a3d260787"}]}],"versions":["v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.5","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.5","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-44943.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.6.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.47"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-44943.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/26273f5f4cf68b29414e403837093408a9c98e1f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f442fa6141379a20b48ae3efabee827a3d260787"}]}
