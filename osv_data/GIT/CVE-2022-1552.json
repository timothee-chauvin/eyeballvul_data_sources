There is an issue with incomplete efforts to operate safely when a privileged user is maintaining another user's objects. The Autovacuum, REINDEX, CREATE INDEX, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW, CLUSTER, and pg_amcheck commands activated relevant protections too late or not at all during the process. This flaw allows an attacker with permission to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema to execute arbitrary SQL functions under a superuser identity.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git","events":[{"introduced":"5df0e99bea1c3e5fbffa7fbd0982da88ea149bb6"},{"fixed":"6979736b4bcdc57e4699eadcca44b699fd1afd29"}]}],"versions":["REL_10_0","REL_10_1","REL_10_10","REL_10_11","REL_10_12","REL_10_13","REL_10_14","REL_10_15","REL_10_16","REL_10_17","REL_10_18","REL_10_19","REL_10_2","REL_10_20","REL_10_3","REL_10_4","REL_10_5","REL_10_6","REL_10_7","REL_10_8","REL_10_9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-1552.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1552"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2081126"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202211-04"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221104-0005/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-143-137-1211-1116-and-1021-released-2449/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2022-1552/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
