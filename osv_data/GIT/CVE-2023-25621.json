As these translations are used across the whole product, it allows an author to change any text or dialog in the product. For example an attacker might fool someone by changing the text on a delete button to \"Info\".\nThis issue affects the i18n module of Apache Sling up to version 2.5.18. Version 2.6.2 and higher limit by default i18m dictionaries to certain paths in the repository (/libs and /apps).\n\nUsers of the module are advised to update to version 2.6.2 or higher, check the configuration for resource loading and then adjust the access permissions for the configured path accordingly.\n\n\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-i18n","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6c0bfbeda527f3646b3299427b026f844f253829"}]}],"versions":["org.apache.sling.i18n-2.5.10","org.apache.sling.i18n-2.5.12","org.apache.sling.i18n-2.5.14","org.apache.sling.i18n-2.5.16","org.apache.sling.i18n-2.5.18"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-25621.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://sling.apache.org/news.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
