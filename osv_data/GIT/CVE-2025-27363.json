The vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to an unsigned long and then adds a static value causing it to wrap around and allocate too small of a heap buffer. The code then writes up to 6 signed long integers out of bounds relative to this buffer. This may result in arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability may have been exploited in the wild.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"de8b92dd7ec634e9e2b25ef534c54a3537555c11"}]}],"versions":["BETA-5","BETA-6","BETA-7","BETA-8","DATE-050920","PRE-2-0-1","PRE-2-0-6","RELEASE-2-0","VER-2-0","VER-2-0-1","VER-2-0-2","VER-2-0-2-TEST","VER-2-0-3","VER-2-0-4","VER-2-0-5","VER-2-0-6","VER-2-0-7","VER-2-0-8","VER-2-1-0","VER-2-1-1","VER-2-1-1-RC1","VER-2-1-10","VER-2-1-2","VER-2-1-2-RC1","VER-2-1-3","VER-2-1-3-RC1","VER-2-1-3-RC2","VER-2-1-3-RC3","VER-2-1-4","VER-2-1-4-RC1","VER-2-1-4-RC2","VER-2-1-5-RC1","VER-2-1-6","VER-2-1-7","VER-2-1-8","VER-2-1-8-RC1","VER-2-1-9","VER-2-10-0","VER-2-10-1","VER-2-10-2","VER-2-10-3","VER-2-10-4","VER-2-11-0","VER-2-11-1","VER-2-12-0","VER-2-12-1","VER-2-13-0","VER-2-2-0","VER-2-2-0-RC1","VER-2-2-0-RC2","VER-2-2-0-RC3","VER-2-2-0-RC4","VER-2-2-1","VER-2-3-0","VER-2-3-0-FINAL","VER-2-3-0-RC1","VER-2-3-0-RC2","VER-2-3-1","VER-2-3-1-FINAL","VER-2-3-10","VER-2-3-11","VER-2-3-12","VER-2-3-2","VER-2-3-3","VER-2-3-4","VER-2-3-5","VER-2-3-5-REAL","VER-2-3-6","VER-2-3-7","VER-2-3-8","VER-2-3-9","VER-2-4-0","VER-2-4-1","VER-2-4-10","VER-2-4-11","VER-2-4-12","VER-2-4-12-beta","VER-2-4-2","VER-2-4-3","VER-2-4-4","VER-2-4-5","VER-2-4-6","VER-2-4-7","VER-2-4-8","VER-2-4-9","VER-2-5-0","VER-2-5-0-1","VER-2-5-1","VER-2-5-2","VER-2-5-3","VER-2-5-4","VER-2-5-5","VER-2-6","VER-2-6-1","VER-2-6-2","VER-2-6-3","VER-2-6-4","VER-2-6-5","VER-2-7","VER-2-7-1","VER-2-8","VER-2-8-1","VER-2-9","VER-2-9-1","VER-2-BETA2","VER-2-BETA3","VER-2-BETA4","freetype","freetype2","import","start"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27363.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2025-27363"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-05-01"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/13/1"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/13/11"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/13/12"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/13/2"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/13/3"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/13/8"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/14/1"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/14/2"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/14/3"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/14/4"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/06/3"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/03/msg00030.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog?field_cve=CVE-2025-27363"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
