The brute force protection submodule will prevent a brute force attack for the defined lockout period, but once expired, protection will not be re-enabled until a user or malicious actor logs in successfully. This does not affect users that do not use the built-in brute force protection submodule, nor users that use permanent account lockout. This has been patched in 0.15.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sorcery/sorcery","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0f116d223826895a73b12492f17486e5d54ab7a7"}]}],"versions":["0.11.0","show","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.10.3","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.21","v0.5.3","v0.5.30","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.10","v0.7.11","v0.7.12","v0.7.13","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.5","v0.7.6","v0.7.7","v0.7.8","v0.7.9","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.8.5","v0.8.6","v0.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-11052.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery/commit/0f116d223826895a73b12492f17486e5d54ab7a7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery/issues/231"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery/pull/235"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery/security/advisories/GHSA-jc8m-cxhj-668x"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
