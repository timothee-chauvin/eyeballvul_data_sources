{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-2178","published":"2024-06-02T11:15:07Z","modified":"2025-10-21T13:22:32.364769Z","details":"A path traversal vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui, specifically within the 'copy_to_custom_personas' endpoint in the 'lollms_personalities_infos.py' file. This vulnerability allows attackers to read arbitrary files by manipulating the 'category' and 'name' parameters during the 'Copy to custom personas folder for editing' process. By inserting '../' sequences in these parameters, attackers can traverse the directory structure and access files outside of the intended directory. Successful exploitation results in unauthorized access to sensitive information.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"aeba79f3ea934331b8ecd625a58bae6e4f7e7d3f"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9","v3.0","v3.5","v4.0","v5.0","v6.0","v6.5","v6.5.0","v6.5rc2","v6.7","v7.0","v8.0","v8.5","v9.0","v9.1","v9.2","v9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-2178.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/e585f1dd-a026-4419-8f42-5835e85fad9e"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
