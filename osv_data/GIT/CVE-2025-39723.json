{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-39723","published":"2025-09-05T17:21:31.137Z","modified":"2025-11-20T10:26:23.269276Z","summary":"netfs: Fix unbuffered write error handling","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfs: Fix unbuffered write error handling\n\nIf all the subrequests in an unbuffered write stream fail, the subrequest\ncollector doesn't update the stream->transferred value and it retains its\ninitial LONG_MAX value.  Unfortunately, if all active streams fail, then we\ntake the smallest value of { LONG_MAX, LONG_MAX, ... } as the value to set\nin wreq->transferred - which is then returned from ->write_iter().\n\nLONG_MAX was chosen as the initial value so that all the streams can be\nquickly assessed by taking the smallest value of all stream->transferred -\nbut this only works if we've set any of them.\n\nFix this by adding a flag to indicate whether the value in\nstream->transferred is valid and checking that when we integrate the\nvalues.  stream->transferred can then be initialised to zero.\n\nThis was found by running the generic/750 xfstest against cifs with\ncache=none.  It splices data to the target file.  Once (if) it has used up\nall the available scratch space, the writes start failing with ENOSPC.\nThis causes ->write_iter() to fail.  However, it was returning\nwreq->transferred, i.e. LONG_MAX, rather than an error (because it thought\nthe amount transferred was non-zero) and iter_file_splice_write() would\nthen try to clean up that amount of pipe bufferage - leading to an oops\nwhen it overran.  The kernel log showed:\n\n    CIFS: VFS: Send error in write = -28\n\nfollowed by:\n\n    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008\n\nwith:\n\n    RIP: 0010:iter_file_splice_write+0x3a4/0x520\n    do_splice+0x197/0x4e0\n\nor:\n\n    RIP: 0010:pipe_buf_release (include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h:282)\n    iter_file_splice_write (fs/splice.c:755)\n\nAlso put a warning check into splice to announce if ->write_iter() returned\nthat it had written more than it was asked to.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"288ace2f57c9d06dd2e42bd80d03747d879a4068"},{"fixed":"f08c80af3c9a9849cd178b4843b7c01d103506a1"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"288ace2f57c9d06dd2e42bd80d03747d879a4068"},{"fixed":"387164a2b97e1f5404c6d0049a7409bac7d2bc5b"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"288ace2f57c9d06dd2e42bd80d03747d879a4068"},{"fixed":"a3de58b12ce074ec05b8741fa28d62ccb1070468"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.16.1","v6.16.2","v6.16.3","v6.17-rc1","v6.9","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39723.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.10.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.44"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39723.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/387164a2b97e1f5404c6d0049a7409bac7d2bc5b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a3de58b12ce074ec05b8741fa28d62ccb1070468"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f08c80af3c9a9849cd178b4843b7c01d103506a1"}]}
