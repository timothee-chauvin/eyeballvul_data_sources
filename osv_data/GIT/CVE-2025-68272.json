{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68272","published":"2026-01-01T18:08:06.947Z","modified":"2026-01-01T19:41:25.736244Z","aliases":["GHSA-7rqc-ff8m-7j23"],"summary":"Signal K Server Vulnerable to Denial of Service via Unrestricted Access Request Flooding","details":"Signal K Server is a server application that runs on a central hub in a boat. A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in versions prior to 2.19.0 allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash the SignalK Server by flooding the access request endpoint (`/signalk/v1/access/requests`). This causes a \"JavaScript heap out of memory\" error due to unbounded in-memory storage of request objects. Version 2.19.0 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/signalk/signalk-server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3037c517bb8de70c4b74b61192c57d6176731571"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.19.0"}]}}],"versions":["0.1.1","0.1.10","0.1.11","0.1.12","0.1.13","0.1.18","0.1.19","0.1.2","0.1.3","0.1.4","0.1.5","0.1.6","0.1.7","0.1.8","0.1.9","latest","v0.1.24","v0.1.26","v0.1.27","v0.1.28","v0.1.29","v0.1.30","v0.1.33","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-0","v1.0.0-1","v1.0.0-2","v1.0.0-3","v1.0.0-4","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.17.0","v1.18.0","v1.19.0","v1.19.0-beta.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.20.0","v1.21.0","v1.22.0","v1.23.0","v1.24.0","v1.25.0","v1.26.0","v1.27.0","v1.27.1","v1.28.0","v1.29.0","v1.3.0","v1.30.0","v1.31.0","v1.32.0","v1.32.0-beta.1","v1.32.0-beta.2","v1.32.0-beta.3","v1.33.0","v1.33.0-beta.1","v1.34.0","v1.35.0","v1.35.1","v1.35.2","v1.36.0","v1.36.0-beta.1","v1.36.0-beta.2","v1.36.0-beta.3","v1.37.0","v1.37.0-beta.1","v1.37.0-beta.3","v1.37.1","v1.37.2","v1.37.3","v1.37.4","v1.37.5","v1.37.6","v1.38.0","v1.38.1","v1.39.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.40.0","v1.41.0","v1.41.0-beta.1","v1.41.0-beta.2","v1.41.0-beta.3","v1.41.0-beta.4","v1.41.1","v1.41.2","v1.41.3","v1.42.0","v1.43.0","v1.44.0","v1.45.0","v1.46.0","v1.46.1","v1.46.2","v1.46.3","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-beta.10","v2.0.0-beta.11","v2.0.0-beta.12","v2.0.0-beta.2","v2.0.0-beta.3","v2.0.0-beta.4","v2.0.0-beta.5","v2.0.0-beta.6","v2.0.0-beta.7","v2.0.0-beta.8","v2.0.0-beta.9","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.12.0","v2.13.0","v2.13.0-beta.0","v2.13.0-beta.1","v2.13.0-beta.2","v2.13.0-beta.3","v2.13.1","v2.13.2","v2.13.3","v2.13.4","v2.13.5","v2.14.0","v2.14.0-beta.0","v2.14.0-beta.1","v2.14.1","v2.14.2","v2.14.3","v2.14.4","v2.15.0","v2.15.0-beta.5","v2.15.0-beta.6","v2.15.1","v2.15.2","v2.15.3","v2.16.0","v2.17.0","v2.17.1","v2.17.2","v2.18.0","v2.19.0-beta.1","v2.19.0-beta.2","v2.19.0-beta.3","v2.19.0-beta.4","v2.19.0-beta.5","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.7.2","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.8.3","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68272.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68272.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server/releases/tag/v2.19.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server/security/advisories/GHSA-7rqc-ff8m-7j23"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68272"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-400","CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68272.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
