In Redit 7.0 prior to 7.0.12, extracting key names from a command and a list of arguments may, in some cases, trigger a heap overflow and result in reading random heap memory, heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. Several scenarios that may lead to authenticated users executing a specially crafted `COMMAND GETKEYS` or `COMMAND GETKEYSANDFLAGS`and authenticated users who were set with ACL rules that match key names, executing a specially crafted command that refers to a variadic list of key names. The vulnerability is patched in Redis 7.0.12.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/redis/redis","events":[{"introduced":"d375595d5e3ae2e5c29e6c00a2dc3d60578fd9fc"},{"fixed":"8e73f9d34821a937165884f13a2981883f44a074"}]}],"versions":["7.0.0","7.0.1","7.0.10","7.0.11","7.0.2","7.0.3","7.0.4","7.0.5","7.0.6","7.0.7","7.0.8","7.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-36824.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-4cfx-h9gq-xpx3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230814-0009/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.0.12"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MIF5MAGYARYUMRFK7PQI7HYXMK2HZE5T/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TDNNH2ONMVNBQ6LUIAOAGDNFPKXNST5K/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-122","CWE-131"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
