dev_parse_header_protocol when skb->dev is null\n\nFixes a NULL pointer derefence bug triggered from tap driver.\nWhen tap_get_user calls virtio_net_hdr_to_skb the skb->dev is null\n(in tap.c skb->dev is set after the call to virtio_net_hdr_to_skb)\nvirtio_net_hdr_to_skb calls dev_parse_header_protocol which\nneeds skb->dev field to be valid.\n\nThe line that trigers the bug is in dev_parse_header_protocol\n(dev is at offset 0x10 from skb and is stored in RAX register)\n  if (!dev->header_ops || !dev->header_ops->parse_protocol)\n  22e1:   mov    0x10(%rbx),%rax\n  22e5:\t  mov    0x230(%rax),%rax\n\nSetting skb->dev before the call in tap.c fixes the issue.\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000230\nRIP:
