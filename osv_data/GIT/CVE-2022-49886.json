This includes\neverything from kernel stacks to kernel text.  Handling\nexceptions on arbitrary accesses to kernel memory is essentially\nimpossible because they can happen in horribly nasty places like\nkernel entry/exit.  But, TDX hardware can theoretically _deliver_\na virtualization exception (#VE) on any access to private memory.\n\nBut, it's not as bad as it sounds.  TDX can be configured to never\ndeliver these exceptions on private memory with a \"TD attribute\"\ncalled ATTR_SEPT_VE_DISABLE.  The guest has no way to *set* this\nattribute, but it can check it.\n\nEnsure ATTR_SEPT_VE_DISABLE is set in early boot.  panic() if it\nis unset.  There is no sane way for Linux to run with this\nattribute clear so a panic() is appropriate.\n\nThere's small window during boot before the check where kernel\nhas an early #VE handler. But the handler is only for port I/O\nand will also panic() as soon as it sees any other #VE, such as\na one generated by a private memory access.\n\n[ dhansen: Rewrite changelog and rebase on new tdx_parse_tdinfo().\n\t   Add Kirill's tested-by because I made changes since\n\t   he wrote this. ]","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9a22bf6debbf5169f750af53c7f86eb4e3cd6712"},{"fixed":"895c168c8f78079f21ad50fead7593ffa352f795"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9a22bf6debbf5169f750af53c7f86eb4e3cd6712"},{"fixed":"373e715e31bf4e0f129befe87613a278fac228d3"}]}],"versions":["v5.18","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.0.6","v6.0.7","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49886.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.19.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49886.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/373e715e31bf4e0f129befe87613a278fac228d3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/895c168c8f78079f21ad50fead7593ffa352f795"}]}
