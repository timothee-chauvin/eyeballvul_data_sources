In affected versions successful login attempts are recorded with the raw tokens stored in the log table. If a malicious person somehow views the data in the log table they can obtain a raw token which can then be used to send a request with that user's authority. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0-beta.8. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable logging for successful login attempts by the configuration files.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"434e5a0e550d24199dc4f04033a872e8d3d847d7"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0-beta","v1.0.0-beta.2","v1.0.0-beta.3","v1.0.0-beta.4","v1.0.0-beta.5","v1.0.0-beta.6","v1.0.0-beta.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-48708.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://codeigniter4.github.io/shield/getting_started/authenticators/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/48xxx/CVE-2023-48708.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/commit/7e84c3fb3411294f70890819bfe51781bb9dc8e4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/security/advisories/GHSA-j72f-h752-mx4w"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48708"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-532"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/48xxx/CVE-2023-48708.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
