The affected element is the function extractBaseCommand of the file src/command-manager.ts of the component Absolute Path Handler. Such manipulation leads to os command injection. The attack may be performed from remote. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor explains: \"The usual use case is that AI is asked to do something, picks commands itself, and typically uses simple command names without absolute paths. It's curious why a user would ask the model to bypass restrictions this way. (...) This could potentially be a problem, but we are yet to hear reports of this being an issue in actual workflows. We'll leave this issue open for situations where people may report this as a problem for the long term.\"","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/desktopcommandermcp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"7f7c0e4e2d0be4309b50561ced118ec7f2093dea"}]}],"versions":["v.0.1.28","v.0.1.31","v.0.1.33","v0.1.22","v0.1.23","v0.1.25","v0.1.26","v0.1.27","v0.1.29","v0.1.35","v0.1.37","v0.1.39","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.13","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-11490.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP/issues/218"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP/issues/218#issue-3343855120"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.327609"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://vuldb.com/?id.327609"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://vuldb.com/?submit.668005"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP/issues/218#issuecomment-3214135034"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
