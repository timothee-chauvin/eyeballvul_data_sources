{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-41177","published":"2021-10-25T22:15:07Z","modified":"2025-10-21T06:35:23.829106Z","related":["GHSA-fj39-4qx4-m3f2","openSUSE-SU-2021:1602-1"],"details":"Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to versions 20.0.13, 21.0.5, and 22.2.0, Nextcloud Server did not implement a database backend for rate-limiting purposes. Any component of Nextcloud using rate-limits (as as `AnonRateThrottle` or `UserRateThrottle`) was thus not rate limited on instances not having a memory cache backend configured. In the case of a default installation, this would notably include the rate-limits on the two factor codes. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server be upgraded to 20.0.13, 21.0.5, or 22.2.0. As a workaround, enable a memory cache backend in `config.php`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"43a0a9a3213588d5f6fc88a0e52df6b8a0b9b9ec"}]}],"versions":["20.0.12rc1","list","v1.0.0beta1","v1.0RC1","v1.1","v11.0.0","v11.0RC2","v12.0.0beta1","v12.0.0beta2","v12.0.0beta3","v12.0.0beta4","v13.0.0RC1","v13.0.0beta1","v13.0.0beta2","v13.0.0beta3","v13.0.0beta4","v14.0.0RC1","v14.0.0RC2","v14.0.0beta1","v14.0.0beta2","v14.0.0beta3","v14.0.0beta4","v15.0.0RC1","v15.0.0beta1","v15.0.0beta2","v16.0.0RC1","v16.0.0alpha1","v16.0.0beta1","v16.0.0beta2","v16.0.0beta3","v17.0.0beta1","v17.0.0beta2","v17.0.0beta3","v17.0.0beta4","v18.0.0RC1","v18.0.0beta1","v18.0.0beta2","v18.0.0beta3","v18.0.0beta4","v19.0.0RC1","v19.0.0RC2","v19.0.0beta1","v19.0.0beta2","v19.0.0beta3","v19.0.0beta4","v19.0.0beta5","v19.0.0beta6","v19.0.0beta7","v2.0beta3","v20.0.0","v20.0.0RC1","v20.0.0RC2","v20.0.0beta1","v20.0.0beta2","v20.0.0beta3","v20.0.0beta4","v20.0.1","v20.0.10","v20.0.10RC1","v20.0.11","v20.0.11rc1","v20.0.12","v20.0.13rc1","v20.0.1RC1","v20.0.2","v20.0.2RC1","v20.0.2RC2","v20.0.3","v20.0.3RC2","v20.0.4","v20.0.5","v20.0.5RC1","v20.0.5RC2","v20.0.6","v20.0.6RC1","v20.0.7","v20.0.7RC1","v20.0.8","v20.0.8RC1","v20.0.9","v20.0.9RC1","v3.0","v3.0RC1","v3.0alpha1","v4.0.0","v4.0.0RC","v4.0.0RC2","v4.0.0beta","v4.0.1","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.5","v4.0.6","v4.5.0","v4.5.0RC1","v4.5.0RC2","v4.5.0RC3","v4.5.0beta1","v4.5.0beta2","v4.5.0beta3","v4.5.0beta4","v5.0.0","v5.0.0RC1","v5.0.0RC2","v5.0.0RC3","v5.0.0alpha1","v5.0.0beta1","v5.0.0beta2","v6.0.0RC1","v6.0.0RC2","v6.0.0alpha2","v6.0.0beta2","v6.0.0beta3","v6.0.0beta4","v6.0.0beta5","v7.0.0alpha2","v7.0.0beta1","v8.0.0","v8.0.0RC1","v8.0.0RC2","v8.0.0alpha1","v8.0.0alpha2","v8.0.0beta1","v8.0.0beta2","v8.1.0alpha1","v8.1.0alpha2","v8.1.0beta1","v8.1.0beta2","v8.1RC2","v8.2RC1","v8.2beta1","v9.0.0beta2","v9.0.1beta2","v9.0beta1","v9.1.0beta1","v9.1.0beta2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-41177.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-fj39-4qx4-m3f2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/28728"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1265709"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-17"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
