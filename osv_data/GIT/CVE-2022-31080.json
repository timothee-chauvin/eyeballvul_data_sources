{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-31080","published":"2022-07-11T20:55:09Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:31:52.286933Z","aliases":["GHSA-6wvc-6pww-qr4r","GO-2022-0512"],"summary":"KubeEdge Websocket Client in package Viaduct: DoS from large response message","details":"KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, a large response received by the viaduct WSClient can cause a DoS from memory exhaustion. The entire body of the response is being read into memory which could allow an attacker to send a request that returns a response with a large body. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the process which invokes a WSClient will be in a denial of service. The software is affected If users who are authenticated to the edge side connect to `cloudhub` from the edge side through WebSocket protocol. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There are currently no known workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"24b146e19e8b8d9171851673ff60162711ac71c9"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge","events":[{"introduced":"3803951602f938d9d90d74957eb0fbc238142101"},{"fixed":"27a6957ee7685884a7d9b3d87c13f61625cb3bc9"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ecca82fd5d0b0891dbd562f4d4349443d958b9df"}]}],"versions":["v0.1","v0.2","v0.2.1","v0.3.0-beta.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0-beta.0","v1.10.0","v1.10.0-beta.0","v1.10.1","v1.11.0","v1.11.0-alpha.0","v1.11.0-beta.0","v1.2.0-beta.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-alpha.0","v1.3.0-beta.0","v1.4.0-alpha.0","v1.4.0-beta.0","v1.5.0-beta.0","v1.6.0-beta.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-beta.0","v1.8.0-beta.0","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-beta.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31080.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/advisories/GHSA-6wvc-6pww-qr4r"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
