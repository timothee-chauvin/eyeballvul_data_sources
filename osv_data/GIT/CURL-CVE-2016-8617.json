If this happens, an undersized output buffer is allocated, but the full\nresult is written, thus causing the memory behind the output buffer to be\noverwritten.\n\nIf a username is set directly via `CURLOPT_USERNAME` (or curl's `-u, --user`\noption), this vulnerability can be triggered. The name has to be at least\n512MB big in a 32-bit system.\n\nSystems with 64-bit versions of the `size_t` type are not affected by this\nissue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"7.8.1"},{"fixed":"7.51.0"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git","events":[{"introduced":"00b00c693127d9e3a4eedce4c8cdf6e87087192d"},{"fixed":"efd24d57426bd77c9b5860e6b297904703750412"}]}],"versions":["7.50.3","7.50.2","7.50.1","7.50.0","7.49.1","7.49.0","7.48.0","7.47.1","7.47.0","7.46.0","7.45.0","7.44.0","7.43.0","7.42.1","7.42.0","7.41.0","7.40.0","7.39.0","7.38.0","7.37.1","7.37.0","7.36.0","7.35.0","7.34.0","7.33.0","7.32.0","7.31.0","7.30.0","7.29.0","7.28.1","7.28.0","7.27.0","7.26.0","7.25.0","7.24.0","7.23.1","7.23.0","7.22.0","7.21.7","7.21.6","7.21.5","7.21.4","7.21.3","7.21.2","7.21.1","7.21.0","7.20.1","7.20.0","7.19.7","7.19.6","7.19.5","7.19.4","7.19.3","7.19.2","7.19.1","7.19.0","7.18.2","7.18.1","7.18.0","7.17.1","7.17.0","7.16.4","7.16.3","7.16.2","7.16.1","7.16.0","7.15.5","7.15.4","7.15.3","7.15.2","7.15.1","7.15.0","7.14.1","7.14.0","7.13.2","7.13.1","7.13.0","7.12.3","7.12.2","7.12.1","7.12.0","7.11.2","7.11.1","7.11.0","7.10.8","7.10.7","7.10.6","7.10.5","7.10.4","7.10.3","7.10.2","7.10.1","7.10","7.9.8","7.9.7","7.9.6","7.9.5","7.9.4","7.9.3","7.9.2","7.9.1","7.9","7.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://curl.se/docs/CURL-CVE-2016-8617.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["330189580163966104573813564222353944049","251539769233120043131544711578422921980","110228242315381419112297075161928694033"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CURL-CVE-2016-8617-36b10dd2","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git/commit/efd24d57426bd77c9b5860e6b297904703750412","target":{"file":"lib/base64.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"339377937843865329842231627374085505111","length":1573},"id":"CURL-CVE-2016-8617-acca1aa4","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git/commit/efd24d57426bd77c9b5860e6b297904703750412","target":{"file":"lib/base64.c","function":"base64_encode"}}]}}],"database_specific":{"CWE":{"desc":"Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size","id":"CWE-131"},"URL":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2016-8617.json","affects":"both","last_affected":"7.50.3","package":"curl","severity":"Medium","www":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2016-8617.html"},"credits":[{"name":"Cure53","type":"FINDER"},{"name":"Daniel Stenberg","type":"REMEDIATION_DEVELOPER"}]}
