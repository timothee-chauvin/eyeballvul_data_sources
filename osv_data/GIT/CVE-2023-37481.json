The Fides webserver is vulnerable to a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to upload zip files containing malicious SVG bombs (similar to a billion laughs attack), causing resource exhaustion in Admin UI browser tabs and creating a persistent denial of service of the 'new connector' page (`datastore-connection/new`). This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.15.1`. Exploitation is limited to users with elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` scope, which includes root users and users with the owner role. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There is no known workaround to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ethyca/fides","events":[{"introduced":"b1819932796d12f896eb19d429e0d6e5410955fa"},{"fixed":"8d539d2e847527aa090a84b60115e378ad0f13ed"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-37481.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/8beaace082b325e693dc7682029a3cb7e6c2b69d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-3rw2-wfc8-wmj5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
