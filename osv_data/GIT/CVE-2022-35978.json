In **single player**, a mod can set a global setting that controls the Lua script loaded to display the main menu. The script is then loaded as soon as the game session is exited. The Lua environment the menu runs in is not sandboxed and can directly interfere with the user's system. There are currently no known workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"da71e86633d0b27cd02d7aac9fdac625d141ca13"}]}],"versions":["0.2.20110731_3","0.2.20110922","0.2.20110922_1","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.dev-20111021","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.10","0.4.11","0.4.13","0.4.14","0.4.15","0.4.16","0.4.2-rc1","0.4.3","0.4.4","0.4.5","0.4.6","0.4.7","0.4.7-MSVC","0.4.8","0.4.9","0.4.dev-20111201-0","0.4.dev-20111202-1","0.4.dev-20111203-1","0.4.dev-20111203-2","0.4.dev-20111203-3","0.4.dev-20111204-1","0.4.dev-20111209-1","0.4.dev-20120106-1","0.4.dev-20120122-1","0.4.dev-20120318","0.4.dev-20120320","0.4.dev-20120326","0.4.dev-20120408","0.4.dev-20120603","0.4.dev-20120606","5.0.0","5.1.0","5.2.0","5.3.0","5.4.0","5.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35978.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["176577393657784838937337067422752848185","231714822765862313606177424618259089224","208500891340563543419976022653506180140","59163179051876664140845777577596136176","94135328803724260969052602366128234721","91644312944984581510822448612090138213","118061705799679389374600719403203971586","94108287914412563219834242331285351939","297295444819886776360825326696600298970","279175145072630370503033368460552013865"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2022-35978-57bf2a73","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/commit/da71e86633d0b27cd02d7aac9fdac625d141ca13","target":{"file":"src/script/lua_api/l_settings.cpp"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"184387379296907250569518064336703200502","length":608},"id":"CVE-2022-35978-b4ad9459","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/commit/da71e86633d0b27cd02d7aac9fdac625d141ca13","target":{"file":"src/script/lua_api/l_settings.cpp","function":"checkSettingSecurity"}}]}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/minetest/minetest","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"53dd648c96b899b706f30de656896713d7e8ff08"}]}],"versions":["0.2.20110731_3","0.2.20110922","0.2.20110922_1","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.dev-20111021","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.10","0.4.11","0.4.13","0.4.14","0.4.15","0.4.16","0.4.2-rc1","0.4.3","0.4.4","0.4.5","0.4.6","0.4.7","0.4.7-MSVC","0.4.8","0.4.9","0.4.dev-20111201-0","0.4.dev-20111202-1","0.4.dev-20111203-1","0.4.dev-20111203-2","0.4.dev-20111203-3","0.4.dev-20111204-1","0.4.dev-20111209-1","0.4.dev-20120106-1","0.4.dev-20120122-1","0.4.dev-20120318","0.4.dev-20120320","0.4.dev-20120326","0.4.dev-20120408","0.4.dev-20120603","0.4.dev-20120606","5.0.0","5.1.0","5.2.0","5.3.0","5.4.0","5.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35978.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://dev.minetest.net/Changelog#5.5.0_.E2.86.92_5.6.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/35xxx/CVE-2022-35978.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/minetest/minetest/commit/da71e86633d0b27cd02d7aac9fdac625d141ca13"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/minetest/minetest/security/advisories/GHSA-663q-pcjw-27cc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35978"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-693"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/35xxx/CVE-2022-35978.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L"}]}
