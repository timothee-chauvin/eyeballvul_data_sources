In versions priot to 1.5.2 trying to read malformed HAMT sharded directories can cause panics and virtual memory leaks.\nIf you are reading untrusted user input, an attacker can then trigger a panic. This is caused by bogus fanout parameter in the HAMT directory nodes. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"59050ea8bc458ae55246ae09243e6e165923e076"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-23631.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode/commit/59050ea8bc458ae55246ae09243e6e165923e076"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode/commit/91b3d39d33ef0cd2aff2c95d50b2329350944b68"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode/commit/a4ed723727e0bdc2277158337c2fc0d82802d122"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode/security/advisories/GHSA-4gj3-6r43-3wfc"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
