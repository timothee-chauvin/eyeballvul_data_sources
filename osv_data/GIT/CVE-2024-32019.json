{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-32019","published":"2024-04-12T20:33:18.080Z","modified":"2025-12-05T04:19:20.229814Z","aliases":["GHSA-pmhq-4cxq-wj93"],"related":["UBUNTU-CVE-2024-32019"],"summary":"ndsudo: local privilege escalation via untrusted search path","details":"Netdata is an open source observability tool. In affected versions the `ndsudo` tool shipped with affected versions of the Netdata Agent allows an attacker to run arbitrary programs with root permissions. The `ndsudo` tool is packaged as a `root`-owned executable with the SUID bit set. It only runs a restricted set of external commands, but its search paths are supplied by the `PATH` environment variable. This allows an attacker to control where `ndsudo` looks for these commands, which may be a path the attacker has write access to. This may lead to local privilege escalation. This vulnerability has been addressed in versions 1.45.3 and 1.45.2-169. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/netdata/netdata","events":[{"introduced":"f70556d7cb121178de9c01cf11b97c1956ad1221"},{"fixed":"59ee49c63212596c79cf7cdaf9b7e0167f1c1739"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.45.0"},{"fixed":"1.45.3"}]}}],"versions":["v1.45.0","v1.45.1","v1.45.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-32019.json","unresolved_ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"1.44.0-60"},{"fixed":"1.45.0-169"}]}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/32xxx/CVE-2024-32019.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/netdata/netdata/pull/17377"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/netdata/netdata/security/advisories/GHSA-pmhq-4cxq-wj93"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32019"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-426"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/32xxx/CVE-2024-32019.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
