When new URL() throws an error, it can be manipulated to misinterpret the hostname. An attacker could exploit this weakness to redirect traffic to a malicious site, potentially leading to information disclosure, phishing attacks, or other security breaches.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"65858205e59f1e23c9bf173348a7a7cbb8ac47f5"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.6","v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.13.3","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.14.2","v1.14.3","v1.14.4","v1.14.5","v1.14.6","v1.14.7","v1.14.8","v1.14.9","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.15.2","v1.15.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.10","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.5.6","v1.5.7","v1.5.8","v1.5.9","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.9.0","v1.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-26159.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-FOLLOWREDIRECTS-6141137"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241108-0002/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/issues/235"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/pull/236"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZZ425BFKNBQ6AK7I5SAM56TWON5OF2XM/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
