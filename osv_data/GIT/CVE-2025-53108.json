Prior to 0.20.1, HomeBox contains a missing authorization check in the API endpoints responsible for updating and deleting inventory item attachments. This flaw allows authenticated users to perform unauthorized actions on inventory item attachments that they do not own. This issue could lead to unauthorized data manipulation or loss of critical inventory data. This issue has been patched in version 0.20.1. There are no workarounds, users must upgrade.",
