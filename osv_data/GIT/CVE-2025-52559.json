From versions 2.0.0-rc1 to before 10.4 in Zulip Server, the /digest/ URL of a server shows a preview of what the email weekly digest would contain. This URL, though not the digest itself, contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in both topic names and channel names. This issue has been fixed in Zulip Server 10.4. A workaround for this issue involves denying access to /digest/.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip","events":[{"introduced":"edb50cbf2ccbaebfa8ffb54a096e4d319435b06e"},{"fixed":"ad6867b6cc1e5eac5a005f51cadf870317f5a948"}]}],"versions":["10.0","10.0-beta1","10.0-beta2","10.0-dev","10.1","10.2","10.3","2.0.0","2.0.0-rc1","2.1-dev","2.1.0","2.1.0-rc1","2.2-dev","3.0","3.0-dev","3.0-rc1","3.0-rc2","4.0","4.0-dev","5.0","5.0-dev","6.0","6.0-dev","7.0","7.0-beta3","7.0-dev","8.0","8.0-beta1","8.0-beta2","8.0-dev","9.0","9.0-beta1","9.0-dev","shared-0.0.1","shared-0.0.10","shared-0.0.11","shared-0.0.12","shared-0.0.13","shared-0.0.14","shared-0.0.15","shared-0.0.16","shared-0.0.17","shared-0.0.18","shared-0.0.2","shared-0.0.3","shared-0.0.4","shared-0.0.5","shared-0.0.6","shared-0.0.7","shared-0.0.8","shared-0.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52559.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/175ec1f365b0db982d6eac9019701cbf6e8bc2f2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/1a8429e338ff53bdcc4b42e7e71b6fffdd84fcd1"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/6608c8777254e73a4b540e5e1c4af92e680a55fc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-vgf2-vw4r-m663"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
