It\n   requires acquiring ctlr->bus_lock_mutex.\n\nStep one is irrelevant because cadence-qspi is not queued. Step two\nhowever has two implications:\n - A deadlock occurs, because ->runtime_resume() is called in a context\n   where the lock is already taken (in the ->exec_op() callback, where\n   the usage count is incremented).\n - It would disallow all operations once the device is auto-suspended.\n\nHere is a brief call tree highlighting the mutex deadlock:\n\nspi_mem_exec_op()\n        ...\n        spi_mem_access_start()\n                mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)\n\n        cqspi_exec_mem_op()\n                pm_runtime_resume_and_get()\n                        cqspi_resume()\n                                spi_controller_resume()\n                                        mutex_lock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)\n                ...\n\n        spi_mem_access_end()\n                mutex_unlock(&ctlr->bus_lock_mutex)\n        ...","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0578a6dbfe7514db7134501cf93acc21cf13e479"},{"fixed":"041562ebc4759c9932b59a06527f8753b86da365"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0578a6dbfe7514db7134501cf93acc21cf13e479"},{"fixed":"959043afe53ae80633e810416cee6076da6e91c6"}]}],"versions":["v6.6","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.7.1","v6.7.2","v6.7.3","v6.7.4","v6.7.5","v6.7.6","v6.7.7","v6.7.8","v6.8-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-26806.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.7.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-26806.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/041562ebc4759c9932b59a06527f8753b86da365"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/959043afe53ae80633e810416cee6076da6e91c6"}]}
