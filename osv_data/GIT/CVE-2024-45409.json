Ruby-SAML in <= 12.2 and 1.13.0 <= 1.16.0 does not properly verify the signature of the SAML Response. An unauthenticated attacker with access to any signed saml document (by the IdP) can thus forge a SAML Response/Assertion with arbitrary contents. This would allow the attacker to log in as arbitrary user within the vulnerable system. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.17.0 and 1.12.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/onelogin/ruby-saml","events":[{"introduced":"5da850c36bbf678674f9321032df428139d7e434"},{"fixed":"1bc447f297b769d1a9abeb619ce074bd9c410a72"}]}],"versions":["v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.16.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45409.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/saml-toolkits/ruby-saml","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1ec5392bc506fe43a02dbb66b68741051c5ffeae"},{"fixed":"4865d030cae9705ee5cdb12415c654c634093ae7"}]}],"versions":["0.7.3","0.8.0","0.8.1","1.3.1","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.5.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.6.0","v0.7.1","v0.9","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.8.0","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45409.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f6896a3182abc8fa52bb9798c7be35adc0458657"}]}],"versions":["11-10-0cfa69752d8-0d9531c80-ee","11-10-0cfa69752d8-74ffd66ae-ee","11-10-119f9509d50-6d7537235-ee","v1.0.2","v1.1.0pre","v1.2.0","v1.2.0pre","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v10.1.0.pre","v10.2.0.pre","v10.3.0.pre","v10.4.0.pre","v10.5.0.pre","v10.6.0.pre","v10.7.0.pre","v10.8.0.pre","v10.9.0.pre","v11.0.0.pre","v11.1.0.pre","v11.2.0.pre","v11.3.0.pre","v16.11.0-ee","v16.11.0-rc42-ee","v16.11.1-ee","v16.11.2-ee","v16.11.3-ee","v16.11.3-rc42-ee","v16.11.4-ee","v16.11.5-ee","v16.11.6-ee","v16.11.7-ee","v16.11.8-ee","v16.11.9-ee","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.0pre","v2.3.0","v2.3.0pre","v2.3.1","v2.4.0","v2.4.0pre","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.6.0pre","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.6.3","v2.7.0","v2.7.0pre","v2.8.0","v2.8.0pre","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.1.0","v4.0.0","v4.0.0rc1","v4.0.0rc2","v5.0.0","v5.1.0","v5.2.0","v5.3.0","v6.0.0","v6.0.0-ee","v6.0.0-ee.beta","v6.0.0-ee.rc1","v6.1.0-ee","v6.2.0","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.3.0","v6.3.0-ee","v6.3.1-ee","v6.4.0","v6.4.0-ee","v6.4.0.pre1","v6.4.0.pre2","v6.4.0.pre3","v6.4.1","v6.4.2","v6.4.3","v6.5.0","v6.5.0-ee","v6.5.0.rc1","v6.5.1","v6.6.0","v6.6.0-ee","v6.6.0.pre1","v6.6.0.rc1","v6.6.1","v6.6.2","v6.7.0-ee","v6.7.0.rc1","v6.7.0.rc1-ee","v6.7.1","v6.7.2","v6.8.0","v6.8.0-ee","v6.8.0.rc1","v6.8.1","v6.9.0.rc1","v7.0.0","v7.0.0-ee","v7.0.0.rc1","v7.1.0","v7.1.0-ee","v7.1.0.rc1","v7.1.0.rc1-ee","v7.2.0.rc1","v7.2.0.rc1-ee","v7.2.0.rc2","v7.2.0.rc2-ee","v7.2.0.rc3","v7.2.0.rc3-ee","v7.2.0.rc4","v7.2.0.rc4-ee","v7.2.0.rc5","v7.2.0.rc5-ee","v7.3.0","v7.3.0-ee","v7.3.0.rc1","v7.3.0.rc1-ee","v7.4.0","v7.4.0-ee","v7.4.1","v7.4.1-ee","v7.4.2","v7.4.2-ee","v7.4.3","v7.4.3-ee","v7.4.4-ee","v8.10.0.pre","v8.11.0","v8.11.0-ee","v8.11.0-rc1","v8.11.0-rc1-ee","v8.11.0-rc2","v8.11.0-rc2-ee","v8.11.0-rc3","v8.11.0-rc3-ee","v8.11.0-rc4","v8.11.0-rc4-ee","v8.11.0-rc5","v8.11.0-rc5-ee","v8.11.0-rc6","v8.11.0-rc6-ee","v8.11.0-rc7","v8.11.0-rc7-ee","v8.11.0.pre","v8.11.1","v8.12.0","v8.12.0-ee","v8.12.0-rc1","v8.12.0-rc1-ee","v8.12.0-rc2","v8.12.0-rc2-ee","v8.12.0-rc3","v8.12.0-rc3-ee","v8.12.0-rc4","v8.12.0-rc4-ee","v8.12.0-rc5","v8.12.0-rc5-ee","v8.12.0-rc6","v8.12.0-rc6-ee","v8.12.0-rc7","v8.12.0-rc7-ee","v8.12.0.pre","v8.12.1","v8.12.1-ee","v8.12.2","v8.12.2-ee","v8.12.3-ee","v8.13.0.pre","v8.14.0.pre","v8.15.0.pre","v8.16.0.pre","v8.17.0.pre","v8.18.0.pre","v8.2.0-ee","v8.2.0.rc1","v8.2.0.rc1-ee","v8.2.0.rc2","v8.2.0.rc2-ee","v8.4.0.rc1","v8.8.0","v8.8.0-ee","v8.8.0-rc1","v8.8.0-rc1-ee","v8.8.0-rc2","v8.8.0-rc2-ee","v8.8.1-ee","v9.1.0.pre","v9.2.0.pre","v9.3.0.pre","v9.5.0.pre","v9.6.0.pre"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45409.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/commit/1ec5392bc506fe43a02dbb66b68741051c5ffeae"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/commit/4865d030cae9705ee5cdb12415c654c634093ae7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/security/advisories/GHSA-jw9c-mfg7-9rx2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-saml/security/advisories/GHSA-cvp8-5r8g-fhvq"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00006.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41586031"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240926-0008/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://ssoready.com/blog/engineering/ruby-saml-pwned-by-xml-signature-wrapping-attacks/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_i
