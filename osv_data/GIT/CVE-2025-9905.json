The vulnerability comes from the fact that the safe_mode=True option is not honored when reading .h5 archives.\n\nNote that the .h5/.hdf5 format is a legacy format supported by Keras 3 for backwards compatibility.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/keras-team/keras","events":[{"introduced":"9c675a9a45e5e8244163fea82efc6066722608a1"},{"fixed":"b491c860fc2750e2b6006b55358d3251dbb4a9f0"}]}],"versions":["v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.10.0","v3.11.0","v3.11.1","v3.11.2","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.5.0","v3.6.0","v3.7.0","v3.8.0","v3.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-9905.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/keras-team/keras/security/advisories/GHSA-36rr-ww3j-vrjv"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/21602"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
