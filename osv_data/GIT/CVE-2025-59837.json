In versions 5.13.4 and later before 5.13.10, the image proxy domain validation can be bypassed by using backslashes in the href parameter, allowing server-side requests to arbitrary URLs. This can lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF) and potentially cross-site scripting (XSS). This vulnerability exists due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2025-58179. Fixed in 5.13.10.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/withastro/astro","events":[{"introduced":"24b04c159ff2e5e1b15efcf8f3a77a131b5a9f92"},{"fixed":"29ff12f2052bcc2ef130f538e10c60b7461f0d53"}]}],"versions":["@astrojs/alpinejs@0.4.9","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.6.6","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.6.7","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.6.8","@astrojs/db@0.17.2","@astrojs/db@0.18.0","@astrojs/markdoc@0.15.6","@astrojs/mdx@4.3.5","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.10","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.9","@astrojs/preact@4.1.1","@astrojs/react@4.3.1","@astrojs/sitemap@3.6.0","@astrojs/solid-js@5.1.1","@astrojs/svelte@7.1.1","@astrojs/vercel@8.2.7","@astrojs/vue@5.1.1","astro@5.13.4","astro@5.13.5","astro@5.13.6","astro@5.13.7","astro@5.13.8","astro@5.13.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59837.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/withastro/astro/security/advisories/GHSA-qcpr-679q-rhm2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/1e2499e8ea83ebfa233a18a7499e1ccf169e56f4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/9ecf3598e2b29dd74614328fde3047ea90e67252"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79","CWE-918"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
