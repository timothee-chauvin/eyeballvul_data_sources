The vulnerability arises due to a hostname confusion between the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` library and the `requests` library. A malicious user can exploit this by submitting a specially crafted URL, such as `http://localhost:\\@google.com/../`, to bypass the SSRF check and perform an SSRF attack.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/significant-gravitas/autogpt","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ff065cd24c2289878c0abdb9adbf91c305f0d70a"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-0454.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/0664fdee-bdc2-4650-8075-74d7b8d3e308"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/significant-gravitas/autogpt/commit/ff065cd24c2289878c0abdb9adbf91c305f0d70a"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
