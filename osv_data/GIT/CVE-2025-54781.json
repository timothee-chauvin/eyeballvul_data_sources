{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-54781","published":"2025-08-01T23:35:23Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:47:50.937155Z","aliases":["GHSA-78qg-vmrw-574w"],"summary":"Himmelblau leaks an Intune service access token in its logs","details":"Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. When debugging is enabled for Himmelblau in version 1.0.0, the himmelblaud_tasks service leaks an Intune service access token to the system journal. This short-lived token can be used to detect the host's Intune compliance status, and may permit additional administrative operations for the Intune host device (though the API for these operations is undocumented). This is fixed in version 1.1.0. To workaround this issue, ensure that Himmelblau debugging is disabled.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau","events":[{"introduced":"d01709bf0100183045927c03b90db78fb8e40bda"},{"fixed":"066993fc7b71e389b9b176e95d371a563c09e33d"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54781.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau/security/advisories/GHSA-78qg-vmrw-574w"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau/commit/2d512bded90ac6a54fcdf737b43ff5d9d4cdb59e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau/releases/tag/1.1.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-532"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
