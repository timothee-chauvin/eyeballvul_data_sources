{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-30371","published":"2025-03-28T14:47:36.718Z","modified":"2025-12-05T08:54:51.650643Z","aliases":["GHSA-8xf9-9jc8-qp98"],"summary":"Metabase vulnerable to circumvention of local link access protection in GeoJson endpoint","details":"Metabase is a business intelligence and embedded analytics tool. Versions prior to v0.52.16.4, v1.52.16.4, v0.53.8, and v1.53.8 are vulnerable to circumvention of local link access protection in GeoJson endpoint. Self hosted Metabase instances that are using the GeoJson feature could be potentially impacted if their Metabase is colocated with other unsecured resources. This is fixed in v0.52.16.4, v1.52.16.4, v0.53.8, and v1.53.8. Migrating to Metabase Cloud or redeploying Metabase in a dedicated subnet with strict outbound port controls is an available workaround.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/metabase/metabase","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"dd8fb9bb9d4b099e5e16aa6f77b29f0966c5c46b"},{"fixed":"b6c06678a6b07f3fd87c3b56138ede0238388cd6"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.52.16.4"},{"fixed":"0.53.8"}]}}],"versions":["0.10.3","0.34.0-rc1","blah","embedding-sdk-0.1.0","embedding-sdk-0.1.10","embedding-sdk-0.1.11","embedding-sdk-0.1.12","embedding-sdk-0.1.13","embedding-sdk-0.1.14","embedding-sdk-0.1.15","embedding-sdk-0.1.16","embedding-sdk-0.1.17","embedding-sdk-0.1.18","embedding-sdk-0.1.19","embedding-sdk-0.1.2","embedding-sdk-0.1.20","embedding-sdk-0.1.21","embedding-sdk-0.1.22","embedding-sdk-0.1.23","embedding-sdk-0.1.24","embedding-sdk-0.1.25","embedding-sdk-0.1.26","embedding-sdk-0.1.27","embedding-sdk-0.1.28","embedding-sdk-0.1.29","embedding-sdk-0.1.30","embedding-sdk-0.1.31","embedding-sdk-0.1.32","embedding-sdk-0.1.33","embedding-sdk-0.1.34","embedding-sdk-0.1.35","embedding-sdk-0.1.36","embedding-sdk-0.1.37","embedding-sdk-0.1.38","embedding-sdk-0.1.4","embedding-sdk-0.1.5","embedding-sdk-0.1.6","embedding-sdk-0.1.7","embedding-sdk-0.1.8","embedding-sdk-0.1.9","embedding-sdk-0.52.1-nightly","embedding-sdk-0.52.10","embedding-sdk-0.52.11","embedding-sdk-0.52.12","embedding-sdk-0.52.13","embedding-sdk-0.52.14","embedding-sdk-0.52.15","embedding-sdk-0.52.16","embedding-sdk-0.52.17","embedding-sdk-0.52.2-nightly","embedding-sdk-0.52.3-nightly","embedding-sdk-0.52.4-nightly","embedding-sdk-0.52.5","embedding-sdk-0.52.5-nightly","embedding-sdk-0.52.6","embedding-sdk-0.52.7","embedding-sdk-0.52.8","embedding-sdk-0.52.9","embedding-sdk-0.53.1-nightly","embedding-sdk-0.53.10","embedding-sdk-0.53.11","embedding-sdk-0.53.12","embedding-sdk-0.53.2","embedding-sdk-0.53.3","embedding-sdk-0.53.4","embedding-sdk-0.53.5","embedding-sdk-0.53.6","embedding-sdk-0.53.7","embedding-sdk-0.53.8","embedding-sdk-0.53.9","embedding-sdk-1.52.1","prettier-1.17.0-package","release-0.32.2","rm","v0.10.0","v0.10.3","v0.10.4","v0.10.4.1","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.11.2","v0.11.3","v0.12.0","v0.12.0-test","v0.12.1","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.13.3","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.19.0","v0.19.1","v0.19.2","v0.19.3","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.20.3","v0.21.0","v0.21.0-rc2","v0.21.0-rc3","v0.21.1","v0.22.0","v0.22.1","v0.23.0","v0.23.0.RC2","v0.23.0.RC3","v0.23.0.RC4","v0.23.1","v0.24.0","v0.24.0.RC1","v0.24.0.RC2","v0.24.0.RC3","v0.24.0.RC4","v0.24.1","v0.24.2","v0.25.0","v0.25.0.RC1","v0.25.0.RC2","v0.26.0","v0.26.0.RC1","v0.26.0.RC2","v0.26.1","v0.28.0","v0.28.0-RC","v0.28.0-RC2","v0.28.0-RC3","v0.28.0.RC1","v0.28.1","v0.29.0","v0.29.0-RC1","v0.29.1","v0.29.2","v0.29.3","v0.30.0","v0.30.0-rc","v0.30.1","v0.30.2","v0.30.3","v0.30.4","v0.31.0","v0.31.0-RC1","v0.31.1","v0.31.2","v0.32.0","v0.32.0-RC1","v0.32.0-RC2","v0.32.1","v0.32.2","v0.32.3","v0.32.4","v0.32.5","v0.32.6","v0.32.7","v0.32.8","v0.33.0","v0.33.0-RC1","v0.33.1","v0.33.2","v0.33.3","v0.33.4","v0.33.5","v0.33.5.1","v0.33.6","v0.33.7","v0.33.7.1","v0.33.7.2","v0.33.7.3","v0.34.0","v0.34.1","v0.34.1-rc-test","v0.34.2","v0.34.3","v0.35.0","v0.35.0-rc1","v0.35.0-rc2","v0.35.1","v0.35.2","v0.35.3","v0.35.4","v0.36.0","v0.36.0-rc1","v0.36.0-snapshot","v0.36.1","v0.36.2","v0.36.3","v0.36.4","v0.36.5","v0.36.5.1","v0.36.6","v0.36.7","v0.36.8","v0.36.8.1","v0.37.0","v0.37.0-rc2","v0.37.0.1","v0.37.0.2","v0.37.1","v0.37.2","v0.37.3","v0.37.4","v0.37.5","v0.37.6","v0.37.7","v0.37.8","v0.38.0","v0.38.0-preview","v0.38.0-rc1","v0.38.0-rc2","v0.38.0-rc3","v0.38.0-rc4","v0.38.0-rc5","v0.38.0.1","v0.38.1","v0.38.2","v0.38.3","v0.38.4","v0.39.0","v0.39.0-rc1","v0.39.0-rc2","v0.39.0.1","v0.39.1","v0.39.2","v0.39.3","v0.39.4","v0.40.0","v0.40.0-rc1-dan","v0.40.0-rc2","v0.41.0-RC1","v0.42.0-preview1","v0.43.0-rc1","v0.44.0-RC1","v0.45.0-RC1","v0.45.0-RC2","v0.47.0-RC1","v0.48.0-RC1","v0.52.0-beta","v0.52.0.1-beta","v0.52.0.2-beta","v0.52.0.3-beta","v0.52.0.4-beta","v0.52.0.5-beta","v0.52.1","v0.52.1.1","v0.52.1.2","v0.52.1.3","v0.52.10","v0.52.10.1","v0.52.10.2","v0.52.10.x","v0.52.11","v0.52.11.1","v0.52.11.2","v0.52.11.x","v0.52.12","v0.52.12.1","v0.52.12.x","v0.52.13","v0.52.13.1","v0.52.13.x","v0.52.14","v0.52.14.1","v0.52.14.2","v0.52.14.x","v0.52.15","v0.52.15.1","v0.52.15.2","v0.52.15.x","v0.52.16","v0.52.16.1","v0.52.16.2","v0.52.16.3","v0.52.2","v0.52.2.1","v0.52.2.2","v0.52.2.3","v0.52.2.4","v0.52.2.5","v0.52.2.6","v0.52.3","v0.52.3.1","v0.52.3.2","v0.52.3.3","v0.52.3.4","v0.52.3.5","v0.52.3.6","v0.52.4","v0.52.4.1","v0.52.4.2","v0.52.4.3","v0.52.4.4","v0.52.4.5","v0.52.4.6","v0.52.4.7","v0.52.5","v0.52.5.1","v0.52.5.2","v0.52.5.3","v0.52.5.4","v0.52.5.5","v0.52.5.6","v0.52.5.x","v0.52.6","v0.52.6.1","v0.52.6.2","v0.52.6.3","v0.52.6.x","v0.52.7","v0.52.7.1","v0.52.7.2","v0.52.7.3","v0.52.7.4","v0.52.7.x","v0.52.8","v0.52.8.1","v0.52.8.2","v0.52.8.3","v0.52.8.4","v0.52.8.5","v
