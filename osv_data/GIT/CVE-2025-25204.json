{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-25204","published":"2025-02-14T16:38:29.038Z","modified":"2025-12-05T08:53:21.380741Z","aliases":["GHSA-fgw4-v983-mgp8","GO-2025-3467"],"related":["CGA-pf9f-25x5-j94p","openSUSE-SU-2025:14889-1"],"summary":"`gh attestation verify` returns incorrect exit code during verification if no attestations are present","details":"`gh` is GitHub’s official command line tool. Starting in version 2.49.0 and prior to version 2.67.0, under certain conditions, a bug in GitHub's Artifact Attestation cli tool `gh attestation verify` causes it to return a zero exit status when no attestations are present. This behavior is incorrect: When no attestations are present, `gh attestation verify` should return a non-zero exit status code, thereby signaling verification failure. An attacker can abuse this flaw to, for example, deploy malicious artifacts in any system that uses `gh attestation verify`'s exit codes to gatekeep deployments. Users are advised to update `gh` to patched version `v2.67.0` as soon as possible.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cli/cli","events":[{"introduced":"f2d6a8ec5c6f56204f6f36339b813252f25a6f51"},{"fixed":"6899fe21dd80873893dd1a3bf3bdd4d33b1b2338"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.49.0"},{"fixed":"2.67.0"}]}}],"versions":["v2.49.0","v2.49.1","v2.49.2","v2.50.0","v2.51.0","v2.52.0","v2.53.0","v2.54.0","v2.55.0","v2.56.0","v2.57.0","v2.58.0","v2.59.0","v2.60.0","v2.60.1","v2.61.0","v2.62.0","v2.63.0","v2.63.1","v2.63.2","v2.64.0","v2.65.0","v2.66.0","v2.66.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-25204.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/25xxx/CVE-2025-25204.json"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/10418"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cli/cli/pull/10421"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-fgw4-v983-mgp8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25204"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-390"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/25xxx/CVE-2025-25204.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
