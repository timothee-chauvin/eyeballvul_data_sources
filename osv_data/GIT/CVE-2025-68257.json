{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68257","published":"2025-12-16T14:44:59.535Z","modified":"2025-12-16T20:22:11.829189Z","summary":"comedi: check device's attached status in compat ioctls","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: check device's attached status in compat ioctls\n\nSyzbot identified an issue [1] that crashes kernel, seemingly due to\nunexistent callback dev->get_valid_routes(). By all means, this should\nnot occur as said callback must always be set to\nget_zero_valid_routes() in __comedi_device_postconfig().\n\nAs the crash seems to appear exclusively in i386 kernels, at least,\njudging from [1] reports, the blame lies with compat versions\nof standard IOCTL handlers. Several of them are modified and\ndo not use comedi_unlocked_ioctl(). While functionality of these\nioctls essentially copy their original versions, they do not\nhave required sanity check for device's attached status. This,\nin turn, leads to a possibility of calling select IOCTLs on a\ndevice that has not been properly setup, even via COMEDI_DEVCONFIG.\n\nDoing so on unconfigured devices means that several crucial steps\nare missed, for instance, specifying dev->get_valid_routes()\ncallback.\n\nFix this somewhat crudely by ensuring device's attached status before\nperforming any ioctls, improving logic consistency between modern\nand compat functions.\n\n[1] Syzbot report:\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\n...\nCR2: ffffffffffffffd6 CR3: 000000006c717000 CR4:
