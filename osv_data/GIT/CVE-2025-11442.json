{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-11442","published":"2025-10-08T08:15:32Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:21:25.168187Z","details":"A security flaw has been discovered in JhumanJ OpnForm up to 1.9.3. The impacted element is an unknown function of the component API Endpoint. The manipulation results in cross-site request forgery. The attack may be performed from remote. The exploit has been released to the public and may be exploited. The vendor has stated that API calls require authentication through Authorization Bearer Tokens, so classic CSRF attacks do not apply here. An attacker would need to possess the JWT through means such as XSS which were mitigated, disabling any form of initial access.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jhumanj/opnform","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"7fcfc727bdb1d9915e87d7da4901bd02187f8f4b"}]}],"versions":["1.3.0","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.5","v1.6","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-11442.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GUjJA9vUbsXUngAv6ySsbCIhVynf8_djardLZYEDOe0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.w5b1nllxwvdq"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.327379"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://vuldb.com/?id.327379"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://vuldb.com/?submit.666889"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
