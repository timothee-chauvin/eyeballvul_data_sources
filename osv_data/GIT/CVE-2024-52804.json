The algorithm used for parsing HTTP cookies in Tornado versions prior to 6.4.2 sometimes has quadratic complexity, leading to excessive CPU consumption when parsing maliciously-crafted cookie headers. This parsing occurs in the event loop thread and may block the processing of other requests. Version 6.4.2 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a5ecfab15e52202a46d34638aad93cddca86d87b"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.2.0","v3.2.0b1","v3.2.0b2","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v4.0.0","v4.0.0b1","v4.0.0b2","v4.0.0b3","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.1.0","v4.1.0b1","v4.1.0b2","v4.2.0","v4.2.0b1","v4.2.1","v4.3.0","v4.3.0b1","v4.3.0b2","v4.4.0","v4.4.0b1","v4.4.1","v4.4.2","v4.4.3","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.5.2","v4.5.3","v5.0.0","v5.0.1","v5.1.0","v5.1.0b1","v6.0.0","v6.0.0b1","v6.1.0","v6.1.0b1","v6.1.0b2","v6.2.0","v6.2.0b1","v6.2.0b2","v6.3.0","v6.3.0b1","v6.3.1","v6.4.0","v6.4.0b1","v6.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-52804.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/52xxx/CVE-2024-52804.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7pwv-g7hj-39pr"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/commit/d5ba4a1695fbf7c6a3e54313262639b198291533"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/security/advisories/GHSA-8w49-h785-mj3c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/01/msg00000.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52804"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-400","CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/52xxx/CVE-2024-52804.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
