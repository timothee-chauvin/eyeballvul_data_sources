It expected that only one new drm_gpuva would be needed on umap\nbut a partial unmap can require 2 new drm_gpuva and that's why it\nended up doing a NULL pointer dereference causing a kernel panic.\n\nFollowing dump was seen when partial unmap was exercised.\n Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000078\n Mem abort info:\n   ESR =
