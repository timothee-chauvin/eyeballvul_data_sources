{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-7394","published":"2025-07-18T23:15:23.470Z","modified":"2025-12-05T12:32:37.828881Z","details":"In the OpenSSL compatibility layer implementation, the function RAND_poll() was not behaving as expected and leading to the potential for predictable values returned from RAND_bytes() after fork() is called. This can lead to weak or predictable random numbers generated in applications that are both using RAND_bytes() and doing fork() operations. This only affects applications explicitly calling RAND_bytes() after fork() and does not affect any internal TLS operations. Although RAND_bytes() documentation in OpenSSL calls out not being safe for use with fork() without first calling RAND_poll(), an additional code change was also made in wolfSSL to make RAND_bytes() behave similar to OpenSSL after a fork() call without calling RAND_poll(). Now the Hash-DRBG used gets reseeded after detecting running in a new process. If making use of RAND_bytes() and calling fork() we recommend updating to the latest version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Per Allansson from Appgate for the report.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl","events":[{"introduced":"b63d3173a1fa2792efda89d0e6706900250131ea"},{"last_affected":"b077c81eb635392e694ccedbab8b644297ec0285"}]}],"versions":["WCv4-rng-stable","WCv4-stable","WCv4.0-RC5","WCv4.0-RC6","WCv4.0-RC8","WCv4.0-RC9","WCv5.0-RC10","WCv5.0-RC11","WCv5.0-RC12","WCv5.0-RC9","WCv5.2.1-PILOT","l","list","v3.15.0-stable","v3.15.3-stable","v3.15.5-stable","v3.15.5a","v3.15.6","v3.15.7-stable","v3.15.8","v4.0.0-stable","v4.1.0-stable","v4.2.0-stable","v4.2.0c","v4.3.0-stable","v4.4.0-stable","v4.5.0-stable","v4.6.0-stable","v4.7.0-stable","v4.7.1r","v4.8.0-stable","v5.0.0-stable","v5.1.0-stable","v5.2.0-stable","v5.2.1","v5.3.0-stable","v5.4.0-stable","v5.5.0-stable","v5.5.1-stable","v5.5.2-stable","v5.5.3-stable","v5.5.4-stable","v5.6.0-stable","v5.6.2-stable","v5.6.3-stable","v5.6.4-stable","v5.6.6-stable","v5.7.0-stable","v5.7.2-stable","v5.7.4-stable","v5.7.6-stable","v5.8.0-stable","wolfEntropy1","wolfRand-RC2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-7394.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#wolfssl-release-582-july-17-2025"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
