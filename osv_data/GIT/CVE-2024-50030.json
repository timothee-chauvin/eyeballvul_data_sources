Also we have some dependent\nloads and stores for which we need the correct ordering, and we lack the\nneeded barriers. Fix this by grabbing the ct->lock after the wait, which\nis also held by the completion side.\n\nv2 (Badal):\n - Also print done after acquiring the lock and seeing timeout.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 52789ce35c55ccd30c4b67b9cc5b2af55e0122ea)","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"dd08ebf6c3525a7ea2186e636df064ea47281987"},{"fixed":"8ed7dd4c55e4fb21531a9645aeb66a30eaf43a46"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"dd08ebf6c3525a7ea2186e636df064ea47281987"},{"fixed":"db7f92af626178ba59dbbcdd5dee9ec24a987a88"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.11.1","v6.11.2","v6.11.3","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.7","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-50030.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.11.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-50030.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8ed7dd4c55e4fb21531a9645aeb66a30eaf43a46"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/db7f92af626178ba59dbbcdd5dee9ec24a987a88"}]}
