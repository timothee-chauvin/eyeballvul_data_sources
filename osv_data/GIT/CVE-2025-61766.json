Prior to version 1.0.0, infinite recursion can occur if a user queries a bucket using the `!=` comparator. This will result in PHP's call stack limit exceeding, and/or increased memory consumption, potentially leading to a denial of service. Version 1.0.0 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/weirdgloop/mediawiki-extensions-bucket","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6f4a71d531cb802cdb991d2a4ca7bf8fb691defd"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-61766.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/61xxx/CVE-2025-61766.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/weirdgloop/mediawiki-extensions-Bucket/blob/ad704120a1660b5929fb5825db1cf85c9c77acf4/includes/Expression/MemberOfExpression.php#L34"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/weirdgloop/mediawiki-extensions-Bucket/commit/6f4a71d531cb802cdb991d2a4ca7bf8fb691defd"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/weirdgloop/mediawiki-extensions-Bucket/security/advisories/GHSA-r9f2-4jh3-659j"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61766"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-674"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/61xxx/CVE-2025-61766.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
