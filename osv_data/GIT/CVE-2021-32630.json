{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-32630","published":"2021-05-20T17:15:07Z","modified":"2025-10-21T06:22:34.632648Z","related":["GHSA-xpqj-67r8-25j2"],"details":"Admidio is a free, open source user management system for websites of organizations and groups. In Admidio before version 4.0.4, there is an authenticated RCE via .phar file upload. A php web shell can be uploaded via the Documents & Files upload feature. Someone with upload permissions could rename the php shell with a .phar extension, visit the file, triggering the payload for a reverse/bind shell. This can be mitigated by excluding a .phar file extension to be uploaded (like you did with .php .phtml .php5 etc). The vulnerability is patched in version 4.0.4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/admidio/admidio","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d850a871e349091e0f038f0b6d60a71f53403162"}]}],"versions":["3.0-Beta.1","3.0-Beta.2","3.0-Beta.3","3.0-Beta.4","3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.6","v3.1-Beta.1","v3.1-Beta.2","v3.1-Beta.3","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.1.4","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.1.9","v3.2-Beta.1","v3.2-Beta.2","v3.2-Beta.3","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.10","v3.2.11","v3.2.12","v3.2.13","v3.2.14","v3.2.15","v3.2.2","v3.2.3","v3.2.4","v3.2.5","v3.2.5.1","v3.2.6","v3.2.7","v3.2.8","v3.2.9","v3.3-Beta.1","v3.3-Beta.2","v3.3-Beta.3","v3.3-Beta.4","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.10","v3.3.11","v3.3.12","v3.3.13","v3.3.14","v3.3.15","v3.3.16","v3.3.17","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.3.4","v3.3.5","v3.3.6","v3.3.7","v3.3.8","v3.3.9","v4.0-Beta.1","v4.0-Beta.2","v4.0-Beta.3","v4.0-Beta.4","v4.0-Beta.5","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.1.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32630.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/issues/994"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/releases/tag/v4.0.4"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/security/advisories/GHSA-xpqj-67r8-25j2"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
