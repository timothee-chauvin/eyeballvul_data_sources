In 136 and earlier, a path-traversal flaw in the handling of the X-Zone-Id HTTP header allows an attacker to cause the application to write files outside the intended storage location. The header value is used to build a filesystem path but is not properly canonicalized or restricted to the applicationâ€™s storage base directory. As a result, supplying ../ sequences in X-Zone-Id causes files to be written to arbitrary directories.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/esm-dev/esm.sh","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1ad31b6352bb0a064ece812f6f360e4850e16051"}]}],"versions":["v100","v101","v102","v103","v104","v105","v106","v107","v108","v109","v110","v111","v112","v113","v114","v115","v116","v117","v119","v120","v121","v122","v123","v124","v125","v126","v127","v128","v129","v130","v131","v132","v133","v134","v135","v135_1","v136","v34","v35","v37","v38","v39","v40","v41","v43","v44","v45","v46","v47","v49","v50","v51","v52","v53","v55","v56","v57","v59","v60","v61","v62","v63","v64","v65","v66","v67","v68","v69","v70","v71","v72","v73","v74","v75","v76","v77","v78","v79","v80","v81","v82","v83","v84","v85","v86","v87","v88","v89","v90","v91","v92","v93","v94","v95","v96","v97","v98","v99"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59342.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/esm-dev/esm.sh/security/advisories/GHSA-g2h5-cvvr-7gmw"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/esm-dev/esm.sh/blob/main/server/router.go#L116"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/esm-dev/esm.sh/blob/main/server/router.go#L411"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-24"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
