Prior to version 0.3.0, default functions don't respect nonreentrancy keys and the lock isn't emitted. No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, using a lock on a `default` function is a very sparsely used pattern. As such, the impact is low. Version 0.3.0 contains a patch for the issue.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8a23febbb2d523f3701f9a7d0aaf361c104a2a37"}]}],"versions":["0.2.1","v0.0.4","v0.1.0-beta.1","v0.1.0-beta.10","v0.1.0-beta.11","v0.1.0-beta.12","v0.1.0-beta.13","v0.1.0-beta.14","v0.1.0-beta.15","v0.1.0-beta.16","v0.1.0-beta.17","v0.1.0-beta.2","v0.1.0-beta.3","v0.1.0-beta.4","v0.1.0-beta.5","v0.1.0-beta.6","v0.1.0-beta.7","v0.1.0-beta.8","v0.1.0-beta.9","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.10","v0.2.11","v0.2.12","v0.2.13","v0.2.14","v0.2.15","v0.2.16","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.8","v0.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-32648.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/32xxx/CVE-2024-32648.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/93287e5ac184b53b395c907d40701f721daf8177"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/2455"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-m2v9-w374-5hj9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32648"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-667"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/32xxx/CVE-2024-32648.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
