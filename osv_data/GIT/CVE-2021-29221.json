{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-29221","published":"2021-04-09T14:15:12Z","modified":"2025-10-21T06:06:01.312462Z","details":"A local privilege escalation vulnerability was discovered in Erlang/OTP prior to version 23.2.3. By adding files to an existing installation's directory, a local attacker could hijack accounts of other users running Erlang programs or possibly coerce a service running with \"erlsrv.exe\" to execute arbitrary code as Local System. This can occur only under specific conditions on Windows with unsafe filesystem permissions.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/erlang/otp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"050a78f8a67ed76a632f0e73b76ceb83e7054e5f"}]}],"versions":["OTP-17.0","OTP-17.0.1","OTP-17.0.2","OTP-17.1","OTP-17.1.1","OTP-17.1.2","OTP-17.2","OTP-17.2.1","OTP-17.2.2","OTP-17.3","OTP-17.3.1","OTP-17.3.2","OTP-17.3.3","OTP-17.3.4","OTP-17.4","OTP-17.4.1","OTP-17.5","OTP-17.5.1","OTP-17.5.2","OTP-17.5.3","OTP-17.5.4","OTP-17.5.5","OTP-17.5.6","OTP-17.5.6.1","OTP-17.5.6.10","OTP-17.5.6.2","OTP-17.5.6.3","OTP-17.5.6.4","OTP-17.5.6.5","OTP-17.5.6.6","OTP-17.5.6.7","OTP-17.5.6.8","OTP-17.5.6.9","OTP-18.0","OTP-18.0-rc1","OTP-18.0-rc2","OTP-18.0.1","OTP-18.0.2","OTP-18.0.3","OTP-18.1","OTP-18.1.1","OTP-18.1.2","OTP-18.1.3","OTP-18.1.4","OTP-18.1.5","OTP-18.2","OTP-18.2.1","OTP-18.2.2","OTP-18.2.3","OTP-18.2.4","OTP-18.2.4.0.1","OTP-18.2.4.1","OTP-18.3","OTP-18.3.1","OTP-18.3.2","OTP-18.3.3","OTP-18.3.4","OTP-18.3.4.1","OTP-18.3.4.1.1","OTP-18.3.4.10","OTP-18.3.4.11","OTP-18.3.4.2","OTP-18.3.4.3","OTP-18.3.4.4","OTP-18.3.4.5","OTP-18.3.4.6","OTP-18.3.4.7","OTP-18.3.4.8","OTP-18.3.4.9","OTP-19.0","OTP-19.0-rc1","OTP-19.0-rc2","OTP-19.0.1","OTP-19.0.2","OTP-19.0.3","OTP-19.0.4","OTP-19.0.5","OTP-19.0.6","OTP-19.0.7","OTP-19.1","OTP-19.1.1","OTP-19.1.2","OTP-19.1.3","OTP-19.1.4","OTP-19.1.5","OTP-19.1.6","OTP-19.1.6.1","OTP-19.2","OTP-19.2.1","OTP-19.2.2","OTP-19.2.3","OTP-19.2.3.1","OTP-19.3","OTP-19.3.1","OTP-19.3.2","OTP-19.3.3","OTP-19.3.4","OTP-19.3.5","OTP-19.3.6","OTP-19.3.6.1","OTP-19.3.6.10","OTP-19.3.6.11","OTP-19.3.6.12","OTP-19.3.6.13","OTP-19.3.6.2","OTP-19.3.6.3","OTP-19.3.6.4","OTP-19.3.6.5","OTP-19.3.6.6","OTP-19.3.6.7","OTP-19.3.6.8","OTP-19.3.6.9","OTP-20.0","OTP-20.0-rc1","OTP-20.0-rc2","OTP-20.0.1","OTP-20.0.2","OTP-20.0.3","OTP-20.0.4","OTP-20.0.5","OTP-20.1","OTP-20.1.1","OTP-20.1.2","OTP-20.1.3","OTP-20.1.4","OTP-20.1.5","OTP-20.1.6","OTP-20.1.7","OTP-20.1.7.1","OTP-20.2","OTP-20.2.0.1","OTP-20.2.1","OTP-20.2.2","OTP-20.2.3","OTP-20.2.4","OTP-20.3","OTP-20.3.1","OTP-20.3.2","OTP-20.3.2.1","OTP-20.3.3","OTP-20.3.4","OTP-20.3.5","OTP-20.3.6","OTP-20.3.7","OTP-20.3.8","OTP-20.3.8.1","OTP-20.3.8.10","OTP-20.3.8.11","OTP-20.3.8.12","OTP-20.3.8.13","OTP-20.3.8.14","OTP-20.3.8.15","OTP-20.3.8.16","OTP-20.3.8.17","OTP-20.3.8.18","OTP-20.3.8.19","OTP-20.3.8.2","OTP-20.3.8.20","OTP-20.3.8.21","OTP-20.3.8.22","OTP-20.3.8.23","OTP-20.3.8.24","OTP-20.3.8.25","OTP-20.3.8.26","OTP-20.3.8.3","OTP-20.3.8.4","OTP-20.3.8.5","OTP-20.3.8.6","OTP-20.3.8.7","OTP-20.3.8.8","OTP-20.3.8.9","OTP-21.0","OTP-21.0-rc1","OTP-21.0-rc2","OTP-21.0.1","OTP-21.0.2","OTP-21.0.3","OTP-21.0.4","OTP-21.0.5","OTP-21.0.6","OTP-21.0.7","OTP-21.0.8","OTP-21.0.9","OTP-21.1","OTP-21.1.1","OTP-21.1.2","OTP-21.1.3","OTP-21.1.4","OTP-21.2","OTP-21.2.1","OTP-21.2.2","OTP-21.2.3","OTP-21.2.4","OTP-21.2.5","OTP-21.2.6","OTP-21.2.7","OTP-21.3","OTP-21.3.1","OTP-21.3.2","OTP-21.3.3","OTP-21.3.4","OTP-21.3.5","OTP-21.3.6","OTP-21.3.7","OTP-21.3.7.1","OTP-21.3.8","OTP-21.3.8.1","OTP-21.3.8.10","OTP-21.3.8.11","OTP-21.3.8.12","OTP-21.3.8.13","OTP-21.3.8.14","OTP-21.3.8.15","OTP-21.3.8.16","OTP-21.3.8.17","OTP-21.3.8.18","OTP-21.3.8.2","OTP-21.3.8.3","OTP-21.3.8.4","OTP-21.3.8.5","OTP-21.3.8.6","OTP-21.3.8.7","OTP-21.3.8.8","OTP-21.3.8.9","OTP-22.0","OTP-22.0-rc1","OTP-22.0-rc2","OTP-22.0-rc3","OTP-22.0.1","OTP-22.0.2","OTP-22.0.3","OTP-22.0.4","OTP-22.0.5","OTP-22.0.6","OTP-22.0.7","OTP-22.1","OTP-22.1.1","OTP-22.1.2","OTP-22.1.3","OTP-22.1.4","OTP-22.1.5","OTP-22.1.6","OTP-22.1.7","OTP-22.1.8","OTP-22.1.8.1","OTP-22.2","OTP-22.2.1","OTP-22.2.2","OTP-22.2.3","OTP-22.2.4","OTP-22.2.5","OTP-22.2.6","OTP-22.2.7","OTP-22.2.8","OTP-22.3","OTP-22.3.1","OTP-22.3.2","OTP-22.3.3","OTP-22.3.4","OTP-22.3.4.1","OTP-22.3.4.10","OTP-22.3.4.11","OTP-22.3.4.12","OTP-22.3.4.13","OTP-22.3.4.2","OTP-22.3.4.3","OTP-22.3.4.4","OTP-22.3.4.5","OTP-22.3.4.6","OTP-22.3.4.7","OTP-22.3.4.8","OTP-22.3.4.9","OTP-23.0","OTP-23.0-rc1","OTP-23.0-rc2","OTP-23.0-rc3","OTP-23.0.1","OTP-23.0.2","OTP-23.0.3","OTP-23.0.4","OTP-23.1","OTP-23.1.1","OTP-23.1.2","OTP-23.1.3","OTP-23.1.4","OTP-23.1.5","OTP-23.2","OTP-23.2.1","OTP-23.2.2","OTP_17.0-rc1","OTP_17.0-rc2","OTP_R13B03","OTP_R13B04","OTP_R14A","OTP_R14B","OTP_R14B01","OTP_R14B02","OTP_R14B03","OTP_R14B04","OTP_R15A","OTP_R15B","OTP_R15B01","OTP_R15B02","OTP_R15B03","OTP_R15B03-1","OTP_R16A_RELEASE_CANDIDATE","OTP_R16B","OTP_R16B01","OTP_R16B01_RC1","OTP_R16B02","OTP_R16B03","OTP_R16B03-1","OTP_R16B03_yielding_binary_to_term","R16B02_yielding_binary_to_term"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-29221.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://deepsurface.com/deepsurface-security-advisory-local-privilege-escalation-in-erlang-on-windows-cve-2021-29221/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-23.2.3"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
