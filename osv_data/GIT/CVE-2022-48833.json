Later on,\nwhen trying to free the log tree with free_log_tree(), which iterates\nover the tree, we can end up getting an -EIO error when trying to read\na node or a leaf, since read_extent_buffer_pages() returns -EIO if an\nextent buffer does not have EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE set and has the\nEXTENT_BUFFER_WRITE_ERR bit set. Getting that -EIO means that we return\nimmediately as we can not iterate over the entire tree.\n\nIn that case we never update the reserved space for an extent buffer in\nthe respective block group and space_info object.\n\nWhen this happens we get the following traces when unmounting the fs:\n\n[174957.284509] BTRFS: error (device dm-0) in cleanup_transaction:1913: errno=-5 IO
