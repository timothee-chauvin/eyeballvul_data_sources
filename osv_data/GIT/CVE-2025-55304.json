{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-55304","published":"2025-08-29T15:00:05Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:47:59.414909Z","aliases":["GHSA-m54q-mm9w-fp6g"],"summary":"Exiv2 has quadratic performance in ICC profile parsing in JpegBase::readMetadata","details":"Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. A denial-of-service was found in Exiv2 version 0.28.5: a quadratic algorithm in the ICC profile parsing code in jpegBase::readMetadata() can cause Exiv2 to run for a long time. The denial-of-service is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted jpg image file. The bug is fixed in version 0.28.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/exiv2/exiv2","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4654b52fb2026d1565570dbe411017d9431a7f40"}]}],"versions":["0.27","0.27-RC2","0.27-RC3","0.27.1","testIPO","testIPO_2","testIPO_3","testIPO_exiv2-xmp-OBJECT","testNoConanCache","v0.10","v0.11","v0.12","v0.13","v0.14","v0.15","v0.16","v0.16-pre1","v0.17","v0.17.1","v0.18","v0.18-pre1","v0.18-pre2","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.19","v0.20","v0.21","v0.21.1","v0.22","v0.23","v0.23.1","v0.24","v0.25","v0.26","v0.27-RC1","v0.27.0","v0.27.1","v0.27.1-RC1","v0.27.2","v0.27.2-RC1","v0.27.2-RC2","v0.27.2-RC3","v0.27.3","v0.27.3-RC1","v0.27.3-RC2","v0.27.4-RC1","v0.27.4-RC2","v0.28.0","v0.28.1","v0.28.2","v0.28.3","v0.28.4","v0.28.5","v0.3","v0.4","v0.5","v0.6","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.7","v0.8","v0.9","v0.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-55304.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-m54q-mm9w-fp6g"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/3335"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/3345"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/3333"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-407"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
