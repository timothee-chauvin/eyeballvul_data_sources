Prior to version 7.2.7, the input parameter, which consists of a file path and name, can be manipulated to return the Content-Type header with text/html if the name part ends with .html. This could allow malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the browser. For a successful attack, a malicious file needs to be uploaded beforehand. This issue has been patched in version 7.2.7. A workaround is provided on the Jmix documentation website.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cuba-platform/restapi","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"60fc55de808e5f1a70de8be342814b43c0553e44"}]}],"versions":["v7.2.0","v7.2.0.BETA1","v7.2.0.BETA2","v7.2.2","v7.2.3","v7.2.5","v7.2.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-32960.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html#disable-files-endpoint-in-cuba-application"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cuba-platform/restapi/commit/b3d599f6657d7e212fdb134a61ab5e0888669eb1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cuba-platform/restapi/security/advisories/GHSA-88h5-34xw-2q56"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/security/advisories/GHSA-x27v-f838-jh93"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
