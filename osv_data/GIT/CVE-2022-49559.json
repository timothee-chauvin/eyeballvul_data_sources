In normal operation, the sanity\ncheck is perfectly valid, but it incorrectly assumes that it's impossible\nfor userspace to induce KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT without bouncing through\nKVM_RUN (which guarantees kvm_check_nested_state() will see and handle\nthe triple fault).\n\nThe WARN can currently be triggered if userspace injects a machine check\nwhile L2 is active and CR4.MCE=0.  And a future fix to allow save/restore\nof KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT, e.g. so that a synthesized triple fault isn't\nlost on migration, will make it trivially easy for userspace to trigger\nthe WARN.\n\nClearing KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT when forcibly leaving guest mode is\ntempting, but wrong, especially if/when the request is saved/restored,\ne.g. if userspace restores events (including a triple fault) and then\nrestores nested state (which may forcibly leave guest mode).  Ignoring\nthe fact that KVM doesn't currently provide the necessary APIs, it's\nuserspace's responsibility to manage pending events during save/restore.\n\n  ------------[ cut here ]------------\n  WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 1399 at arch/x86/kvm/vmx/nested.c:4522 nested_vmx_vmexit+0x7fe/0xd90 [kvm_intel]\n  Modules linked in: kvm_intel kvm irqbypass\n  CPU: 7 PID: 1399 Comm: state_test Not tainted 5.17.0-rc3+ #808\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015\n  RIP: 0010:nested_vmx_vmexit+0x7fe/0xd90 [kvm_intel]\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   vmx_leave_nested+0x30/0x40 [kvm_intel]\n   vmx_set_nested_state+0xca/0x3e0 [kvm_intel]\n   kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl+0xf49/0x13e0 [kvm]\n   kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x4b9/0x660 [kvm]\n   __x64_sys_ioctl+0x83/0xb0\n   do_syscall_64+0x3b/0xc0\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n   </TASK>\n  ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"cb6a32c2b8777ad31a02e585584d869251a790e3"},{"fixed":"8d3a2aa0976f57320ba89baf9d57fb158dd0cd0d"},{"fixed":"f476a59d5c86c02a79eef893c6da86735f2977ac"},{"fixed":"7de373c9b48229e428ecdb8fbde269c5a8617fd2"},{"fixed":"45846661d10422ce9e22da21f8277540b29eca22"}]}],"versions":["v5.12","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.5","v5.15.6","v5.15.7","v5.15.8","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.17.1","v5.17.10","v5.17.11","v5.17.12","v5.17.2","v5.17.3","v5.17.4","v5.17.5","v5.17.6","v5.17.7","v5.17.8","v5.17.9","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.18.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49559.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.13.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.45"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.17.13"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.18.0"},{"fixed":"5.18.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49559.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/45846661d10422ce9e22da21f8277540b29eca22"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7de373c9b48229e428ecdb8fbde269c5a8617fd2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d3a2aa0976f57320ba89baf9d57fb158dd0cd0d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f476a59d5c86c02a79eef893c6da86735f2977ac"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49559.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49559"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49559.json"}}
