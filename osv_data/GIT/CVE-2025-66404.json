Prior to 2.9.8, there is a security issue exists in the exec_in_pod tool of the mcp-server-kubernetes MCP Server. The tool accepts user-provided commands in both array and string formats. When a string format is provided, it is passed directly to shell interpretation (sh -c) without input validation, allowing shell metacharacters to be interpreted. This vulnerability can be exploited through direct command injection or indirect prompt injection attacks, where AI agents may execute commands without explicit user intent. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.9.8.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3fe655f07301464320bbdc0e013d6def126ae0e5"}]}],"versions":["0.2.4","0.2.5","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.4.0","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","2.0.0","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","2.4.5","2.4.6","2.4.7","2.4.9","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.6.0","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.9.0","2.9.1","2.9.2","2.9.3","2.9.4","2.9.5","2.9.6","2.9.7","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.5","v2.4.6","v2.4.7","v2.4.8","v2.4.9","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v2.9.2","v2.9.3","v2.9.4","v2.9.5","v2.9.6","v2.9.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66404.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66404.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes/commit/d091107ff92d9ffad1b3c295092f142d6578c48b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes/security/advisories/GHSA-wvxp-jp4w-w8wg"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66404"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-77"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66404.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
