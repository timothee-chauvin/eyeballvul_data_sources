{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2020-14368","published":"2020-12-14T21:15:18Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:34:49Z","details":"A flaw was found in Eclipse Che in versions prior to 7.14.0 that impacts CodeReady Workspaces. When configured with cookies authentication, Theia IDE doesn't properly set the SameSite value, allowing a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and consequently allowing a cross-site WebSocket hijack on Theia IDE. This flaw allows an attacker to gain full access to the victim's workspace through the /services endpoint. To perform a successful attack, the attacker conducts a Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) and tricks the victim into executing a request via an untrusted link, which performs the CSRF and the Socket hijack. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/eclipse/che","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9b1f11fe652dc77dec5a216ed12d0aba631dc9fb"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-14368.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1823892"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
