{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-3028","published":"2024-04-16T00:15:11.667Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:35:19.229156Z","details":"mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to improper input validation, allowing attackers to read and delete arbitrary files on the server. By manipulating the 'logo_filename' parameter in the 'system-preferences' API endpoint, an attacker can construct requests to read sensitive files or the application's '.env' file, and even delete files by setting the 'logo_filename' to the path of the target file and invoking the 'remove-logo' API endpoint. This vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7de23dbb2da932fbfb39f56d981784d3702cf5ce"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-3028.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/41016b86-eabb-4161-ac81-40a1ca8e82ac"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/7de23dbb2da932fbfb39f56d981784d3702cf5ce"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
