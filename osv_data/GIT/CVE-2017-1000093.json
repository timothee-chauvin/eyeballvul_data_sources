This allowed attackers to initiate polling of projects with a known name. While Jenkins in general does not consider polling to be a protection-worthy action as it's similar to cache invalidation, the plugin specifically adds a permission to be able to use this functionality, and this issue undermines that permission.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jenkinsci/pollscm-plugin","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"b278f8747fc9b27f70e53c992061f194634430fd"}]}],"versions":["pollscm-1.0","pollscm-1.1","pollscm-1.3","pollscm-1.3.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-1000093.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-07-10/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
