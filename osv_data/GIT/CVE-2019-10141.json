{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2019-10141","published":"2019-07-30T17:15:12.453Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:35:44.414454Z","aliases":["GHSA-c7fc-cm7p-92r2","PYSEC-2019-152"],"details":"A vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic-inspector all versions excluding 5.0.2, 6.0.3, 7.2.4, 8.0.3 and 8.2.1. A SQL-injection vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic-inspector's node_cache.find_node(). This function makes a SQL query using unfiltered data from a server reporting inspection results (by a POST to the /v1/continue endpoint). Because the API is unauthenticated, the flaw could be exploited by an attacker with access to the network on which ironic-inspector is listening. Because of how ironic-inspector uses the query results, it is unlikely that data could be obtained. However, the attacker could pass malicious data and create a denial of service.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openstack/ironic-inspector","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"53f44a7ccf8164d19031266a35e341cc557ee84a"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-10141.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2505"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-10141"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/ocata.html#relnotes-5-0-2-7-origin-stable-ocata"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/pike.html#relnotes-6-0-3-4-stable-pike"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/queens.html#relnotes-7-2-4-stable-queens"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/rocky.html#relnotes-8-0-3-stable-rocky"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/stein.html#relnotes-8-2-1-stable-stein"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
