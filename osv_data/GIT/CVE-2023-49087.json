{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-49087","published":"2023-11-30T05:20:28.298Z","modified":"2025-12-05T00:11:51.017960Z","aliases":["GHSA-ww7x-3gxh-qm6r"],"summary":"Validation of SignedInfo","details":"xml-security is a library that implements XML signatures and encryption. Validation of an XML signature requires verification that the hash value of the related XML-document matches a specific DigestValue-value, but also that the cryptographic signature on the SignedInfo-tree (the one that contains the DigestValue) verifies and matches a trusted public key. If an attacker somehow (i.e. by exploiting a bug in PHP's canonicalization function) manages to manipulate the canonicalized version's DigestValue, it would be possible to forge the signature. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.12 and 5.0.0-alpha.13.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-security","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f509e3083dd7870cce5880c804b5122317287581"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.10","v0.0.11","v0.0.2","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.3.0","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.4.1","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.5.7","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.10","v1.6.11","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.6.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-49087.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/49xxx/CVE-2023-49087.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-security/commit/f509e3083dd7870cce5880c804b5122317287581"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-security/security/advisories/GHSA-ww7x-3gxh-qm6r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49087"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-345"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/49xxx/CVE-2023-49087.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
