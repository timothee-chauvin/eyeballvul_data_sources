{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-51006","published":"2025-09-22T14:15:49Z","modified":"2025-10-22T16:20:34.859966Z","details":"Within tcpreplay's tcprewrite, a double free vulnerability has been identified in the dlt_linuxsll2_cleanup() function in plugins/dlt_linuxsll2/linuxsll2.c. This vulnerability is triggered when tcpedit_dlt_cleanup() indirectly invokes the cleanup routine multiple times on the same memory region. By supplying a specifically crafted pcap file to the tcprewrite binary, a local attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via memory corruption.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0ba7d17fcb9ddedf61168f99c249b30731310d4e"}]}],"versions":["help","v3.4.2","v3.4.3","v3.4.4","v4.0.0","v4.0.0beta1","v4.0.0beta2","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.5","v4.0.5beta1","v4.0.5beta2","v4.0.5beta3","v4.1.0","v4.1.0beta1","v4.1.0beta2","v4.1.1","v4.1.1-beta2","v4.1.1-beta3","v4.1.2","v4.2.0","v4.2.0-beta1","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.2.2-beta1","v4.2.3","v4.2.4","v4.2.5","v4.2.5-beta1","v4.2.6","v4.3.0","v4.3.0-beta1","v4.3.0-beta2","v4.3.1","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v4.3.3-beta1","v4.3.4","v4.3.4-beta1","v4.3.4-rc1","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.4.2","v4.4.2-beta1","v4.4.3","v4.4.4","v4.5.0-beta1","v4.5.0-beta2","v4.5.0-beta3","v4.5.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-51006.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/sy460129/CVE-2025-51006"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/issues/926"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
