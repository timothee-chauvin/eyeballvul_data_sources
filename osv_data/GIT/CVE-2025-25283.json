Versions prior to 2.1.3 are vulnerable to an event loop delay due to the CPU-bound operation of resolving the provided string, from a 0.5ms and up to ~50ms per one operation, with a varying size from 0.01 MB and up to 4.3 MB respectively, and an out of memory that would crash a running Node.js application due to a string size of roughly 10 MB that utilizes unicode characters. Version 2.1.3 contains a patch.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jkroso/parse-duration","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"92bb91f111a57604c2b8c72373f605c1cdf1f895"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.3.0","0.4.0","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.4.0","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-25283.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jkroso/parse-duration/commit/9e88421bfd41806fa4b473bfb28a9ee9dafc27d7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jkroso/parse-duration/releases/tag/v2.1.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/jkroso/parse-duration/security/advisories/GHSA-hcrg-fc28-fcg5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1333"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
