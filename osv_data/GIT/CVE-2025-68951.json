Versions 4.0.14 and 4.0.15 have a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in an administrator’s browser by registering a user whose display name contains HTML entities. When an administrator views the admin user list, the payload is decoded server-side and rendered without escaping, resulting in script execution in the admin context. Version 4.0.16 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/thorsten/phpmyfaq","events":[{"introduced":"e711096c2a49597f8f87534b35e2b4df8309606f"},{"fixed":"fe206674c07c5ad9e5013c3068ade4ce0cb66f89"}]}],"versions":["4.0.14","4.0.15"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68951.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68951.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/commit/61829e83411f7b28bc6fd1052bfde54c32c6c370"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/commit/8211d1d25951b4c272443cfc3ef9c09b1363fd87"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/security/advisories/GHSA-jv8r-hv7q-p6vc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68951"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68951.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
