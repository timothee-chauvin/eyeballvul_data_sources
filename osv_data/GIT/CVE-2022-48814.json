But there is one more which\napplies here.\n\nIf the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown\n(like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device link\nbetween the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers()\nwill unbind the seville switch driver on shutdown.\n\nSo the same treatment must be applied to all DSA switch drivers, which\nis: either use devres for both the mdiobus allocation and registration,\nor don't use devres at all.\n\nThe seville driver has a code structure that could accommodate both the\nmdiobus_unregister and mdiobus_free calls, but it has an external\ndependency upon mscc_miim_setup() from mdio-mscc-miim.c, which calls\ndevm_mdiobus_alloc_size() on its behalf. So rather than restructuring\nthat, and exporting yet one more symbol mscc_miim_teardown(), let's work\nwith devres and replace of_mdiobus_register with the devres variant.\nWhen we use all-devres, we can ensure that devres doesn't free a\nstill-registered bus (it either runs both callbacks, or none).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ac3a68d56651c3dad2c12c7afce065fe15267f44"},{"fixed":"1d13e7221035947c62800c9d3d99b4ed570e27e7"},{"fixed":"0e816362d823cd46c666e64d8bffe329ee22f4cc"},{"fixed":"bd488afc3b39e045ba71aab472233f2a78726e7b"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.3","v5.15.4","v5.15.5","v5.15.6","v5.15.7","v5.15.8","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.16.1","v5.16.2","v5.16.3","v5.16.4","v5.16.5","v5.16.6","v5.16.7","v5.16.8","v5.16.9","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.8","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-48814.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.9.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.27"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.16.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-48814.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0e816362d823cd46c666e64d8bffe329ee22f4cc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1d13e7221035947c62800c9d3d99b4ed570e27e7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bd488afc3b39e045ba71aab472233f2a78726e7b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/48xxx/CVE-2022-48814.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48814"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/48xxx/CVE-2022-48814.json"}}
