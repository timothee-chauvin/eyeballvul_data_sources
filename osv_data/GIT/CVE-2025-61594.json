{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-61594","published":"2025-12-30T21:03:08.990Z","modified":"2025-12-31T02:49:20.266224Z","aliases":["GHSA-j4pr-3wm6-xx2r"],"summary":"URI Credential Leakage Bypass over CVE-2025-27221","details":"URI is a module providing classes to handle Uniform Resource Identifiers. In versions prior to 0.12.5, 0.13.3, and 1.0.4, a bypass exists for the fix to CVE-2025-27221 that can expose user credentials. When using the `+` operator to combine URIs, sensitive information like passwords from the original URI can be leaked, violating RFC3986 and making applications vulnerable to credential exposure. Versions 0.12.5, 0.13.3, and 1.0.4 fix the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ruby/uri","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8cf5a496c1f8e5fe58c0c605ad96d12a051e24c6"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.12.5"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ruby/uri","events":[{"introduced":"b50d37f7a193991c56bda7f94e8dd6fec0bb3f7f"},{"fixed":"f39018d26848aaa64f22e912599e0dfbcae504ff"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0.13.0"},{"fixed":"0.13.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ruby/uri","events":[{"introduced":"af8d9d6bb1a90da71f64a9c3f8eddd3626d44efb"},{"fixed":"e5074739c3f28e03a26f6a1daa2a051fdbc3e774"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.0.0"},{"fixed":"1.0.4"}]}}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.12.3","v0.12.4","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-61594.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/61xxx/CVE-2025-61594.json"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/ruby/uri"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ruby/uri/commit/20157e3e29b125ff41f1d9662e2e3b1d066f5902"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ruby/uri/commit/7e521b2da0833d964aab43019e735aea674e1c2c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ruby/uri/commit/d3116ca66a3b1c97dc7577f9d2d6e353f391cd6a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/uri/CVE-2025-61594.yml"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61594"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rubygems.org/gems/uri"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2025/10/07/uri-cve-2025-61594/"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-212"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/61xxx/CVE-2025-61594.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
