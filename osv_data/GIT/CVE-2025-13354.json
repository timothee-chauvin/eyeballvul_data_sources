{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-13354","published":"2025-12-03T14:15:46.930Z","modified":"2025-12-07T10:06:08.864159Z","details":"The Tag, Category, and Taxonomy Manager – AI Autotagger with OpenAI plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 3.40.1. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the \"taxopress_merge_terms_batch\" function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to merge or delete arbitrary taxonomy terms.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/taxopress/taxopress","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5eb2cee861ebd109152eea968aca0259c078c8b0"}]}],"versions":["2.4.3","2.4.4","2.4.6","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.5.4","2.5.5","2.5.6","2.5.7","3.0","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.4.1","3.0.4.2","3.0.5","3.0.5.1","3.0.5.2","3.0.6","3.0.6.1","3.0.7","3.0.7.1","3.0.7.2","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.10.0","3.10.1","3.10.2","3.11.0","3.11.1","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.4.0","3.4.1","3.4.2","3.4.3","3.4.4","3.4.5","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.5.2","3.5.3","3.6.0","3.6.1","3.6.2","3.6.3","3.6.4","3.6.5","3.6.6","3.6.7","3.7.0","3.7.1","3.7.2","3.7.3","3.7.4","3.8.0","3.9.0","v2.28.1","v3.12.0","v3.13.0","v3.20.0","v3.21.0","v3.21.1","v3.22.0","v3.23.0","v3.24.0","v3.24.1","v3.25.0","v3.25.1","v3.26.0","v3.27.0","v3.28.0","v3.28.1","v3.30.0","v3.31.0","v3.32.0","v3.33.0","v3.34.0","v3.35.1","v3.36.0","v3.37.0","v3.37.1","v3.37.2","v3.37.3","v3.37.4","v3.38.0","v3.40.0","v3.40.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-13354.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/05c1ee52-02c9-440b-9269-14ea8b73be45?source=cve"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/TaxoPress/TaxoPress/commit/5eb2cee861ebd109152eea968aca0259c078c8b0"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
