It is a heap-based buffer over-read in mg_mqtt_next_subscribe_topic. A specially crafted MQTT SUBSCRIBE packet can cause an arbitrary out-of-bounds memory read potentially resulting in information disclosure and denial of service. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted MQTT packet over the network to trigger this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"95afa323c0e7740151f661629616daebe2915b61"}]}],"versions":["3.2","3.3","3.4","3.5","3.6","3.7","3.8","4.0","4.1","5.0","5.1","5.2","5.3","5.4","5.5","5.5_20140120","5.6","6.0","6.1","6.10","6.11","6.12","6.13","6.2","6.3","6.4","6.5","6.6","6.7","6.8","6.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-18765.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/TiffanyBlue/PoCbyMyself/blob/master/mongoose6.13/mqtt/Cesanta%20Mongoose%20MQTT%20mg_mqtt_next_subscribe_topic%20heap%20buffer%20overflow.md"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://twitter.com/thracky/status/1059472674940993541"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
