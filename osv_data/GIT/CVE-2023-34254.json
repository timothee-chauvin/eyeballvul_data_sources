Prior to version 1.5, if glpi-agent is running remoteinventory task against an Unix platform with ssh command, an administrator user on the remote can manage to inject a command in a specific workflow the agent would run with the privileges it uses. In the case, the agent is running with administration privileges, a malicious user could gain high privileges on the computer glpi-agent is running on. A malicious user could also disclose all remote accesses the agent is configured with for remoteinventory task. This vulnerability has been patched in glpi-agent 1.5.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi-agent","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"688eccd0412c37c388aa4e7d32a8fecb164603b7"}]}],"versions":["1.0","1.0-beta1","1.1","1.2","1.3","1.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-34254.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi-agent/security/advisories/GHSA-39vc-hxgm-j465"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi-agent/blob/dd313ee0914becf74c0e48cb512765210043b478/Changes#L98"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-78"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
