{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-47879","published":"2024-10-24T20:17:55Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:44:03.544332Z","aliases":["GHSA-3jm4-c6qf-jrh3"],"summary":"OpenRefine's PreviewExpressionCommand, which is eval, lacks protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF)","details":"OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3, lack of cross-site request forgery protection on the `preview-expression` command means that visiting a malicious website could cause an attacker-controlled expression to be executed. The expression can contain arbitrary Clojure or Python code. The attacker must know a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row, and the attacker must convince the victim to open a malicious webpage. Version 3.8.3 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openrefine/openrefine","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d70d9114a8c021a233f0c13c73a0a7784276f2a4"}]}],"versions":["1.1","2.6-alpha.2","2.6-alpha1","2.6-beta.1","2.6-rc.2","2.7","2.7-rc.1","2.7-rc.2","2.8","3.0","3.0-beta","3.0-rc.1","3.1","3.1-beta","3.2","3.2-beta","3.3","3.3-beta","3.3-rc1","3.4-beta","3.5-beta1","3.7-beta2","3.8-beta.3","3.8-beta.4","3.8-beta1","3.8-beta2","3.8-beta5","3.8.0","3.8.1","3.8.2","v2.6-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47879.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["70741200116215552636185552063441350157","250578989153400506380281591621571840554","234825196224379482873151685641821868458","163240278076324717749431253028938753191"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2024-47879-463f1041","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/openrefine/openrefine/commit/d70d9114a8c021a233f0c13c73a0a7784276f2a4","target":{"file":"main/src/com/google/refine/RefineServlet.java"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-3jm4-c6qf-jrh3"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/090924ca923489b6c94397cf1f5df7f7f78f0126"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-352","CWE-94"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
