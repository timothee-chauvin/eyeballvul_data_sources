This vulnerability is capable of arbitrary file writes which can lead to local privilege escalation to the GruntJS user if a lower-privileged user has write access to both source and destination directories as the lower-privileged user can create a symlink to the GruntJS user's .bashrc file or replace /etc/shadow file if the GruntJS user is root.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"82d79b803798f2a5f19662df9e12bef977dfa189"}]}],"versions":["v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-1537.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/1xxx/CVE-2022-1537.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/commit/58016ffac5ed9338b63ecc2a63710f5027362bae"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://huntr.dev/bounties/0179c3e5-bc02-4fc9-8491-a1a319b51b4d"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00006.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1537"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"@huntrdev","cwe_ids":["CWE-367"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/1xxx/CVE-2022-1537.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
