{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-2962","published":"2022-09-13T20:15:09.640Z","modified":"2025-12-08T07:53:17.651140Z","related":["openSUSE-SU-2024:12393-1"],"details":"A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the Tulip device emulation in QEMU. When Tulip reads or writes to the rx/tx descriptor or copies the rx/tx frame, it doesn't check whether the destination address is its own MMIO address. This can cause the device to trigger MMIO handlers multiple times, possibly leading to a stack or heap overflow. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/qemu/qemu","events":[{"introduced":"b0ca999a43a22b38158a222233d3f5881648bb4f"}]}],"versions":["staging-mjt-test","v10.0.0","v10.0.0-rc0","v10.0.0-rc1","v10.0.0-rc2","v10.0.0-rc3","v10.0.0-rc4","v10.0.1","v10.0.2","v10.0.3","v10.0.4","v10.0.5","v10.0.6","v10.0.7","v10.1.0","v10.1.0-rc0","v10.1.0-rc1","v10.1.0-rc2","v10.1.0-rc3","v10.1.0-rc4","v10.1.1","v10.1.2","v10.1.3","v10.2.0-rc1","v10.2.0-rc2","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v5.0.0","v5.0.0-rc0","v5.0.0-rc1","v5.0.0-rc2","v5.0.0-rc3","v5.0.0-rc4","v5.0.1","v5.1.0","v5.1.0-rc0","v5.1.0-rc1","v5.1.0-rc2","v5.1.0-rc3","v5.2.0","v5.2.0-rc0","v5.2.0-rc1","v5.2.0-rc2","v5.2.0-rc3","v5.2.0-rc4","v6.0.0","v6.0.0-rc0","v6.0.0-rc1","v6.0.0-rc2","v6.0.0-rc3","v6.0.0-rc4","v6.0.0-rc5","v6.0.1","v6.1.0","v6.1.0-rc0","v6.1.0-rc1","v6.1.0-rc2","v6.1.0-rc3","v6.1.0-rc4","v6.1.1","v6.2.0","v6.2.0-rc0","v6.2.0-rc1","v6.2.0-rc3","v6.2.0-rc4","v7.0.0","v7.0.0-rc0","v7.0.0-rc1","v7.0.0-rc2","v7.0.0-rc3","v7.0.0-rc4","v7.1.0","v7.1.0-rc0","v7.1.0-rc1","v7.1.0-rc2","v7.1.0-rc3","v7.1.0-rc4","v7.2.0","v7.2.0-rc0","v7.2.0-rc1","v7.2.0-rc2","v7.2.0-rc3","v7.2.0-rc4","v7.2.1","v7.2.10","v7.2.11","v7.2.12","v7.2.13","v7.2.14","v7.2.15","v7.2.16","v7.2.17","v7.2.18","v7.2.19","v7.2.2","v7.2.20","v7.2.21","v7.2.22","v7.2.3","v7.2.4","v7.2.5","v7.2.6","v7.2.7","v7.2.8","v7.2.9","v8.0.0","v8.0.0-rc0","v8.0.0-rc1","v8.0.0-rc2","v8.0.0-rc3","v8.0.0-rc4","v8.0.1","v8.0.2","v8.0.3","v8.0.4","v8.0.5","v8.1.0","v8.1.0-rc0","v8.1.0-rc1","v8.1.0-rc2","v8.1.0-rc3","v8.1.0-rc4","v8.1.1","v8.1.2","v8.1.3","v8.1.4","v8.1.5","v8.2.0","v8.2.0-rc0","v8.2.0-rc1","v8.2.0-rc2","v8.2.0-rc3","v8.2.0-rc4","v8.2.1","v8.2.10","v8.2.2","v8.2.3","v8.2.4","v8.2.5","v8.2.6","v8.2.7","v8.2.8","v8.2.9","v9.0.0","v9.0.0-rc0","v9.0.0-rc1","v9.0.0-rc2","v9.0.0-rc3","v9.0.0-rc4","v9.0.1","v9.0.2","v9.0.3","v9.0.4","v9.1.0","v9.1.0-rc0","v9.1.0-rc1","v9.1.0-rc2","v9.1.0-rc3","v9.1.0-rc4","v9.1.1","v9.1.2","v9.1.3","v9.2.0","v9.2.0-rc0","v9.2.0-rc1","v9.2.0-rc2","v9.2.0-rc3","v9.2.1","v9.2.2","v9.2.3","v9.2.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-2962.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"36a894aeb64a2e02871016da1c37d4a4ca109182"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.11.0-rc0","v0.12.0-rc0","v0.13.0-rc0","v0.14.0-rc0","v0.15.0-rc0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.5.0","v1.0","v1.0-rc0","v1.0-rc1","v1.0-rc2","v1.0-rc3","v1.0-rc4","v1.1-rc0","v1.1-rc1","v1.1-rc2","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc2","v1.1.0-rc3","v1.1.0-rc4","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc0","v1.2.0-rc1","v1.2.0-rc2","v1.2.0-rc3","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-rc0","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.3.0-rc2","v1.4.0","v1.4.0-rc0","v1.4.0-rc1","v1.4.0-rc2","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-rc0","v1.5.0-rc1","v1.5.0-rc2","v1.5.0-rc3","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc0","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.6.0-rc2","v1.6.0-rc3","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.7.0-rc2","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-rc0","v2.0.0-rc1","v2.0.0-rc2","v2.0.0-rc3","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-rc0","v2.1.0-rc1","v2.1.0-rc2","v2.1.0-rc3","v2.1.0-rc4","v2.1.0-rc5","v2.10.0","v2.10.0-rc0","v2.10.0-rc1","v2.10.0-rc2","v2.10.0-rc3","v2.10.0-rc4","v2.11.0","v2.11.0-rc0","v2.11.0-rc1","v2.11.0-rc2","v2.11.0-rc3","v2.11.0-rc4","v2.11.0-rc5","v2.12.0","v2.12.0-rc0","v2.12.0-rc1","v2.12.0-rc2","v2.12.0-rc3","v2.12.0-rc4","v2.2.0","v2.2.0-rc0","v2.2.0-rc1","v2.2.0-rc2","v2.2.0-rc3","v2.2.0-rc4","v2.2.0-rc5","v2.3.0","v2.3.0-rc0","v2.3.0-rc1","v2.3.0-rc2","v2.3.0-rc3","v2.3.0-rc4","v2.4.0","v2.4.0-rc0","v2.4.0-rc1","v2.4.0-rc2","v2.4.0-rc3","v2.4.0-rc4","v2.5.0","v2.5.0-rc0","v2.5.0-rc1","v2.5.0-rc2","v2.5.0-rc3","v2.5.0-rc4","v2.6.0","v2.6.0-rc0","v2.6.0-rc1","v2.6.0-rc2","v2.6.0-rc3","v2.6.0-rc4","v2.6.0-rc5","v2.7.0","v2.7.0-rc0","v2.7.0-rc1","v2.7.0-rc2","v2.7.0-rc3","v2.7.0-rc4","v2.7.0-rc5","v2.8.0","v2.8.0-rc0","v2.8.0-rc1","v2.8.0-rc2","v2.8.0-rc3","v2.8.0-rc4","v2.9.0","v2.9.0-rc0","v2.9.0-rc1","v2.9.0-rc2","v2.9.0-rc3","v2.9.0-rc4","v2.9.0-rc5","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-rc0","v3.0.0-rc1","v3.0.0-rc2","v3.0.0-rc3","v3.0.0-rc4","v3.1.0","v3.1.0-rc0","v3.1.0-rc1","v3.1.0-rc2","v3.1.0-rc3","v3.1.0-rc4","v3.1.0-rc5","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-rc0","v4.0.0-rc1","v4.0.0-rc2","v4.0.0-rc3","v4.0.0-rc4","v4.1.0","v4.1.0-rc0","v4.1.0-rc1","v4.1.0-rc2","v4.1.0-rc3","v4.1.0-rc4","v4.1.0-rc5","v4.2.0","v4.2.0-rc0","v4.2.0-rc1","v4.2.0-rc2","v4.2.0-rc3","v4.2.0-rc4","v4.2.0-rc5","v5.0.0","v5.0.0-rc0","v5.0.0-rc1","v5.0.0-rc2","v5.0.0-rc3","v5.0.0-rc4","v5.1.0","v5.1.0-rc0","v5.1.0-rc1","v5.1.0-rc2","v5.1.0-rc3","v5.2.0","v5.2.0-rc0","v5.2.0-rc1","v5.2.0-rc2","v5.2.0-rc3","v5.2.0-rc4","v6.0.0","v6.0.0-rc0","v6.0.0-rc1","v6.0.0-rc2","v6.0.0-rc3","v6.0.0-rc4","v6.0.0-rc5","v6.1.0","v6.1.0-rc0","v6.1.0-rc1","v6.1.0-rc2","v6.1.0-rc3","v6.1.0-rc4","v6.2.0","v6.2.0-rc0","v6.2.0-rc1","v6.2.0-rc3","v6.2.0-rc4","v7.0.0","v7.0.0-rc0","v7.0.0-rc1","v7.0.0-rc2","v7.0.0-rc3","v7.0.0
