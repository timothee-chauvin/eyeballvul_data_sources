Prior to versions 5.0.157, 5.0-b1, and 6.0.48, SRS's `api-server` server is vulnerable to a drive-by command injection. An attacker may send a request to the `/api/v1/snapshots` endpoint containing any commands to be executed as part of the body of the POST request. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). Versions 5.0.157, 5.0-b1, and 6.0.48 contain a fix.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ossrs/srs","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f32c8c31c0966fc37f9689000dd5ed5426af1fc0"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v1.0-r0","v2.0-a0","v2.0-a1","v2.0-a2","v2.0-a3","v2.0-b0","v2.0-b1","v2.0-b2","v2.0-b3","v2.0-b4","v2.0-r0","v2.0-r1","v2.0-r2","v2.0-r3","v2.0-r4","v2.0-r5","v2.0-r6","v2.0-r7","v2.0-r8","v3.0-a0","v3.0-a1","v3.0-a2","v3.0-a3","v3.0-a4","v3.0-a5","v3.0-a6","v3.0-a7","v3.0-a8","v3.0-a9","v3.0-b0","v3.0-b1","v3.0-b2","v3.0-b3","v3.0-b4","v3.0-r0","v3.0-r1","v3.0-r2","v3.0-r3","v4.0-b0","v4.0-b1","v4.0-b10","v4.0-b2","v4.0-b3","v4.0-b5","v4.0-b6","v4.0-b7","v4.0-b8","v4.0-b9","v4.0-r0","v4.0-r1","v4.0-r2","v4.0-r3","v4.0-r4","v5.0-a0","v5.0-a1","v5.0-a2","v5.0-a3","v5.0-a4","v5.0-a5","v5.0-b0","v5.0-b1","v5.0-b2","v5.0-b3","v5.0-b4","v5.0-b5","v5.0-b6","v5.0-b7","v5.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-34105.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ossrs/srs/blob/1d11d02e4b82fc3f37e4b048cff483b1581482c1/trunk/research/api-server/server.go#L761"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ossrs/srs/commit/1d878c2daaf913ad01c6d0bc2f247116c8050338"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ossrs/srs/security/advisories/GHSA-vpr5-779c-cx62"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-78"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
