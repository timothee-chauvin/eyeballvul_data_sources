A vulnerability in OpenTelemetry.Api package 1.10.0 to 1.11.1 could cause a Denial of Service (DoS) when a tracestate and traceparent header is received. Even if an application does not explicitly use trace context propagation, receiving these headers can still trigger high CPU usage. This issue impacts any application accessible over the web or backend services that process HTTP requests containing a tracestate header. Application may experience excessive resource consumption, leading to increased latency, degraded performance, or downtime. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.11.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet","events":[{"introduced":"a5fa611774b6e63c2189cba7b5417a0d496df95c"},{"fixed":"7f2eb92952ab0e9b959adf20325e64fbfd6417cb"}]}],"versions":["core-1.11.0","core-1.11.0-rc.1","core-1.11.1","coreunstable-1.10.0-beta.1","coreunstable-1.11.0-beta.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27513.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/security/advisories/GHSA-8785-wc3w-h8q6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/commit/1b555c1201413f2f55f2cd3c4ba03ef4b615b6b5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
