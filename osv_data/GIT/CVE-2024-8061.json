This can lead to a denial of service, as the tracking server does not respond to other requests while waiting. The issue arises in the client used by the `aim` tracking server to communicate with external resources, specifically in the `_run_read_instructions` method and similar calls without timeouts.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"3b0813009938eed37cfd0d6b6c46b62112e8e294"}]}],"versions":["pre-launch","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.8","v1.0.0","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.7rc1","v2.1.6","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-beta5","v3.0.0-beta6","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.10.0","v3.10.1","v3.10.2","v3.10.3","v3.11.0","v3.11.1","v3.11.2","v3.12.0","v3.12.1","v3.12.2","v3.13.0","v3.13.1","v3.13.2","v3.13.3","v3.13.4","v3.14.0","v3.14.1","v3.14.2","v3.14.3","v3.14.4","v3.15.0","v3.15.1","v3.15.2","v3.16.0","v3.16.1","v3.16.2","v3.17.0","v3.17.1","v3.17.2","v3.17.3","v3.17.4","v3.17.5","v3.18.1","v3.19.0","v3.19.1","v3.19.2","v3.19.3","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.20.1","v3.21.0","v3.22.0","v3.23.0","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.3.4","v3.3.5","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.5.3","v3.5.4","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.6.2","v3.6.3","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.7.2","v3.7.3","v3.7.4","v3.7.5","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v3.9.2","v3.9.3","v3.9.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-8061.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/c85d005c-b354-4c51-a88f-adda2f09622b"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
