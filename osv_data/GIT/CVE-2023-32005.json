As a result, malicious actors can retrieve stats from files that they do not have explicit read access to.\n\nThis vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20.\n\nPlease note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nodejs/node","events":[{"introduced":"e7618fb5a5fc25d76b6474e2a6607f04fd6f10e0"},{"fixed":"9f51c55a47702dc6a0ca3569853dd7ba022bf7bb"}]}],"versions":["v20.0.0","v20.1.0","v20.2.0","v20.3.0","v20.3.1","v20.4.0","v20.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-32005.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/2051224"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231103-0004/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
