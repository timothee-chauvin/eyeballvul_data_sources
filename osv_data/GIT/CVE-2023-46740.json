Prior to version 3.3.1, CubeFS used an insecure random string generator to generate user-specific, sensitive keys used to authenticate users in a CubeFS deployment. This could allow an attacker to predict and/or guess the generated string and impersonate a user thereby obtaining higher privileges. When CubeFS creates new users, it creates a piece of sensitive information for the user called the “accessKey”. To create the \"accesKey\", CubeFS uses an insecure string generator which makes it easy to guess and thereby impersonate the created user. An attacker could leverage the predictable random string generator and guess a users access key and impersonate the user to obtain higher privileges. The issue has been fixed in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation than to upgrade.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"84795afb21a64e92db9e53fb88d33410ac3c49c0"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-rc.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-rc.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.3.0-rc.1","v2.4.0-rc.0","v2.5.0-rc.0","v3.0.0","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.2","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-46740.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/security/advisories/GHSA-4248-p65p-hcrm"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/commit/8555c6402794cabdf2cc025c8bea1576122c07ba"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-330"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
