{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-64752","published":"2025-11-13T21:43:57Z","modified":"2025-11-15T04:23:38.895552Z","aliases":["GHSA-qh95-2qv8-pqx3"],"summary":"grist-core has path to server-side requests via websocket","details":"grist-core is a spreadsheet hosting server. Prior to version 1.7.7, a user with access to any document on a Grist installation can use a feature for fetching from a URL that is executed on the server. The privileged network access of server-side requests could offer opportunities for attack escalation. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.7. The mitigation was to use the proxy for untrusted fetches intended for such purposes. As a workaround, avoid making http/https endpoints available to an instance running Grist that expose credentials or operate without credentials.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a553efc29d4af1182a9dd258b2264a3778ef10c0"}]}],"versions":["1.3.1","1.3.2","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.5","v0.7.6","v0.7.7","v0.7.8","v0.7.9","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.10","v1.1.11","v1.1.12","v1.1.13","v1.1.14","v1.1.15","v1.1.16","v1.1.17","v1.1.18","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.1.8","v1.1.9","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.7.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64752.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/releases/tag/v1.7.7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/security/advisories/GHSA-qh95-2qv8-pqx3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
