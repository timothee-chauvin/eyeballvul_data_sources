{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-27415","published":"2025-03-19T19:02:04.824Z","modified":"2025-12-05T08:53:44.474777Z","aliases":["GHSA-jvhm-gjrh-3h93"],"summary":"Nuxt allows DOS via cache poisoning with payload rendering response","details":"Nuxt is an open-source web development framework for Vue.js. Prior to 3.16.0, by sending a crafted HTTP request to a server behind an CDN, it is possible in some circumstances to poison the CDN cache and highly impacts the availability of a site. It is possible to craft a request, such as https://mysite.com/?/_payload.json which will be rendered as JSON. If the CDN in front of a Nuxt site ignores the query string when determining whether to cache a route, then this JSON response could be served to future visitors to the site. An attacker can perform this attack to a vulnerable site in order to make a site unavailable indefinitely. It is also possible in the case where the cache will be reset to make a small script to send a request each X seconds (=caching duration) so that the cache is permanently poisoned making the site completely unavailable. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.16.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt","events":[{"introduced":"d991a55ec36f5ac61de0af7d0b018a150153445b"},{"fixed":"7a37a982535f6da0cef16c4d7d3a81df42429ec1"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.0.0"},{"fixed":"3.16.0"}]}}],"versions":["3.1.1","@nuxt/ui-assets@0.1.0","@nuxt/ui-assets@0.2.0","@nuxt/ui-assets@0.2.1","@nuxt/ui-templates@0.1.0","@nuxt/ui-templates@0.1.1","@nuxt/ui-templates@0.2.0","@nuxt/ui-templates@0.2.1","@nuxt/ui-templates@0.2.2","@nuxt/ui-templates@0.3.0","@nuxt/ui-templates@0.3.1","@nuxt/ui-templates@0.3.2","@nuxt/ui-templates@0.3.3","@nuxt/ui-templates@0.4.0","@nuxt/ui-templates@1.1.0","@nuxt/ui-templates@1.1.1","@nuxt/ui-templates@1.2.0","@nuxt/ui-templates@1.2.1","@nuxt/ui-templates@1.3.0","@nuxt/ui-templates@1.3.1","@nuxt/ui-templates@1.3.2","@nuxt/ui-templates@1.3.3","@nuxt/ui@0.1.0","@nuxt/ui@0.1.1","@nuxt/ui@0.2.0","@nuxt/ui@0.3.0","@nuxt/ui@0.3.1","@nuxt/ui@0.3.2","@nuxt/ui@0.3.3","@nuxt/ui@0.4.0","@nuxt/ui@0.4.1","v3.0.0","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.2","v3.10.0","v3.10.1","v3.10.2","v3.10.3","v3.11.0","v3.11.1","v3.11.2","v3.12.0","v3.12.1","v3.12.2","v3.12.3","v3.12.4","v3.13.0","v3.13.1","v3.13.2","v3.14.0","v3.14.159","v3.14.1592","v3.15.0","v3.15.1","v3.15.2","v3.15.3","v3.15.4","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.2.3","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.4.2","v3.4.3","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.5.3","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.6.2","v3.6.3","v3.6.4","v3.6.5","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.7.2","v3.7.3","v3.7.4","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.8.2","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v3.9.2","v3.9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27415.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/27xxx/CVE-2025-27415.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/security/advisories/GHSA-jvhm-gjrh-3h93"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27415"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-349"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/27xxx/CVE-2025-27415.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
