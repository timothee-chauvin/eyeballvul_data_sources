The read-only password widget used by the Django Admin to display an obfuscated password hash was bypassed if a user has only the \"view\" permission (new in Django 2.1), resulting in display of the entire password hash to those users. This may result in a vulnerability for sites with legacy user accounts using insecure hashes.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/django/django","events":[{"introduced":"df591468251ed489a3e147d7c359f387f4effe66"},{"fixed":"38e2fdadfd9952e751deed662edf4c496d238f28"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-16984.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041749"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190502-0009/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2018/oct/01/security-release/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
