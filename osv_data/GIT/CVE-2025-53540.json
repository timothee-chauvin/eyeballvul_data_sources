Several OTA update examples and the HTTPUpdateServer implementation are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The update endpoints accept POST requests for firmware uploads without CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary firmware, resulting in remote code execution (RCE). This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ac961f671abd5ae1da0a15fd4bee71ed807c2cf3"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.0-RC0","1.0.0-rc1","1.0.0-rc2","1.0.0-rc3","1.0.0-rc4","1.0.1","1.0.1-rc1","1.0.1-rc2","1.0.1-rc3","1.0.1-rc4","1.0.2","1.0.2-rc1","1.0.2-rc2","1.0.3","1.0.3-rc1","1.0.3-rc2","1.0.3-rc3","1.0.4","1.0.4-rc1","1.0.5","1.0.5-rc1","1.0.5-rc2","1.0.5-rc3","1.0.5-rc4","1.0.5-rc5","1.0.5-rc6","1.0.5-rc7","1.0.6","2.0.0","2.0.0-alpha1","2.0.0-rc1","2.0.0-rc2","2.0.1","2.0.1-RC1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.3-RC1","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","3.0.0","3.0.0-alpha1","3.0.0-alpha2","3.0.0-alpha3","3.0.0-rc1","3.0.0-rc2","3.0.0-rc3","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.1.0","3.1.0-RC1","3.1.0-RC2","3.1.0-RC3","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.2.0","3.2.0-RC1","3.2.0-RC2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53540.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/security/advisories/GHSA-9vfw-wx65-c872"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/commit/f4fdecc60c465384e465a4b1d2bd1eac8f67912e"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-352"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
