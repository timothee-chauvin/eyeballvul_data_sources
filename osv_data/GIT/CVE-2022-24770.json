{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-24770","published":"2022-03-17T20:30:19Z","modified":"2025-11-19T10:56:40.160575Z","aliases":["GHSA-f8xq-q7px-wg8c","PYSEC-2022-229"],"summary":"Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File in Gradio Flagging","details":"`gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"80fea89117358ee105973453fdc402398ae20239"}]}],"versions":["v2.3.6","v2.4.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.1","v2.7.5","v2.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24770.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/80fea89117358ee105973453fdc402398ae20239"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/817"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-f8xq-q7px-wg8c"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1236"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
