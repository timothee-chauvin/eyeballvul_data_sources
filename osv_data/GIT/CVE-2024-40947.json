by\nima_filter_rule_match()\") introduced call to ima_lsm_copy_rule within a\nRCU read-side critical section which contains kmalloc with GFP_KERNEL.\nThis implies a possible sleep and violates limitations of RCU read-side\ncritical sections on non-PREEMPT systems.\n\nSleeping within RCU read-side critical section might cause\nsynchronize_rcu() returning early and break RCU protection, allowing a\nUAF to happen.\n\nThe root cause of this issue could be described as follows:\n|\tThread A\t|\tThread B\t|\n|\t\t\t|ima_match_policy\t|\n|\t\t\t|  rcu_read_lock\t|\n|ima_lsm_update_rule\t|\t\t\t|\n|  synchronize_rcu\t|\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t|    kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL)|\n|\t\t\t|      sleep\t\t|\n==> synchronize_rcu returns early\n|  kfree(entry)\t\t|\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t|    entry = entry->next|\n==> UAF happens and entry now becomes NULL (or could be anything).\n|\t\t\t|    entry->action\t|\n==> Accessing entry might cause panic.\n\nTo fix this issue, we are converting all kmalloc that is called within\nRCU read-side critical section to use GFP_ATOMIC.\n\n[PM: fixed missing comment, long lines, !CONFIG_IMA_LSM_RULES
