  "details": "If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL, it\nsets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a `CONNECT` request to\nthe proxy, and then *tunnels* the rest of protocol through.\n\nAn HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow\noutgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead\nreturn a non-200 response code to the client.\n\nDue to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double free\nin curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URL for the transfer:\n`dict`, `gopher`, `gophers`, `ldap`, `ldaps`, `rtmp`, `rtmps`, `telnet`",
