{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2018-6480","published":"2018-01-31T20:29:00.790Z","modified":"2025-11-20T10:51:55.126532Z","details":"A type confusion issue was discovered in CCN-lite 2, leading to a memory access violation and a failure of the nonce feature (which, for example, helped with loop prevention). ccnl_fwd_handleInterest assumes that the union member s is of type ccnl_pktdetail_ndntlv_s. However, if the type is in fact struct ccnl_pktdetail_ccntlv_s or struct ccnl_pktdetail_iottlv_s, the memory at that point is either uninitialised or points to data that is not a nonce, which renders the code using the local variable nonce pointless. A later nonce check is insufficient.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/ccn-lite","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"063fd8ad7e74f24410ef8fd9e23673c532500df5"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.3.0","0.3.1","2.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-6480.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/ccn-lite/issues/159"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
