In versions 2.9.8 to before 2.9.11, an empty XML tag can cause a segmentation fault. If SecParseXmlIntoArgs is set to On or OnlyArgs, and the request type is application/xml, and at least one XML tag is empty (eg <foo></foo>), then a segmentation fault occurs. This issue has been patched in version 2.9.11. A workaround involves setting SecParseXmlIntoArgs to Off.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/modsecurity","events":[{"introduced":"ad0161118d0ec36b1bd7537ef8f4d889d89c1c35"},{"fixed":"5615addfb3432d5b1af1849c5e78e11812a8fe03"}]}],"versions":["v2.9.10","v2.9.8","v2.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52891.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/security/advisories/GHSA-gw9c-4wfm-vj3x"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/commit/ecd7b9736836eee391d25f35d5bd06a3ce35a45d"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
