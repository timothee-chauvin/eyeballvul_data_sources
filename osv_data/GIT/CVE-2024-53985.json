The XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of Rails::HTML::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if HTML5 sanitization is enabled and the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed tags with both \"math\" and \"style\" elements or both both \"svg\" and \"style\" elements. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.1.",
