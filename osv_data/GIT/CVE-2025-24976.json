Systems running registry versions 3.0.0-beta.1 through 3.0.0-rc.2 with token authentication enabled may be vulnerable to an issue in which token authentication allows an attacker to inject an untrusted signing key in a JSON web token (JWT). The issue lies in how the JSON web key (JWK) verification is performed. When a JWT contains a JWK header without a certificate chain, the code only checks if the KeyID (`kid`) matches one of the trusted keys, but doesn't verify that the actual key material matches. A fix for the issue is available at commit 5ea9aa028db65ca5665f6af2c20ecf9dc34e5fcd and expected to be a part of version 3.0.0-rc.3. There is no way to work around this issue without patching if the system requires token authentication.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/distribution/distribution","events":[{"introduced":"c709432b917488208fa78a7932843d91eca59801"},{"fixed":"5ea9aa028db65ca5665f6af2c20ecf9dc34e5fcd"}]}],"versions":["v3.0.0-beta.1","v3.0.0-rc.1","v3.0.0-rc.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-24976.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/distribution/distribution/security/advisories/GHSA-phw4-mc57-4hwc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/distribution/distribution/commit/5ea9aa028db65ca5665f6af2c20ecf9dc34e5fcd"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-639"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
