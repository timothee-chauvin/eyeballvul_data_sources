The CNI 'portmap' plugin, used to setup HostPorts for CNI, inserts rules at the front of the iptables nat chains; which take precedence over the KUBE- SERVICES chain. Because of this, the HostPort/portmap rule could match incoming traffic even if there were better fitting, more specific service definition rules like NodePorts later in the chain. The issue is fixed in CNI 0.7.5 and Kubernetes 1.11.9, 1.12.7, 1.13.5, and 1.14.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"16236ce91790d4c75b79f6ce96841db1c843e7d2"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.13.1-dev","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.19.0","v0.19.1","v0.19.2","v0.19.3","v0.2","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.21.2","v0.3","v0.4","v0.5","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0-alpha.0","v1.1.0-alpha.1","v1.10.0-alpha.0","v1.10.0-alpha.1","v1.10.0-alpha.2","v1.10.0-alpha.3","v1.11.0","v1.11.0-alpha.0","v1.11.0-alpha.1","v1.11.0-alpha.2","v1.11.0-beta.0","v1.11.0-beta.1","v1.11.0-beta.2","v1.11.0-rc.1","v1.11.0-rc.2","v1.11.0-rc.3","v1.11.1","v1.11.1-beta.0","v1.11.2","v1.11.2-beta.0","v1.11.3","v1.11.3-beta.0","v1.11.4","v1.11.4-beta.0","v1.11.5","v1.11.5-beta.0","v1.11.6","v1.11.6-beta.0","v1.11.7","v1.11.7-beta.0","v1.11.8","v1.11.8-beta.0","v1.11.9-beta.0","v1.12.0-alpha.0","v1.2.0-alpha.1","v1.2.0-alpha.2","v1.2.0-alpha.3","v1.2.0-alpha.4","v1.2.0-alpha.5","v1.2.0-alpha.6","v1.2.0-alpha.7","v1.2.0-alpha.8","v1.3.0-alpha.0","v1.3.0-alpha.1","v1.3.0-alpha.2","v1.3.0-alpha.3","v1.3.0-alpha.4","v1.3.0-alpha.5","v1.4.0-alpha.0","v1.4.0-alpha.1","v1.4.0-alpha.2","v1.4.0-alpha.3","v1.5.0-alpha.0","v1.5.0-alpha.1","v1.5.0-alpha.2","v1.6.0-alpha.0","v1.6.0-alpha.1","v1.6.0-alpha.2","v1.6.0-alpha.3","v1.7.0-alpha.0","v1.7.0-alpha.1","v1.7.0-alpha.2","v1.7.0-alpha.3","v1.7.0-alpha.4","v1.8.0-alpha.0","v1.8.0-alpha.1","v1.8.0-alpha.2","v1.8.0-alpha.3","v1.9.0-alpha.0","v1.9.0-alpha.1","v1.9.0-alpha.2","v1.9.0-alpha.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-9946.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a62711a5da7a2dc2eb93eac47e103738ad923fd6"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.2.0-rc0","v0.3.0","v0.3.0-rc0","v0.3.0-rc1","v0.3.0-rc2","v0.3.0-rc3","v0.6.0","v0.6.0-rc1","v0.6.0-rc2","v0.7.0","v0.7.0-rc1","v0.7.0-rc2","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-9946.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubelet","events":[{"introduced":"b2c7df37e34be8581976ae5b6289401530620ff9"},{"fixed":"90bb74a031b8e57d819e417e2b33833058008b00"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-9946.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FCN66VYB3XS76SYH567SO7N3I254JOCT/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SGOOWAELGH3F7OXRBPH3HCNZELNLXYTW/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:0862"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/269#issuecomment-477683272"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190416-0002/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
