{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53198","published":"2025-09-15T14:06:47.761Z","modified":"2025-11-20T00:46:28.229608Z","summary":"raw: Fix NULL deref in raw_get_next().","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nraw: Fix NULL deref in raw_get_next().\n\nDae R. Jeong reported a NULL deref in raw_get_next() [0].\n\nIt seems that the repro was running these sequences in parallel so\nthat one thread was iterating on a socket that was being freed in\nanother netns.\n\n  unshare(0x40060200)\n  r0 = syz_open_procfs(0x0, &(0x7f0000002080)='net/raw\\x00')\n  socket$inet_icmp_raw(0x2, 0x3, 0x1)\n  pread64(r0, &(0x7f0000000000)=\"\"/10, 0xa, 0x10000000007f)\n\nAfter commit 0daf07e52709 (\"raw: convert raw sockets to RCU\"), we\nuse RCU and hlist_nulls_for_each_entry() to iterate over SOCK_RAW\nsockets.  However, we should use spinlock for slow paths to avoid\nthe NULL deref.\n\nAlso, SOCK_RAW does not use SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU, and the slab object\nis not reused during iteration in the grace period.  In fact, the\nlockless readers do not check the nulls marker with get_nulls_value().\nSo, SOCK_RAW should use hlist instead of hlist_nulls.\n\nInstead of adding an unnecessary barrier by sk_nulls_for_each_rcu(),\nlet's convert hlist_nulls to hlist and use sk_for_each_rcu() for\nfast paths and sk_for_each() and spinlock for /proc/net/raw.\n\n[0]:\ngeneral protection fault, probably for
