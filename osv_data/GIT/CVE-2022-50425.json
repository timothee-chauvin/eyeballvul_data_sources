Then retrieving them from init_fpstate will explode like this:\n\n BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\n ...\n RIP: 0010:memcpy_erms+0x6/0x10\n  ? __copy_xstate_to_uabi_buf+0x381/0x870\n  fpu_copy_guest_fpstate_to_uabi+0x28/0x80\n  kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl+0x14c/0x1460 [kvm]\n  ? __this_cpu_preempt_check+0x13/0x20\n  ? vmx_vcpu_put+0x2e/0x260 [kvm_intel]\n  kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0xea/0x6b0 [kvm]\n  ? kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0xea/0x6b0 [kvm]\n  ? __fget_light+0xd4/0x130\n  __x64_sys_ioctl+0xe3/0x910\n  ? debug_smp_processor_id+0x17/0x20\n  ? fpregs_assert_state_consistent+0x27/0x50\n  do_syscall_64+0x3f/0x90\n  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd\n\nAdjust the 'mask' to zero out the userspace buffer for the features that\nare not available both from fpstate and from init_fpstate.\n\nThe dynamic features depend on the compacted XSAVE format.
