The server or client could crash when the connection hasn't been fully initialized and the system tries to cleanup the ciphers when closing the connection. The biggest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.com/libssh/libssh-mirror","events":[{"introduced":"d66ea0b3b100664916cbab965e79a870e31ac7fe"},{"fixed":"04685a74df9ce1db1bc116a83a0da78b4f4fa1f8"}]}],"versions":["libssh-0.8.0","libssh-0.8.1","libssh-0.8.2","libssh-0.8.3","libssh-0.8.4","libssh-0.8.5","libssh-0.8.6","libssh-0.8.7","libssh-0.8.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-1730.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-1730"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200424-0001/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4327-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2020-1730.txt"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2A7BIFKUYIYKTY7FX4BEWVC2OHS5DPOU/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VLSWHBQ3EPKGTGLQNH554Z746BJ3C554/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
