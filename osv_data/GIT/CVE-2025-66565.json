{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-66565","published":"2025-12-09T01:47:58.430Z","modified":"2025-12-13T04:56:07.354327Z","aliases":["GHSA-m98w-cqp3-qcqr"],"summary":"Fiber Utils UUIDv4 and UUID Silent Fallback to Predictable Values","details":"Fiber Utils is a collection of common functions created for Fiber. In versions 2.0.0-rc.3 and below, when the system's cryptographic random number generator (crypto/rand) fails, both functions silently fall back to returning predictable UUID values, including the zero UUID \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\". The vulnerability occurs through two related but distinct failure paths, both ultimately caused by crypto/rand.Read() failures, compromising the security of all Fiber applications using these functions for security-critical operations. This issue is fixed in version 2.0.0-rc.4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gofiber/utils","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6c6cf047032b9c8dff43d29f990b4b10e9b02d47"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.10","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9","v0.1","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-beta.1","v1.0.0-beta.2","v1.0.1","v2.0.0-beta.1","v2.0.0-beta.10","v2.0.0-beta.11","v2.0.0-beta.12","v2.0.0-beta.13","v2.0.0-beta.14","v2.0.0-beta.2","v2.0.0-beta.3","v2.0.0-beta.4","v2.0.0-beta.5","v2.0.0-beta.6","v2.0.0-beta.7","v2.0.0-beta.8","v2.0.0-beta.9","v2.0.0-rc.1","v2.0.0-rc.2","v2.0.0-rc.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66565.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66565.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/gofiber/utils/commit/6c6cf047032b9c8dff43d29f990b4b10e9b02d47"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/gofiber/utils/security/advisories/GHSA-m98w-cqp3-qcqr"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66565"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-252","CWE-331","CWE-338"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66565.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
