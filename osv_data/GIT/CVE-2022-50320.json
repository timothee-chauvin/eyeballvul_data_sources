acpi_os_map_memory() on invalid phys address\n\nOn a Packard Bell Dot SC (Intel Atom N2600 model) there is a FPDT table\nwhich contains invalid physical addresses, with high bits set which fall\noutside the range of the CPU-s supported physical address range.\n\nCalling acpi_os_map_memory() on such an invalid phys address leads to\nthe below WARN_ON in ioremap triggering resulting in an oops/stacktrace.\n\nAdd code to verify the physical address before calling acpi_os_map_memory()\nto fix / avoid the oops.\n\n[    1.226900] ioremap: invalid physical address 3001000000000000\n[
