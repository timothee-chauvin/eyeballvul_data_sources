{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-43797","published":"2024-09-02T16:21:07.372Z","modified":"2025-12-05T05:59:30.252065Z","aliases":["GHSA-gg56-vj58-g5mc"],"summary":"Path Traversal in audiobookshelf","details":"audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. A non-admin user is not allowed to create libraries (or access only the ones they have permission to). However, the `LibraryController` is missing the check for admin user and thus allows a path traversal issue. Allowing non-admin users to write to any directory in the system can be seen as a form of path traversal. However, since it can be restricted to only admin permissions, fixing this is relatively simple and falls more into the realm of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This issue has been addressed in release version 2.13.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5b22d7430a4cce20185147caeb13f77325b48824"}]}],"versions":["0.9.61-beta","0.9.61-beta.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.10","v1.1.11","v1.1.12","v1.1.13","v1.1.14","v1.1.15","v1.1.8","v1.1.9","v1.2.1","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.8","v1.3.1","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.11","v1.4.2","v1.4.4","v1.4.6","v1.4.7","v1.4.9","v1.5.0","v1.5.5","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v2.0.1","v2.0.10","v2.0.11","v2.0.12","v2.0.13","v2.0.14","v2.0.15","v2.0.16","v2.0.17","v2.0.18","v2.0.19","v2.0.2","v2.0.20","v2.0.21","v2.0.22","v2.0.23","v2.0.24","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.0.9","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.11.0","v2.12.0","v2.12.1","v2.12.2","v2.12.3","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.10","v2.2.11","v2.2.12","v2.2.13","v2.2.14","v2.2.15","v2.2.16","v2.2.17","v2.2.18","v2.2.19","v2.2.2","v2.2.20","v2.2.21","v2.2.22","v2.2.23","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.2.5","v2.2.6","v2.2.7","v2.2.8","v2.2.9","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.7.2","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-43797.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/43xxx/CVE-2024-43797.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf-ghsa-gg56-vj58-g5mc/pull/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/blob/1c0d6e9c670ebb1b6f1e427a4c4d9250a7fb9b80/server/controllers/LibraryController.js#L43-L47"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/security/advisories/GHSA-gg56-vj58-g5mc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43797"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/43xxx/CVE-2024-43797.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
