{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2019-13115","published":"2019-07-16T18:15:13.287Z","modified":"2025-11-20T10:56:12.784997Z","details":"In libssh2 before 1.9.0, kex_method_diffie_hellman_group_exchange_sha256_key_exchange in kex.c has an integer overflow that could lead to an out-of-bounds read in the way packets are read from the server. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service condition on the client system when a user connects to the server. This is related to an _libssh2_check_length mistake, and is different from the various issues fixed in 1.8.1, such as CVE-2019-3855.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"42d37aa63129a1b2644bf6495198923534322d64"}]}],"versions":["RELEASE.0.1","RELEASE.0.10","RELEASE.0.11","RELEASE.0.12","RELEASE.0.13","RELEASE.0.14","RELEASE.0.15","RELEASE.0.16","RELEASE.0.17","RELEASE.0.18","RELEASE.0.3","RELEASE.0.5","RELEASE.0.6","RELEASE.0.7","RELEASE.0.8","RELEASE.1.0","RELEASE.1.1","beforenb-0.14","beforenb2-0.14","libssh2-1.2","libssh2-1.2.1","libssh2-1.2.2","libssh2-1.2.3","libssh2-1.2.4","libssh2-1.2.5","libssh2-1.2.6","libssh2-1.2.7","libssh2-1.2.8","libssh2-1.2.9","libssh2-1.3.0","libssh2-1.4.0","libssh2-1.4.1","libssh2-1.4.2","libssh2-1.4.3","libssh2-1.5.0","libssh2-1.6.0","libssh2-1.7.0","libssh2-1.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-13115.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172834/libssh2-1.8.2-Out-Of-Bounds-Read.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r58af02e294bd07f487e2c64ffc0a29b837db5600e33b6e698b9d696b%40%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf4c02775860db415b4955778a131c2795223f61cb8c6a450893651e4%40%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00006.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6LUNHPW64IGCASZ4JQ2J5KDXNZN53DWW/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M7IF3LNHOA75O4WZWIHJLIRMA5LJUED3/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13322484?utm_source=f5support&amp%3Butm_medium=RSS"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://blog.semmle.com/libssh2-integer-overflow/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/compare/02ecf17...42d37aa"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/pull/350"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://libssh2.org/changes.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/07/msg00024.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00013.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190806-0002/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13322484"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
