Versions through abd including 0.1.30 have a vulnerability where the pr.yml GitHub Action interpolates in an unsafe manner untrusted input, specifically the github.event.pull_request.head.repo.clone_url and github.head_ref, to a command in the runner. Due to the action using the pull_request_target trigger it has permissive permissions by default. An unauthorized attacker can exploit this vulnerability to push arbitrary data to the repository. The subsequent impact on the end-user is executing the attackers' code when running serverless-dns. This is fixed in commit c5537dd, and expected to be released in 0.1.31.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d56ad0bd841599f42e28764937ca69462f40200a"}]}],"versions":["list","show","v0.1","v0.1.1","v0.1.10","v0.1.11","v0.1.12","v0.1.13","v0.1.14","v0.1.15","v0.1.16","v0.1.17","v0.1.18","v0.1.19","v0.1.2","v0.1.20","v0.1.21","v0.1.22","v0.1.23","v0.1.24","v0.1.25","v0.1.3","v0.1.30","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.1.9","v1.4.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-61584.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/security/advisories/GHSA-9g7x-737f-5xpc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/commit/c5537dd7f203c59f2b86d1e295c2371f3533946a"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-77"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:P"}]}
