{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2018-10362","published":"2018-04-25T05:29:00Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:36:44Z","details":"An issue was discovered in phpLiteAdmin 1.9.5 through 1.9.7.1. Due to loose comparison with '==' instead of '===' in classes/Authorization.php for the user-provided login password, it is possible to login with a simpler password if the password has the form of a power in scientific notation (like '2e2' for '200' or '0e1234' for '0'). This is possible because, in the loose comparison case, PHP interprets the string as a number in scientific notation, and thus converts it to a number. After that, the comparison with '==' casts the user input (e.g., the string '200' or '0') to a number, too. Hence the attacker can login with just a '0' or a simple number he has to brute force. Strong comparison with '===' prevents the cast into numbers.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/phpliteadmin/pla","events":[{"introduced":"af32e0ef085d6b0651e1e66f8d7385fd8c5a6662"},{"last_affected":"afc27e7338748ef032caa0b1fa4028ec14b26fd6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-10362.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://k3research.outerhaven.de/posts/small-mistakes-lead-to-big-problems.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/phpLiteAdmin/pla/issues/11"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
