At this point, since drvdata is not\nyet set and the driver's runtime PM callbacks rely on it, a crash can\noccur. To avoid this, set drvdata just after it was allocated.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"89ee8174e8c8db0efc75b26f2307114b38d61354"},{"fixed":"e7ce902db071a7b3e696a43d6e14ca57360deee6"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"89ee8174e8c8db0efc75b26f2307114b38d61354"},{"fixed":"c69e13965f26b8058f538ea8bdbd2d7718cf1fbe"}]}],"versions":["v6.13","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.16.1","v6.16.2","v6.16.3","v6.17-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39774.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.14.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39774.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c69e13965f26b8058f538ea8bdbd2d7718cf1fbe"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e7ce902db071a7b3e696a43d6e14ca57360deee6"}]}
