{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-23609","published":"2023-01-25T06:15:34.128Z","modified":"2025-11-19T19:46:38.136827Z","aliases":["GHSA-qr4q-6h3m-h3g7"],"summary":"contiki-ng BLE-L2CAP contains Improper size validation of L2CAP frames","details":"Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. Versions prior to and including 4.8 are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write that can occur in the BLE-L2CAP module. The Bluetooth Low Energy - Logical Link Control and Adaptation Layer Protocol (BLE-L2CAP) module handles fragmentation of packets up the configured MTU size. When fragments are reassembled, they are stored in a packet buffer of a configurable size, but there is no check to verify that the packet buffer is large enough to hold the reassembled packet. In Contiki-NG's default configuration, it is possible that an out-of-bounds write of up to 1152 bytes occurs. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2254 prior to the release of version 4.9.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"9771e9aaebbfbb5633ce69eb9876e0fc70bbcd6f"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"4.8"}]}}],"versions":["2.0","2.1","2.2","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.3","2.4","2.5-release","2.6","2.6-rc0","3.x","develop/v3.x-fork","develop/v4.0","develop/v4.1","develop/v4.2","develop/v4.3","develop/v4.4","develop/v4.5","develop/v4.6","develop/v4.7","develop/v4.8","fork","old/v2.0","old/v2.1","old/v2.2","old/v2.2.1","old/v2.2.2","old/v2.2.3","old/v2.3","old/v2.4","old/v2.6","release/v4.0","release/v4.1","release/v4.2","release/v4.3","release/v4.4","release/v4.5","release/v4.6","release/v4.7","release/v4.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-23609.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2254"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-qr4q-6h3m-h3g7"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-787"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:L"}]}
