{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-23331","published":"2024-01-19T19:43:17Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:40:08.293832Z","aliases":["GHSA-c24v-8rfc-w8vw"],"related":["CGA-2838-8gg9-p93q","openSUSE-SU-2025:14663-1"],"summary":"Vite dev server option `server.fs.deny` can be bypassed when hosted on case-insensitive filesystem","details":"Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. The Vite dev server option `server.fs.deny` can be bypassed on case-insensitive file systems using case-augmented versions of filenames. Notably this affects servers hosted on Windows. This bypass is similar to CVE-2023-34092 -- with surface area reduced to hosts having case-insensitive filesystems. Since `picomatch` defaults to case-sensitive glob matching, but the file server doesn't discriminate; a blacklist bypass is possible. By requesting raw filesystem paths using augmented casing, the matcher derived from `config.server.fs.deny` fails to block access to sensitive files. This issue has been addressed in vite@5.0.12, vite@4.5.2, vite@3.2.8, and vite@2.9.17. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should restrict access to dev servers.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite","events":[{"introduced":"075128a8dd0a2680540179dad2277a797f793199"},{"fixed":"3441f120fbd44b9c408706840647b4c8248b48fb"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite","events":[{"introduced":"b8c625cec4db938032ad754c7095bd246a4698ee"},{"fixed":"7e3a86638e1585702e7fb8eaf8ede43740a6a44e"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite","events":[{"introduced":"566d4c7bb51cf56550a5374ee46e1e1cbea1cf1f"},{"fixed":"d0360c12476ccc61e9e78c500ed1bd74ed65a2cf"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite","events":[{"introduced":"0c3125833033fec4356ab4e90e806e02e8644c40"},{"fixed":"ee81e196769c102a6b1bf30f8444ccde236e71d5"}]}],"versions":["create-vite@4.0.0","create-vite@4.1.0","create-vite@4.1.0-beta.0","create-vite@4.2.0","create-vite@4.2.0-beta.0","create-vite@4.2.0-beta.1","create-vite@4.3.0","create-vite@4.3.0-beta.0","create-vite@4.3.1","create-vite@4.3.2","create-vite@4.4.0","create-vite@4.4.1","create-vite@5.0.0","create-vite@5.1.0","plugin-legacy@3.0.0","plugin-legacy@3.0.1","plugin-legacy@4.0.0","plugin-legacy@4.0.1","plugin-legacy@4.0.2","plugin-legacy@4.0.3","plugin-legacy@4.0.4","plugin-legacy@4.0.5","plugin-legacy@4.1.0","plugin-legacy@4.1.1","plugin-legacy@5.0.0","plugin-legacy@5.1.0","plugin-legacy@5.2.0","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.1.0","v4.1.0-beta.0","v4.1.0-beta.1","v4.1.0-beta.2","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.1.3","v4.1.4","v4.2.0","v4.2.0-beta.0","v4.2.0-beta.1","v4.2.0-beta.2","v4.2.1","v4.3.0","v4.3.0-beta.0","v4.3.0-beta.1","v4.3.0-beta.2","v4.3.0-beta.3","v4.3.0-beta.4","v4.3.0-beta.5","v4.3.0-beta.6","v4.3.0-beta.7","v4.3.0-beta.8","v4.3.1","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v4.3.4","v4.3.5","v4.3.6","v4.3.7","v4.3.8","v4.3.9","v4.4.0","v4.4.0-beta.0","v4.4.0-beta.1","v4.4.0-beta.2","v4.4.0-beta.3","v4.4.0-beta.4","v4.4.1","v4.4.10","v4.4.11","v4.4.2","v4.4.3","v4.4.4","v4.4.5","v4.4.6","v4.4.7","v4.4.8","v4.4.9","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v5.0.0","v5.0.1","v5.0.10","v5.0.11","v5.0.2","v5.0.3","v5.0.4","v5.0.5","v5.0.6","v5.0.7","v5.0.8","v5.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-23331.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-c24v-8rfc-w8vw"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/91641c4da0a011d4c5352e88fc68389d4e1289a5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-fs-deny"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-178","CWE-200","CWE-284"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
