{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-46833","published":"2025-05-08T19:27:33Z","modified":"2025-11-04T19:33:07Z","aliases":["GHSA-5h26-2c6g-4ch4"],"summary":"Programs/P73_SimplePythonEncryption.py has weak cryptographic key","details":"Programs/P73_SimplePythonEncryption.py illustrates a simple Python encryption example using the RSA Algorithm. In versions prior to commit 6ce60b1, an attacker may be able to decrypt the data using brute force attacks and because of this the whole application can be impacted. This issue has been patched in commit 6ce60b1. A workaround involves increasing the key size, for RSA or DSA this is at least 2048 bits, for ECC this is at least 256 bits.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/shashikantsingh09/python-progrrames","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6ce60b1b2116a579a2e89de96d738a98f6ad4f27"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-46833.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ShashikantSingh09/python-progrrames/commit/6ce60b1b2116a579a2e89de96d738a98f6ad4f27"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ShashikantSingh09/python-progrrames/security/advisories/GHSA-5h26-2c6g-4ch4"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-326"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
