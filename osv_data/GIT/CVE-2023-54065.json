{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-54065","published":"2025-12-24T12:23:10.745Z","modified":"2025-12-24T20:48:13.813870Z","summary":"net: dsa: realtek: fix out-of-bounds access","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: realtek: fix out-of-bounds access\n\nThe probe function sets priv->chip_data to (void *)priv + sizeof(*priv)\nwith the expectation that priv has enough trailing space.\n\nHowever, only realtek-smi actually allocated this chip_data space.\nDo likewise in realtek-mdio to fix out-of-bounds accesses.\n\nThese accesses likely went unnoticed so far, because of an (unused)\nbuf[4096] member in struct realtek_priv, which caused kmalloc to\nround up the allocated buffer to a big enough size, so nothing of\nvalue was overwritten. With a different allocator (like in the barebox\nbootloader port of the driver) or with KASAN, the memory corruption\nbecomes quickly apparent.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"aac94001067da183455d6d37959892744fa01d9d"},{"fixed":"cc0f9bb99735d2b68fac68f37b585d615728ce5b"},{"fixed":"fe668aa499b4b95425044ba11af9609db6ecf466"},{"fixed":"b93eb564869321d0dffaf23fcc5c88112ed62466"}]}],"versions":["v5.17","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4","v6.2.5","v6.2.6","v6.2.7","v6.2.8","v6.2.9","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54065.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.23"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54065.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b93eb564869321d0dffaf23fcc5c88112ed62466"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cc0f9bb99735d2b68fac68f37b585d615728ce5b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fe668aa499b4b95425044ba11af9609db6ecf466"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54065.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54065"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54065.json"}}
