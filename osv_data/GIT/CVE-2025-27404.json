A vulnerability in versions prior to 2.11.5 and 2.12.13 allows an attacker to craft a URL that, once visited by any user, allows to embed arbitrary Javascript into Icinga Web and to act on behalf of that user. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.11.5 and 2.12.3 of Icinga Web 2. As a workaround, those who have Icinga Web 2.12.2 may enable a content security policy in the application settings.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/icinga/icingaweb2","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a5b152f467f0da542943765e2c644b80a2b356bd"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.5"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/icinga/icingaweb2","events":[{"introduced":"7cd79a5c7ff66a6a67ecd55875c214ba4b2c7db4"},{"fixed":"15e74ebb0ce4c41a341a406dd7c701bc5c85d826"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.12.0"},{"fixed":"2.12.3"}]}}],"versions":["v1.0-11","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-beta1","v2.0.0-beta2","v2.0.0-beta3","v2.0.0-rc1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.11.1","v2.11.2","v2.11.3","v2.11.4","v2.12.0","v2.12.1","v2.12.2","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.4.0","v2.4.0-2","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v2.5.3","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.8.0","v2.8.0-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27404.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/security/advisories/GHSA-c6pg-h955-wf66"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/releases/tag/v2.11.5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/releases/tag/v2.12.3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
