{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-29018","published":"2023-04-14T18:47:03.747Z","modified":"2025-12-04T23:47:10.373256Z","aliases":["GHSA-cwf6-xj49-wp83","GO-2023-1721"],"summary":" OpenFeature Operator vulnerable to Cluster-level Privilege Escalation","details":"The OpenFeature Operator allows users to expose feature flags to applications. Assuming the pre-existence of a vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution, an attacker could leverage the lax permissions configured on `open-feature-operator-controller-manager` to escalate the privileges of any SA in the cluster. The increased privileges could be used to modify cluster state, leading to DoS, or read sensitive data, including secrets. Version 0.2.32 mitigates this issue by restricting the resources the `open-feature-operator-controller-manager` can modify.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/open-feature/open-feature-operator","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e0d639a4f4261f68bedf507fd492a8fff11c4dc2"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.10","v0.2.11","v0.2.12","v0.2.13","v0.2.14","v0.2.15","v0.2.16","v0.2.17","v0.2.18","v0.2.19","v0.2.2","v0.2.20","v0.2.21","v0.2.22","v0.2.23","v0.2.24","v0.2.25","v0.2.26","v0.2.27","v0.2.28","v0.2.29","v0.2.3","v0.2.30","v0.2.31","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.8","v0.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-29018.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/29xxx/CVE-2023-29018.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/open-feature/open-feature-operator/releases/tag/v0.2.32"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/open-feature/open-feature-operator/security/advisories/GHSA-cwf6-xj49-wp83"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29018"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-269"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/29xxx/CVE-2023-29018.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
