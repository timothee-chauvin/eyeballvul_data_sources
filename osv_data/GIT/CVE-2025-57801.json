In versions prior to 0.14.0, the Verify function in eddsa.go and ecdsa.go used the S value from a signature without asserting that 0 ≤ S < order, leading to a signature malleability vulnerability. Because gnark’s native EdDSA and ECDSA circuits lack essential constraints, multiple distinct witnesses can satisfy the same public inputs. In protocols where nullifiers or anti-replay checks are derived from R and S, this enables signature malleability and may allow double spending. This issue has been addressed in version 0.14.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/consensys/gnark","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"97c089202ab64e0c63334e3f8f82d5f04027d65b"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0-alpha","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.2.0-alpha","v0.2.1-alpha","v0.3.0","v0.3.0-alpha","v0.3.1","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.3.8","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.9.0","v0.9.0-alpha","v0.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-57801.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/security/advisories/GHSA-95v9-hv42-pwrj"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/commit/0ba6730f05537a351517998add89a61a0d82716e"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-347"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
