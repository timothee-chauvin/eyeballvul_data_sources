When algorithms is not specified in the configuration, with the combination of jwks-rsa, it may lead to authorization bypass. You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply: - You are using express-jwt - You do not have **algorithms** configured in your express-jwt configuration. - You are using libraries such as jwks-rsa as the **secret**. You can fix this by specifying **algorithms** in the express-jwt configuration. See linked GHSA for example. This is also fixed in version 6.0.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7ecab5f8f0cab5297c2b863596566eb0c019cdef"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.3","v0.2.3","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v3.3.0","v3.4.0","v5.0.0","v5.1.0","v5.2.0","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.3.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-15084.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt/commit/7ecab5f8f0cab5297c2b863596566eb0c019cdef"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt/security/advisories/GHSA-6g6m-m6h5-w9gf"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
