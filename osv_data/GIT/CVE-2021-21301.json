In Wire for iOS (iPhone and iPad) before version 3.75 there is a vulnerability where the video capture isn't stopped in a scenario where a user first has their camera enabled and then disables it. It's a privacy issue because video is streamed to the call when the user believes it is disabled. It impacts all users in video calls. This is fixed in version 3.75.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7e3c30120066c9b10e50cc0d20012d0849c33a40"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-21301.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/commit/7e3c30120066c9b10e50cc0d20012d0849c33a40"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/pull/4879"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/security/advisories/GHSA-7fg4-x8vj-qvxf"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
