Prior to version 1.2.0, a memory leak can be triggered when parsing usernames which can trigger a denial-of-service. The domain portion of a username may be overridden causing an allocated memory area the size of the domain name to be leaked. An attacker can leak memory via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point, potentially causing a denial-of-service. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.0.\n\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3c3077e2a24b47db1b4c459fb3173ba7f75b9b44"}]}],"versions":["0.8.0","v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-25566.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/8660fb16474054e692a596e9c79670cd4d3954f4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/releases/tag/v1.2.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-mfm4-6g58-jw74"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-401"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
