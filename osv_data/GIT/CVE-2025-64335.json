In versions from 8.0.0 to before 8.0.2, a NULL dereference can occur when the entropy keyword is used in conjunction with base64_data. This issue has been patched in version 8.0.2. A workaround involves disabling rules that use entropy in conjunction with base64_data.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata","events":[{"introduced":"9956286fb89f9cad9e9f95b99dc751f8666617b7"},{"fixed":"79db7b1ad444c76530c6eac8702c5e01b7c24a56"}]}],"versions":["suricata-8.0.0","suricata-8.0.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64335.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/c935f08cd988600fd0a4f828a585b181dd5de012"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-v299-h7p3-q4f2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
