The relocation process requires starting and committing\na transaction, and if we have a failure in the critical section of the\ntransaction commit path (transaction state >= TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START),\nwe will deadlock if there is a paused scrub.\n\nThat results in stack traces like the following:\n\n  [42.479] BTRFS info (device sdc): relocating block group 53876686848
