Turns out the compression path will complete\nthe bio we use if we set up any of the compression bios and then return\nan error, and then btrfs_submit_data_bio() will also call bio_endio() on\nthe bio.\n\nFix this by making btrfs_submit_compressed_read() responsible for\ncalling bio_endio() on the bio if there are any errors.  Currently it\nwas only doing it if we created the compression bios, otherwise it was\ndepending on btrfs_submit_data_bio() to do the right thing.  This\ncreates the above problem, so fix up btrfs_submit_compressed_read() to\nalways call bio_endio() in case of an error, and then simply return from\nbtrfs_submit_data_bio() if we had to call\nbtrfs_submit_compressed_read().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"86ccbb4d2a2af4109430df518c995a4f7d14dfd2"},{"fixed":"4a4ceb2b990771c374d85d496a1a45255dde48e3"},{"fixed":"987b5df1d10355d377315a26e7fb6c72ded83c9f"},{"fixed":"f9f15de85d74e7eef021af059ca53a15f041cdd8"}]}],"versions":["v5.15","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.16.1","v5.16.10","v5.16.11","v5.16.12","v5.16.13","v5.16.14","v5.16.15","v5.16.16","v5.16.17","v5.16.18","v5.16.2","v5.16.3","v5.16.4","v5.16.5","v5.16.6","v5.16.7","v5.16.8","v5.16.9","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.17.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49167.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.16.19"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"5.17.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49167.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4a4ceb2b990771c374d85d496a1a45255dde48e3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/987b5df1d10355d377315a26e7fb6c72ded83c9f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f9f15de85d74e7eef021af059ca53a15f041cdd8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49167.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49167"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49167.json"}}
