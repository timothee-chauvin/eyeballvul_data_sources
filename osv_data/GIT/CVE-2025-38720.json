{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-38720","published":"2025-09-04T15:33:14.057Z","modified":"2025-12-05T09:52:27.991759Z","summary":"net: hibmcge: fix rtnl deadlock issue","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: hibmcge: fix rtnl deadlock issue\n\nCurrently, the hibmcge netdev acquires the rtnl_lock in\npci_error_handlers.reset_prepare() and releases it in\npci_error_handlers.reset_done().\n\nHowever, in the PCI framework:\npci_reset_bus - __pci_reset_slot - pci_slot_save_and_disable_locked -\n pci_dev_save_and_disable - err_handler->reset_prepare(dev);\n\nIn pci_slot_save_and_disable_locked():\n\tlist_for_each_entry(dev, &slot->bus->devices, bus_list) {\n\t\tif (!dev->slot || dev->slot!= slot)\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\tpci_dev_save_and_disable(dev);\n\t\tif (dev->subordinate)\n\t\t\tpci_bus_save_and_disable_locked(dev->subordinate);\n\t}\n\nThis will iterate through all devices under the current bus and execute\nerr_handler->reset_prepare(), causing two devices of the hibmcge driver\nto sequentially request the rtnl_lock, leading to a deadlock.\n\nSince the driver now executes netif_device_detach()\nbefore the reset process, it will not concurrently with\nother netdev APIs, so there is no need to hold the rtnl_lock now.\n\nTherefore, this patch removes the rtnl_lock during the reset process and\nadjusts the position of HBG_NIC_STATE_RESETTING to ensure\nthat multiple resets are not executed concurrently.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"3f5a61f6d504f55ed1a36cce044d5123d508721f"},{"fixed":"d85a6346fd6f595c4914205762d0cdf35c004a5e"},{"fixed":"1343a8994ca7dba78f5dd818e89d68331c21c35d"},{"fixed":"c875503a9b9082928d7d3fc60b5400d16fbfae4e"}]}],"versions":["v6.13","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.15.1","v6.15.10","v6.15.2","v6.15.3","v6.15.4","v6.15.5","v6.15.6","v6.15.7","v6.15.8","v6.15.9","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.16.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38720.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.14.0"},{"fixed":"6.15.11"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38720.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1343a8994ca7dba78f5dd818e89d68331c21c35d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c875503a9b9082928d7d3fc60b5400d16fbfae4e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d85a6346fd6f595c4914205762d0cdf35c004a5e"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/38xxx/CVE-2025-38720.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38720"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/38xxx/CVE-2025-38720.json"}}
