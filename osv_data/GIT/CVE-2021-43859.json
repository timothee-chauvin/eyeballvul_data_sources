Versions prior to 1.4.19 may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. XStream 1.4.19 monitors and accumulates the time it takes to add elements to collections and throws an exception if a set threshold is exceeded. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade may set the NO_REFERENCE mode to prevent recursion. See GHSA-rmr5-cpv2-vgjf for further details on a workaround if an upgrade is not possible.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8a29e8858b49da45c0071f690d4ceebe8db2f18f"}]}],"versions":["1.324-rc","1.325-rc","1.327-rc","1.328-rc","1.502-rc1","1.580.1-rc1","builds/10","builds/100","builds/101","builds/102","builds/103","builds/104","builds/105","builds/106","builds/107","builds/108","builds/109","builds/11","builds/110","builds/111","builds/112","builds/113","builds/114","builds/115","builds/116","builds/117","builds/118","builds/119","builds/12","builds/120","builds/121","builds/122","builds/123","builds/124","builds/125","builds/126","builds/127","builds/128","builds/13","builds/130","builds/131","builds/132","builds/133","builds/134","builds/135","builds/136","builds/137","builds/138","builds/139","builds/14","builds/140","builds/141","builds/142","builds/143","builds/144","builds/145","builds/146","builds/147","builds/148","builds/149","builds/15","builds/150","builds/151","builds/152","builds/153","builds/154","builds/155","builds/156","builds/157","builds/158","builds/16","builds/160","builds/161","builds/162","builds/163","builds/164","builds/165","builds/166","builds/167","builds/168","builds/169","builds/17","builds/170","builds/171","builds/172","builds/173","builds/174","builds/176","builds/177","builds/178","builds/179","builds/18","builds/180","builds/181","builds/182","builds/183","builds/184","builds/185","builds/186","builds/187","builds/188","builds/189","builds/19","builds/190","builds/191","builds/192","builds/193","builds/194","builds/195","builds/196","builds/197","builds/198","builds/199","builds/2","builds/200","builds/201","builds/202","builds/203","builds/204","builds/205","builds/206","builds/207","builds/209","builds/21","builds/210","builds/211","builds/212","builds/213","builds/214","builds/215","builds/216","builds/217","builds/218","builds/219","builds/22","builds/220","builds/221","builds/222","builds/223","builds/224","builds/225","builds/226","builds/227","builds/228","builds/229","builds/23","builds/230","builds/231","builds/232","builds/233","builds/234","builds/235","builds/236","builds/237","builds/238","builds/239","builds/24","builds/240","builds/241","builds/242","builds/243","builds/244","builds/245","builds/246","builds/247","builds/248","builds/249","builds/250","builds/251","builds/254","builds/255","builds/256","builds/257","builds/258","builds/259","builds/26","builds/260","builds/262","builds/263","builds/264","builds/265","builds/266","builds/267","builds/268","builds/269","builds/27","builds/270","builds/271","builds/272","builds/273","builds/274","builds/275","builds/276","builds/277","builds/278","builds/279","builds/28","builds/280","builds/281","builds/282","builds/283","builds/284","builds/285","builds/286","builds/287","builds/288","builds/29","builds/290","builds/291","builds/292","builds/293","builds/294","builds/295","builds/296","builds/297","builds/298","builds/299","builds/3","builds/30","builds/300","builds/301","builds/302","builds/303","builds/304","builds/305","builds/306","builds/307","builds/308","builds/309","builds/31","builds/310","builds/311","builds/312","builds/313","builds/314","builds/316","builds/317","builds/318","builds/319","builds/32","builds/320","builds/321","builds/322","builds/323","builds/324","builds/325","builds/326","builds/327","builds/328","builds/329","builds/33","builds/330","builds/331","builds/332","builds/333","builds/334","builds/335","builds/336","builds/338","builds/339","builds/34","builds/340","builds/341","builds/342","builds/343","builds/344","builds/345","builds/346","builds/348","builds/35","builds/350","builds/352","builds/353","builds/354","builds/355","builds/356","builds/357","builds/358","builds/359","builds/36","builds/361","builds/362","builds/363","builds/364","builds/365","builds/368","builds/369","builds/37","builds/370","builds/371","builds/372","builds/373","builds/374","builds/375","builds/39","builds/4","builds/40","builds/41","builds/42","builds/43","builds/44","builds/46","builds/47","builds/48","builds/49","builds/5","builds/50","builds/51","builds/52","builds/53","builds/54","builds/55","builds/56","builds/57","builds/58","builds/59","builds/6","builds/60","builds/62","builds/63","builds/64","builds/65","builds/66","builds/67","builds/68","builds/69","builds/7","builds/70","builds/71","builds/72","builds/73","builds/74","builds/75","builds/77","builds/81","builds/82","builds/83","builds/85","builds/86","builds/88","builds/89","builds/9","builds/90","builds/92","builds/93","builds/94","builds/95","builds/96","builds/97","builds/98","builds/99","changes/10","changes/100","changes/101","changes/102","changes/103","changes/104","changes/105","changes/106","changes/107","changes/108","changes/109","changes/11","changes/110","changes/111","changes/112","changes/113","changes/114","changes/115","changes/116","changes/117","changes/118","changes/119","changes/12","changes/120","changes/121"
