{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-31223","published":"2024-07-03T17:34:48Z","modified":"2025-10-21T19:33:23Z","aliases":["GHSA-53q7-4874-24qg"],"summary":"Fides Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Privacy Center of SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL","details":"Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform, and `SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` is a server-side configuration environment variable used by the Fides Privacy Center to communicate with the Fides webserver backend. The value of this variable is a URL which typically includes a private IP address, private domain name, and/or port. A vulnerability present starting in version 2.19.0 and prior to version 2.39.2rc0 allows an unauthenticated attacker to make a HTTP GET request from the Privacy Center that discloses the value of this server-side URL. This could result in disclosure of server-side configuration giving an attacker information on server-side ports, private IP addresses, and/or private domain names. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version 2.39.2rc0. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ethyca/fides","events":[{"introduced":"9889a69e3d2e914611cd0ccfe8493d5fcb2f5390"},{"fixed":"1aae5ab515c03ab3dba9fdc541ffc9c858b87139"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-31223.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-53q7-4874-24qg"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/0555080541f18a5aacff452c590ac9a1b56d7097"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-497"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
