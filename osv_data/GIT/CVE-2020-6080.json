When encountering errors while parsing mDNS messages, some allocated data is not freed, possibly leading to a denial-of-service condition via resource exhaustion. An attacker can send one mDNS message repeatedly to trigger this vulnerability through the function rr_read_RR [5] reads the current resource record, except for the RDATA section. This is read by the loop at in rr_read. For each RR type, a different function is called. When the RR type is 0x10, the function rr_read_TXT is called at [6].","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/videolabs/libmicrodns","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"a12486a5aea85e0f3f02a3721855963b5f1e185f"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.10","0.0.2","0.0.3","0.0.4","0.0.5","0.0.6","0.0.7","0.0.8","0.0.9","0.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-6080.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202005-10"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1002"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4671"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
