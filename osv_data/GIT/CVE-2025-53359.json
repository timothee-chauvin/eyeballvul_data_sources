{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-53359","published":"2025-07-02T15:55:18.026Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:19:19.401375Z","aliases":["GHSA-3w94-vq2x-v5wr"],"summary":"ethereum does not check transaction malleability for EIP-2930, EIP-1559 and EIP-7702 transactions","details":"ethereum is a common ethereum structs for Rust. Prior to ethereum crate v0.18.0, signature malleability (according to EIP-2) was only checked for \"legacy\" transactions, but not for EIP-2930, EIP-1559 and EIP-7702 transactions. This is a specification deviation. The signature malleability itself is not a security issue and not as high of a risk if the ethereum crate is used on a single-implementation blockchain. This issue has been patched in version v0.18.0. A workaround for this issue involves manually checking transaction malleability outside of the crate, however upgrading is recommended.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rust-ethereum/ethereum","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"23e082f0df5aecd038039b45eaa31d52f39fb5bf"}]}],"versions":["v0.16.0","v0.17.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53359.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/53xxx/CVE-2025-53359.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rust-ethereum/ethereum/commit/2dd9d1d5d0936ec7350093ff3a5a7169a349db77"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rust-ethereum/ethereum/pull/67"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rust-ethereum/ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-3w94-vq2x-v5wr"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53359"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-754"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/53xxx/CVE-2025-53359.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
