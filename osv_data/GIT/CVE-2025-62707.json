Prior to version 6.1.3, an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop. This requires parsing the content stream of a page which has an inline image using the DCTDecode filter. This has been fixed in pypdf version 6.1.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4a613f3fbe7af8ef65bbae740ceabe35310db4ee"}]}],"versions":["1.26.0","1.27.0","1.27.1","1.27.10","1.27.11","1.27.12","1.27.2","1.27.3","1.27.4","1.27.5","1.27.6","1.27.7","1.27.8","1.27.9","1.28.0","1.28.1","1.28.2","2.0.0","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.10.0","2.10.1","2.10.2","2.10.3","2.10.4","2.10.5","2.10.6","2.10.7","2.10.8","2.10.9","2.11.0","2.11.1","2.11.2","2.12.0","2.12.1","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.5.0","2.6.0","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.9.0","3.0.0","3.1.0","3.10.0","3.11.0","3.11.1","3.12.0","3.12.1","3.12.2","3.13.0","3.14.0","3.15.0","3.15.1","3.15.2","3.15.3","3.15.4","3.15.5","3.16.0","3.16.1","3.16.2","3.16.3","3.16.4","3.17.0","3.17.1","3.17.2","3.17.3","3.17.4","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.3.0","3.4.0","3.4.1","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.5.2","3.6.0","3.7.0","3.7.1","3.8.0","3.8.1","3.9.0","3.9.1","4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.1.0","4.2.0","4.3.0","4.3.1","5.0.0","5.0.1","5.1.0","5.2.0","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.4.0","5.5.0","5.6.0","5.6.1","5.7.0","5.8.0","5.9.0","6.0.0","6.1.0","6.1.1","6.1.2","v1.17","v1.18","v1.19","v1.20","v1.21","v1.22","v1.23","v1.24","v1.25","v1.25.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62707.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/commit/f2864d6dd9bac7cecd3f4f54308b25ebbfa178f8"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/3501"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/releases/tag/6.1.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/security/advisories/GHSA-vr63-x8vc-m265"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-834"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
