  "details": "fhir-works-on-aws-authz-smart is an implementation of the authorization interface from the FHIR Works interface. Versions 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 are subject to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. This issue allows a client of the API to retrieve more information than the client\u2019s OAuth scope permits when making \u201csearch-type\u201d requests. This issue would not allow a client to retrieve information about individuals other than those the client was already authorized to access. Users of fhir-works-on-aws-authz-smart 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 should upgrade to version 3.1.3 or higher immediately. Versions 3.1.0 and below are unaffected. There is no workaround for this issue.",
