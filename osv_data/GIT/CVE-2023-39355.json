{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-39355","published":"2023-08-31T19:45:02.298Z","modified":"2025-11-19T20:04:37.704943Z","aliases":["GHSA-hvwj-vmg6-2f5h"],"summary":"FreeRDP Use-After-Free in RDPGFX_CMDID_RESETGRAPHICS","details":"FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Versions of FreeRDP on the 3.x release branch before beta3 are subject to a Use-After-Free in processing `RDPGFX_CMDID_RESETGRAPHICS` packets. If `context->maxPlaneSize` is 0, `context->planesBuffer` will be freed. However, without updating `context->planesBuffer`, this leads to a Use-After-Free exploit vector. In most environments this should only result in a crash. This issue has been addressed in version 3.0.0-beta3 and users of the beta 3.x releases are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freerdp/freerdp","events":[{"introduced":"f468a06d88c55b9ed484757326a9528cf27d33f4"},{"fixed":"59a5726ab36338776539192cae2563951d0ce94b"}]}],"versions":["3.0.0-beta1","3.0.0-beta2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-39355.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/commit/d6f9d33a7db0b346195b6a15b5b99944ba41beee"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/security/advisories/GHSA-hvwj-vmg6-2f5h"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00008.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-16"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-416"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H"}]}
