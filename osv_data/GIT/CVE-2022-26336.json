This package is used to read TNEF files (Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server). If an application uses poi-scratchpad to parse TNEF files and the application allows untrusted users to supply them, then a carefully crafted file can cause an Out of Memory exception. This issue affects poi-scratchpad version 5.2.0 and prior versions. Users are recommended to upgrade to poi-scratchpad 5.2.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/poi","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3a19997a29d91f8fb6fe8bb2500400f3b20a5221"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-26336.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/sprg0kq986pc2271dc3v2oxb1f9qx09j"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221028-0006/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
