The HTTP Gateway processes headers, but with no timeout set. With a slow loris attack, an attacker could cause Denial of Service (DoS). Exploitation does not require authentication nor authorization, so anyone can exploit it. It should nonetheless not be exploitable as it is highly recommended to bury Chall-Manager deep within the infrastructure due to its large capabilities, so no users could reach the system. Patch has been implemented by commit 1385bd8 and shipped in v0.1.4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e391620684f2466b75fe708f2ea75806ca9e2f82"}]}],"versions":["sdk/v0.1.0","sdk/v0.1.1","sdk/v0.1.2","sdk/v0.1.3","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53634.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager/security/advisories/GHSA-ggmv-j932-q89q"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager/commit/1385bd869142651146cd0b123085f91cec698636"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ctfer-io/chall-manager/releases/tag/v0.1.4"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
