{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-28111","published":"2024-03-06T21:15:02Z","modified":"2025-10-21T19:32:31Z","aliases":["GHSA-fqh6-v4qp-65fv"],"summary":"CSV Injection in exported history CSV files","details":"Canarytokens helps track activity and actions on a network. Canarytokens.org supports exporting the history of a Canarytoken's incidents in CSV format. The generation of these CSV files is vulnerable to a CSV Injection vulnerability. This flaw can be used by an attacker who discovers an HTTP-based Canarytoken to target the Canarytoken's owner, if the owner exports the incident history to CSV and opens in a reader application such as Microsoft Excel. The impact is that this issue could lead to code execution on the machine on which the CSV file is opened. Version sha-c595a1f8 contains a fix for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c595a1f884b986da2ca05aa5bff9ae5f93c6a4aa"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-28111.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens/security/advisories/GHSA-fqh6-v4qp-65fv"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens/commit/c595a1f884b986da2ca05aa5bff9ae5f93c6a4aa"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1236"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
