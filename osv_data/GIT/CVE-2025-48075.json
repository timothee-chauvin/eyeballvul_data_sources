{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-48075","published":"2025-05-22T17:25:18Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:46:18.916741Z","aliases":["GHSA-hg3g-gphw-5hhm","GO-2025-3706"],"summary":"Fiber panics when fiber.Ctx.BodyParser parses invalid range index","details":"Fiber is an Express-inspired web framework written in Go. Starting in version 2.52.6 and prior to version 2.52.7, `fiber.Ctx.BodyParser` can map flat data to nested slices using `key[idx]value` syntax, but when idx is negative, it causes a panic instead of returning an error stating it cannot process the data. Since this data is user-provided, this could lead to denial of service for anyone relying on this `fiber.Ctx.BodyParser`  functionality. Version 2.52.7 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gofiber/fiber","events":[{"introduced":"e04f815c43cb8a84f4de90e1d1bd9507bc33fa8c"},{"fixed":"e115c08b8f059a4a031b492aa9eef0712411853d"}]}],"versions":["v2.52.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48075.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/security/advisories/GHSA-hg3g-gphw-5hhm"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/commit/e115c08b8f059a4a031b492aa9eef0712411853d"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-129"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
