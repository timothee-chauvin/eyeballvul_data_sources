Starting in version 1.14.0 and prior to versions 1.14.16 and 1.15.10, a policy rule denying a prefix that is broader than `/32` may be ignored if there is a policy rule referencing a more narrow prefix (`CIDRSet` or `toFQDN`) and this narrower policy rule specifies either `enableDefaultDeny: false` or `- toEntities: all`. Note that a rule specifying `toEntities: world` or `toEntities: 0.0.0.0/0` is insufficient, it must be to entity `all`.This issue has been patched in Cilium v1.14.16 and v1.15.10. As this issue only affects policies using `enableDefaultDeny: false` or that set `toEntities` to `all`, some workarounds are available. For users with policies using `enableDefaultDeny: false`, remove this configuration option and explicitly define any allow rules required. For users with egress policies that explicitly specify `toEntities: all`, use `toEntities: world`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium","events":[{"introduced":"2db45c468981a863b230186ad37d44e5a7c08d61"},{"fixed":"2fdab41a13d2a3f8abbbb4d3b4ba8cc1624c3935"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium","events":[{"introduced":"b5013e1562dbfe442dd2011a5af46de9095315ff"},{"fixed":"c2fcf1db31b1b408662471cbe1fddd121bd9678a"}]}],"versions":["1.14.0","1.14.1","1.14.10","1.14.11","1.14.12","1.14.13","1.14.14","1.14.15","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.14.5","1.14.6","1.14.7","1.14.8","1.14.9","1.15.0","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.15.3","1.15.4","1.15.5","1.15.6","1.15.7","1.15.8","1.15.9","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.14.10","v1.14.11","v1.14.12","v1.14.13","v1.14.14","v1.14.15","v1.14.2","v1.14.3","v1.14.4","v1.14.5","v1.14.6","v1.14.7","v1.14.8","v1.14.9","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.15.2","v1.15.3","v1.15.4","v1.15.5","v1.15.6","v1.15.7","v1.15.8","v1.15.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47825.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-3wwx-63fv-pfq6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-276"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
