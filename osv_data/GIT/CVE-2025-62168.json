{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62168","published":"2025-10-17T16:21:30Z","modified":"2025-11-14T19:40:39.507306Z","aliases":["GHSA-c8cc-phh7-xmxr"],"related":["ALSA-2025:19107"],"summary":"Squid vulnerable to information disclosure via authentication credential leakage in error handling","details":"Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. In Squid versions prior to 7.2, a failure to redact HTTP authentication credentials in error handling allows information disclosure. The vulnerability allows a script to bypass browser security protections and learn the credentials a trusted client uses to authenticate. This potentially allows a remote client to identify security tokens or credentials used internally by a web application using Squid for backend load balancing. These attacks do not require Squid to be configured with HTTP authentication. The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.2. As a workaround, disable debug information in administrator mailto links generated by Squid by configuring squid.conf with email_err_data off.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/squid-cache/squid","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"47319f017296369466edd21bccc64d194598da5a"}]}],"versions":["4.15-20210522-snapshot","4.15-20210523-snapshot","4.15-20210524-snapshot","4.15-20210525-snapshot","4.15-20210527-snapshot","5.0.6-20210522-snapshot","5.0.6-20210523-snapshot","5.0.6-20210524-snapshot","5.0.6-20210525-snapshot","5.0.6-20210527-snapshot","6.0.0-20210522-master-snapshot","6.0.0-20210523-master-snapshot","6.0.0-20210524-master-snapshot","6.0.0-20210525-master-snapshot","6.0.0-20210527-master-snapshot","BASIC_TPROXY4","BumpSslServerFirst.take01","BumpSslServerFirst.take02","BumpSslServerFirst.take03","BumpSslServerFirst.take04","BumpSslServerFirst.take05","BumpSslServerFirst.take06","BumpSslServerFirst.take07","BumpSslServerFirst.take08","BumpSslServerFirst.take09","BumpSslServerFirst.take10","HISTORIC_RELEASES","M-staged-PR161","M-staged-PR164","M-staged-PR170","M-staged-PR176","M-staged-PR179","M-staged-PR181","M-staged-PR182","M-staged-PR186","M-staged-PR189","M-staged-PR193","M-staged-PR195","M-staged-PR196","M-staged-PR198","M-staged-PR199","M-staged-PR200","M-staged-PR202","M-staged-PR206","M-staged-PR208","M-staged-PR209","M-staged-PR210","M-staged-PR218","M-staged-PR220","M-staged-PR221","M-staged-PR225","M-staged-PR227","M-staged-PR229","M-staged-PR230","M-staged-PR235","M-staged-PR237","M-staged-PR238","M-staged-PR239","M-staged-PR241","M-staged-PR242","M-staged-PR252","M-staged-PR255","M-staged-PR258","M-staged-PR264","M-staged-PR266","M-staged-PR267","M-staged-PR268","M-staged-PR274","M-staged-PR276","M-staged-PR293","M-staged-PR294","M-staged-PR295","M-staged-PR299","M-staged-PR306","M-staged-PR314","M-staged-PR319","M-staged-PR342","M-staged-PR345","M-staged-PR348","M-staged-PR351","M-staged-PR359","M-staged-PR364","M-staged-PR365","M-staged-PR366","M-staged-PR370","M-staged-PR372","M-staged-PR373","M-staged-PR375","M-staged-PR376","SQUID_3_0_PRE1","SQUID_3_0_PRE2","SQUID_3_0_PRE3","SQUID_3_0_PRE4","SQUID_3_0_PRE5","SQUID_3_0_PRE6","SQUID_3_0_PRE7","SQUID_3_0_RC1","SQUID_3_5_27","SQUID_4_0_1","SQUID_4_0_10","SQUID_4_0_11","SQUID_4_0_12","SQUID_4_0_13","SQUID_4_0_14","SQUID_4_0_15","SQUID_4_0_16","SQUID_4_0_2","SQUID_4_0_3","SQUID_4_0_4","SQUID_4_0_5","SQUID_4_0_6","SQUID_4_0_7","SQUID_4_0_8","SQUID_4_0_9","SQUID_7_0_1","SQUID_7_0_2","SQUID_7_1","for-libecap-v0p1","merge-candidate-3-v1","merge-candidate-3-v2","sourceformat-review-1","take00","take01","take02","take03","take04","take06","take07","take08","take09","take1","take2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62168.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/11/05/6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/0951a0681011dfca3d78c84fd7f1e19c78a4443f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-c8cc-phh7-xmxr"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-209","CWE-550"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
