This causes tls_push_record() to go on\nthe `split = true` path (which is only supposed to be used when interacting\nwith an attached BPF program), and then get further confused and hit the\ntls_merge_open_record() path, which then assumes that there must be at\nleast one populated buffer element, leading to a NULL deref.\n\nIt is possible to have empty plaintext/ciphertext buffers if we previously\nbailed from tls_sw_sendmsg_locked() via the tls_trim_both_msgs() path.\ntls_sw_push_pending_record() already handles this case correctly; let's do\nthe same check in tls_sw_splice_eof().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"5ad627faed136089e27bcd15e0c33760e575c8c3"},{"fixed":"944900fe2736c07288efe2d9394db4d3ca23f2c9"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"df720d288dbb1793e82b6ccbfc670ec871e9def4"},{"fixed":"2214e2bb5489145aba944874d0ee1652a0a63dc8"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"df720d288dbb1793e82b6ccbfc670ec871e9def4"},{"fixed":"53f2cb491b500897a619ff6abd72f565933760f0"}]}],"versions":["v6.4","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.2","v6.6.3","v6.7-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-52767.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.5.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-52767.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2214e2bb5489145aba944874d0ee1652a0a63dc8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/53f2cb491b500897a619ff6abd72f565933760f0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/944900fe2736c07288efe2d9394db4d3ca23f2c9"}]}
