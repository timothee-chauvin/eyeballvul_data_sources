In my case, the tag was hold by a keep alive request\nwaiting inside admin_q, as we quiesced admin_q while reset ctrl, so the\nrequest maked as idle and will not process before reset success. As\nfabric_q shares tagset with admin_q, while reconnect remote target, we\nneed a tag for connect command, but the only one reserved tag was held\nby keep alive command which waiting inside admin_q. As a result, we\nfailed to reconnect admin_q forever. In order to fix this issue, I\nthink we should keep two reserved tags for admin queue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ed01fee283a067c72b2d6500046080dbc1bb9dae"},{"fixed":"149afee5c7418ec5db9d7387b9c9a5c1eb7ea2a8"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ed01fee283a067c72b2d6500046080dbc1bb9dae"},{"fixed":"ff2f90f88d78559802466ad1c84ac5bda4416b3a"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ed01fee283a067c72b2d6500046080dbc1bb9dae"},{"fixed":"6851778504cdb49431809b4ba061903d5f592c96"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ed01fee283a067c72b2d6500046080dbc1bb9dae"},{"fixed":"262da920896e2f2ab0e3947d9dbee0aa09045818"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ed01fee283a067c72b2d6500046080dbc1bb9dae"},{"fixed":"de105068fead55ed5c07ade75e9c8e7f86a00d1d"}]}],"versions":["v5.12","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.3","v6.6.4","v6.6.5","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.7.1","v6.7.10","v6.7.2","v6.7.3","v6.7.4","v6.7.5","v6.7.6","v6.7.7","v6.7.8","v6.7.9","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-27435.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.83"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.23"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.7.11"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.8.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-27435.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/149afee5c7418ec5db9d7387b9c9a5c1eb7ea2a8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/262da920896e2f2ab0e3947d9dbee0aa09045818"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6851778504cdb49431809b4ba061903d5f592c96"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/de105068fead55ed5c07ade75e9c8e7f86a00d1d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ff2f90f88d78559802466ad1c84ac5bda4416b3a"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N
