{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-65562","published":"2025-12-18T19:16:33.747Z","modified":"2026-01-09T07:59:17.149544Z","details":"The free5GC UPF suffers from a lack of bounds checking on the SEID when processing PFCP Session Deletion Requests. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a request with a very large SEID (e.g., 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) that causes an integer conversion/underflow in LocalNode.DeleteSess() / LocalNode.Sess() when a uint64 SEID is converted to int and used in index arithmetic. This leads to a negative index into n.sess and a Go runtime panic, resulting in a denial of service (UPF crash). The issue has been reproduced on free5GC v4.1.0 with crashes observed in the session lookup/deletion path in internal/pfcp/node.go; other versions may also be affected. No authentication is required.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/free5gc/free5gc","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"de6bdb7a0d5963266c893cca59c86f55df348f57"}]}],"versions":["v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.3.0","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.4.2","v3.4.3","v3.4.4","v3.4.5","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65562.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/free5gc/free5gc/issues/731"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
