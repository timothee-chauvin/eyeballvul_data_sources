At ospd_common.c, on the osdp_reply_name function, any reply id between REPLY_ACK and REPLY_XRD is valid, but names array do not declare all of the range. On a case of an undefined reply id within the range, name will be null (name = names[reply_id - REPLY_ACK];). Null name will casue a crash on next line: if (name[0] == '\\0') as null[0] is invalid. As this logic is not limited to a secure connection, attacker may trigger this vulnerability without any prior knowledge. This issue is fixed in 2.4.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gotomain/libosdp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ebdf6ab4d3926b7b4215d6a3a162f0327c57f8f7"}]}],"versions":["v0.1","v0.2","v0.3","v0.4","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-52296.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/goToMain/libosdp/commit/24409e98a260176765956ec766a04cb35984fab1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/goToMain/libosdp/security/advisories/GHSA-7945-5mcv-f2pp"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
