When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pomsky-lang/pomsky","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"60aa2dc03a22d69c8800fec81f99c96958a11363"}]}],"versions":["v0.1","v0.2","v0.3","v0.4","v0.4.1","v0.4.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31099.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rulex-rs/pomsky","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7061f4bae01256c90c27bda03ea49eaa26796efc"}]}],"versions":["v0.1","v0.2","v0.3","v0.4","v0.4.1","v0.4.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31099.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rulex-rs/rulex/commit/60aa2dc03a22d69c8800fec81f99c96958a11363"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rulex-rs/rulex/security/advisories/GHSA-v78m-2q7v-fjqp"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-674"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
