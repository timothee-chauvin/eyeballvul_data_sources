{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-38691","published":"2023-08-04T16:34:54Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:38:46.541848Z","aliases":["GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x"],"summary":"matrix-appservice-bridge doesn't verify the sub parameter of an openId token exhange, allowing unauthorized access to provisioning APIs","details":"matrix-appservice-bridge provides an API for setting up bridges. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1, a malicious Matrix server can use a foreign user's MXID in an OpenID exchange, allowing a bad actor to impersonate users when using the provisioning API. The library does not check that the servername part of the `sub` parameter (containing the user's *claimed* MXID) is the the same as the servername we are talking to. A malicious actor could spin up a server on any given domain, respond with a `sub` parameter according to the user they want to act as and use the resulting token to perform provisioning requests. Versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1 contain a patch. As a workaround, disable the provisioning API.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge","events":[{"introduced":"30f6e3a4f4c8e3ec0c4d08055e39845a71d34763"},{"fixed":"48cf6d7ca4e8b0db2f738ce14014b4b34576906c"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"533f27cb9a779a905b6b408ebd04f4c49963c84e"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.1.2","0.1.3","0.1.4","0.1.5","0.3.2","0.3.3","0.3.4","0.3.5","0.3.6","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.1","1.10.0","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.10.3","1.11.0","1.11.1","1.12.0","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.13.0","1.13.1","1.2.1","1.3.0","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.5","1.3.6","1.4.0","1.4.0a","1.5.0","1.5.0a","1.6.0","1.6.0a","1.6.0b","1.6.0c","1.6.1","1.7.0","1.8.1","1.9.0","1.9.1","1.9.2","2.0.0","2.1.0","2.1.0-rc1","2.1.0-rc2","2.2.0","2.2.0-rc1","2.2.0-rc2","2.3.0","2.3.0-rc1","2.3.0-rc2","2.3.0-rc3","2.3.1","2.4.0","2.4.0-rc1","2.4.0-rc2","2.5.0","2.6.0","2.6.0-rc1","2.6.1","2.7.0","3.0.0","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.2.0","4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","5.0.0","5.1.0","7.0.0","8.0.0","8.0.1","8.1.0","8.1.1","9.0.0","v1.13.2","v2.5.0-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-38691.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/security/advisories/GHSA-vc7j-h8xg-fv5x"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/commit/4c6723a5e7beda65cdf1ae5dbb882e8beaac8552"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
