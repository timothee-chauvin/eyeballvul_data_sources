Starting with 6.1, HTTP Inputs can be configured to check if a specified header is present and has a specified value to authenticate HTTP-based ingestion. Unfortunately, even though in cases of a missing header or a wrong value the correct HTTP response (401) is returned, the message will be ingested nonetheless. To mitigate the vulnerability, disable http-based inputs and allow only authenticated pull-based inputs. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.1.9.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/graylog2/graylog2-server","events":[{"introduced":"cb28959341c6e8bde044718c0269f6155a9ecd66"},{"fixed":"bacfdef1fa5465f3ca6c23084789ad2c26b94c88"}]}],"versions":["6.1.0","6.1.1","6.1.2","6.1.3","6.1.4","6.1.5","6.1.6","6.1.7","6.1.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-30373.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/commit/31bc13d3cd6f550ec83473d0f8666cd3ebf50f10"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/security/advisories/GHSA-q7g5-jq6p-6wvx"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-285"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"}]}
