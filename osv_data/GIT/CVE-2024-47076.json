The `cfGetPrinterAttributes5` function in `libcupsfilters` does not sanitize IPP attributes returned from an IPP server. When these IPP attributes are used, for instance, to generate a PPD file, this can lead to attacker controlled data to be provided to the rest of the CUPS system.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openprinting/cups-browsed","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47076.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openprinting/cups-filters","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47076.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openprinting/libcupsfilters","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"95576ec3d20c109332d14672a807353cdc551018"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.0b1","2.0b2","2.0b3","2.0b4","2.0rc1","2.0rc2","2.1b1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47076.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["161359513121773949907926455193830173566","154108727522163752832459989576150002054","303212411057175221772250729228838139471","10013934268424892536252883675686381330"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2024-47076-1f7f608d","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/openprinting/libcupsfilters/commit/95576ec3d20c109332d14672a807353cdc551018","target":{"file":"cupsfilters/ipp.c"}}]}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openprinting/libppd","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47076.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-browsed/security/advisories/GHSA-rj88-6mr5-rcw8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/security/advisories/GHSA-p9rh-jxmq-gq47"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/security/advisories/GHSA-w63j-6g73-wmg5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libppd/security/advisories/GHSA-7xfx-47qg-grp6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/commit/95576ec3d20c109332d14672a807353cdc551018"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.cups.org"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
