{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-25290","published":"2025-02-14T19:37:47.110Z","modified":"2025-12-05T08:53:21.535228Z","aliases":["GHSA-rmvr-2pp2-xj38"],"related":["CGA-4pq2-47w9-79cx","CGA-8hrm-r7xj-7739"],"summary":"@octokit/request has a Regular Expression in fetchWrapper that Leads to ReDoS Vulnerability Due to Catastrophic Backtracking","details":"@octokit/request sends parameterized requests to GitHub’s APIs with sensible defaults in browsers and Node. Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to version 9.2.1, the regular expression `/<([^>]+)>; rel=\"deprecation\"/` used to match the `link` header in HTTP responses is vulnerable to a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attack. This vulnerability arises due to the unbounded nature of the regex's matching behavior, which can lead to catastrophic backtracking when processing specially crafted input. An attacker could exploit this flaw by sending a malicious `link` header, resulting in excessive CPU usage and potentially causing the server to become unresponsive, impacting service availability. Version 9.2.1 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/octokit/request.js","events":[{"introduced":"5656a363d01f3db1fcf66828212aa86be507d272"},{"fixed":"6bb29ba92a52f7bf94469c3433707c682c17126c"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v5.0.0","v5.0.1","v5.0.2","v5.0.3","v5.1.0","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.3.3","v5.3.4","v5.4.0","v5.4.1","v5.4.10","v5.4.11","v5.4.12","v5.4.13","v5.4.14","v5.4.15","v5.4.2","v5.4.3","v5.4.4","v5.4.5","v5.4.6","v5.4.7","v5.4.8","v5.4.9","v5.5.0","v5.6.0","v5.6.1","v5.6.2","v5.6.3","v6.0.0","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.1.0","v6.2.0","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4","v6.2.5","v6.2.6","v6.2.7","v7.0.0","v7.0.1","v8.0.0","v8.0.1","v8.0.2","v8.0.3","v8.0.4","v8.1.0","v8.1.1","v8.1.2","v8.1.3","v8.1.4","v8.1.5","v8.1.6","v8.2.0","v9.0.0","v9.0.1","v9.1.0","v9.1.1","v9.1.2","v9.1.3","v9.1.4","v9.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-25290.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/25xxx/CVE-2025-25290.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/octokit/request.js/commit/34ff07ee86fc5c20865982d77391bc910ef19c68"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/octokit/request.js/security/advisories/GHSA-rmvr-2pp2-xj38"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25290"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-1333"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/25xxx/CVE-2025-25290.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
