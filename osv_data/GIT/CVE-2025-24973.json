{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-24973","published":"2025-02-11T15:41:41Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:45:00.618932Z","aliases":["GHSA-2369-p2wh-7cc2"],"summary":"Concorde not removing authentication tokens after logging out","details":"Concorde, formerly know as Nexkey, is a fork of the federated microblogging platform Misskey. Prior to version 12.25Q1.1, due to an improper implementation of the logout process, authentication credentials remain in cookies even after a user has explicitly logged out, which may allow an attacker to steal authentication tokens. This could have devastating consequences if a user with admin privileges is (or was) using a shared device. Users who have logged in on a shared device should go to Settings > Security and regenerate their login tokens. Version 12.25Q1.1 fixes the issue. As a workaround, clear cookies and site data in the browser after logging out.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nexryai/concorde","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5bae3fd373c2cf78245c574824d77d8d3fce3dac"}]}],"versions":["12.119.2-fix.1","12.119.2-fix.2","12.119.2-fix.3","12.119.2-fix.4","12.119.2-fix.5","12.119.2-fix.5.1","12.119.2-fix.5.2","12.119.2-fix.5.3","12.119.2-fix.5.4","12.119.2-fix.5.5","12.119.2-fix.5.6","12.119.2-fix.5.7","12.119.2-fix.5.8","12.119.2-fix.5.9","12.119.2-fix.6.0","v12.23Q4.4","v12.23Q4.5","v12.23Q4.6","v12.23Q4.7","v12.23Q4.8","v12.24Q1.2","v12.24Q1.3","v12.24Q1.4","v12.24Q2.1","v12.24Q2.1-fix","v12.24Q2.2","v12.24Q2.3","v12.24Q2.4","v12.24Q2.5","v12.24Q2.6","v12.24Q3.1","v12.24Q3.2","v12.24Q4.1","v12.24Q4.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-24973.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nexryai/concorde/security/advisories/GHSA-2369-p2wh-7cc2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nexryai/concorde/commit/1f6ac9b289906083b132e4f9667a31a60ef83e4e"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-613"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
