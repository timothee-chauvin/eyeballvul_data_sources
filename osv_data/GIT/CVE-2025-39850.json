That is, if a matching and\nvalid neighbor entry is configured on the VXLAN device whose MAC address\nis not behind the \"any\" remote (0.0.0.0 / ::).\n\nThe code currently assumes that the FDB entry for the neighbor's MAC\naddress points to a valid remote destination, but this is incorrect if\nthe entry is associated with an FDB nexthop group. This can result in a\nNPD [1][3] which can be reproduced using [2][4].\n\nFix by checking that the remote destination exists before dereferencing\nit.\n\n[1]\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference,
