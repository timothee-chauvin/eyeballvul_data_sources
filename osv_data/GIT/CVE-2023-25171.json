{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-25171","published":"2023-02-15T00:00:00Z","modified":"2025-12-04T23:40:56.277569Z","aliases":["GHSA-7j9h-3jxf-3vrf"],"summary":"Kiwi TCMS has denial of service vulnerability on Password reset page","details":"Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system, does not impose rate limits in versions prior to 12.0. This makes it easier to attempt denial-of-service attacks against the Password reset page. An attacker could potentially send a large number of emails if they know the email addresses of users in Kiwi TCMS. Additionally that may strain SMTP resources. Users should upgrade to v12.0 or later to receive a patch. As potential workarounds, users may install and configure a rate-limiting proxy in front of Kiwi TCMS and/or configure rate limits on their email server when possible.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kiwitcms/kiwi","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"761305d04f5910ba14cc04d1255a8f1afdbb87f3"}]}],"versions":["tcms-api-1.4.0","tcms-api-1.5.0","tcms-api-1.5.1","tcms-api-4.0.0","tcms-api-4.2","tcms-api-5.0","tcms-api-5.1","tcms-api-5.2","tcms-api-5.3","v10.0","v10.1","v10.2","v10.3","v10.4","v10.5","v11.0","v11.1","v11.2","v11.3","v11.4","v11.5","v11.6","v11.7","v3.21.1","v3.21.2","v3.22","v3.23","v3.26","v3.28","v3.30","v3.32","v3.33","v3.37","v3.38","v3.39","v3.41","v3.44","v3.48","v3.49","v3.50","v3.8.17-1","v3.8.18","v3.8.18.21","v4.0.0","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.1.3","v4.1.4","v4.2","v5.0","v5.1","v5.2","v5.3","v5.3.1","v6.0","v6.0.1","v6.1","v6.1.1","v6.10","v6.11","v6.2","v6.2.1","v6.3","v6.4","v6.5.1","v6.5.2","v6.5.3","v6.6","v6.7","v6.8","v6.9","v7.0","v7.1","v7.2","v7.2.1","v7.3","v8.0","v8.1","v8.2","v8.3","v8.4","v8.5","v8.6","v8.6.1","v8.7","v8.8","v8.9","v9.0","v9.0.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-25171.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/25xxx/CVE-2023-25171.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/761305d04f5910ba14cc04d1255a8f1afdbb87f3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-7j9h-3jxf-3vrf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://huntr.dev/bounties/3b712cb6-3fa3-4f71-8562-7a7016c6262e"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://kiwitcms.org/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2023/02/15/kiwi-tcms-120/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25171"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/25xxx/CVE-2023-25171.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
