This allows to inject arbitrary data having a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead to various attack chains including potential privilege escalation, insecure deserialization & remote code execution. The overall severity of this vulnerability is high based on mentioned attack chains and the requirement of having a valid backend user session (authenticated). This has been patched in versions 9.5.20 and 10.4.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/typo3/typo3.cms","events":[{"introduced":"41235ff8e38c6f3401df03ae8beddd62d662c525"},{"fixed":"9c66a63af802a9a3da54e21dfd32a8e6acbc0e89"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-15098.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/typo3/typo3","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"85d3e70dff35a99ef53f4b561114acfa9e5c47e1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-15098.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-m5vr-3m74-jwxp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2016-013"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-008"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/commit/85d3e70dff35a99ef53f4b561114acfa9e5c47e1"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
