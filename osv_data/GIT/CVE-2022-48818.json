But there is one more which applies here.\n\nIf the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown\n(like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device link\nbetween the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers()\nwill unbind the Marvell switch driver on shutdown.\n\nsystemd-shutdown[1]: Powering off.\nmv88e6085 0x0000000008b96000:00 sw_gl0: Link
