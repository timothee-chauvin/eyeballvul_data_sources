administratively set MAC\n\nCurrently when PF administratively sets VF's MAC address and the VF\nis put down (VF tries to delete all MACs) then the MAC is removed\nfrom MAC filters and primary VF MAC is zeroed.\n\nDo not allow untrusted VF to remove primary MAC when it was set\nadministratively by PF.\n\nReproducer:\n1) Create VF\n2) Set VF interface up\n3) Administratively set the VF's MAC\n4)
