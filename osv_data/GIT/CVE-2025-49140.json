Versions v0.1.36 through v0.1.38 contain a bug in a RTP packet factory that can be exploited to trigger a panic with Pion based SFU via crafted RTP packets, This only affect users that use pion/interceptor. Users should upgrade to v0.1.39 or later, which validates that: `padLen > 0 && padLen <= payloadLength` and return error  on overflow, avoiding panic. If upgrading is not possible, apply the patch from the pull request manually or drop packets whose P-bit is set but whose padLen is zero or larger than the remaining payload.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pion/interceptor","events":[{"introduced":"bfda3e00334428a1192adb1773f2c408799713f5"},{"fixed":"fa5b35ea867389cec33a9c82fffbd459ca8958e5"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.36","v0.1.37","v0.1.38"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-49140.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pion/interceptor/security/advisories/GHSA-f26w-gh5m-qq77"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pion/interceptor/commit/fa5b35ea867389cec33a9c82fffbd459ca8958e5"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pion/interceptor/pull/338"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/pion/webrtc/issues/3148"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
