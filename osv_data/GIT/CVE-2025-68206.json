{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68206","published":"2025-12-16T13:48:33.763Z","modified":"2026-01-08T20:05:45.509428Z","summary":"netfilter: nft_ct: add seqadj extension for natted connections","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nft_ct: add seqadj extension for natted connections\n\nSequence adjustment may be required for FTP traffic with PASV/EPSV modes.\ndue to need to re-write packet payload (IP, port) on the ftp control\nconnection. This can require changes to the TCP length and expected\nseq / ack_seq.\n\nThe easiest way to reproduce this issue is with PASV mode.\nExample ruleset:\ntable inet ftp_nat {\n        ct helper ftp_helper {\n                type \"ftp\" protocol tcp\n                l3proto inet\n        }\n\n        chain prerouting {\n                type filter hook prerouting priority 0; policy accept;\n                tcp dport 21 ct state new ct helper set \"ftp_helper\"\n        }\n}\ntable ip nat {\n        chain prerouting {\n                type nat hook prerouting priority -100; policy accept;\n                tcp dport 21 dnat ip prefix to ip daddr map {\n\t\t\t192.168.100.1 : 192.168.13.2/32 }\n        }\n\n        chain postrouting {\n                type nat hook postrouting priority 100 ; policy accept;\n                tcp sport 21 snat ip prefix to ip saddr map {\n\t\t\t192.168.13.2 : 192.168.100.1/32 }\n        }\n}\n\nNote that the ftp helper gets assigned *after* the dnat setup.\n\nThe inverse (nat after helper assign) is handled by an existing\ncheck in nf_nat_setup_info() and will not show the problem.\n\nTopoloy:\n\n +-------------------+
