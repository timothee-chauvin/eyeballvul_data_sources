This bug affects Datasette instances running a Datasette 1.0 alpha - 1.0a0, 1.0a1, 1.0a2 or 1.0a3 - in an online accessible location but with authentication enabled using a plugin such as datasette-auth-passwords. The `/-/api` API explorer endpoint could reveal the names of both databases and tables - but not their contents - to an unauthenticated user. Datasette 1.0a4 has a fix for this issue. This will block access to the API explorer but will still allow access to the Datasette read or write JSON APIs, as those use different URL patterns within the Datasette `/database` hierarchy. This issue is patched in version 1.0a4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/simonw/datasette","events":[{"introduced":"4a0bd960e9763623dae6a13c8af3810c4ce9fb0a"},{"fixed":"01e0558825b8f7ec17d3b691aa072daf122fcc74"}]}],"versions":["1.0a0","1.0a1","1.0a2","1.0a3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-40570.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/simonw/datasette/security/advisories/GHSA-7ch3-7pp7-7cpq"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/01e0558825b8f7ec17d3b691aa072daf122fcc74"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-213"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
