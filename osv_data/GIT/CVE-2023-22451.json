{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-22451","published":"2023-01-02T15:56:43.003Z","modified":"2025-11-19T19:47:25.504765Z","aliases":["GHSA-496x-2jqf-hp7g"],"summary":"Weak password requirements in Kiwi TCMS","details":"Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In version 11.6 and prior, when users register new accounts and/or change passwords, there is no validation in place which would prevent them from picking an easy to guess password. This issue is resolved by providing defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting. As of version 11.7, the password can’t be too similar to other personal information, must contain at least 10 characters, can’t be a commonly used password, and can’t be entirely numeric. As a workaround, an administrator may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a weak password may have been chosen.
