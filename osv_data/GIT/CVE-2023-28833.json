{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-28833","published":"2023-03-30T18:49:38Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:37:44.349920Z","aliases":["GHSA-ch7f-px7m-hg25"],"summary":"Unrestricted filenames for logo or favicon as admin in the theming settings in nextcloud server","details":"Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In affected versions admins of a server were able to upload a logo or a favicon and to provided a file name which was not restricted and could overwrite files in the appdata directory. Administrators may have access to overwrite these files by other means but this method could be exploited by tricking an admin into uploading a maliciously named file. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.10 or 25.0.4. Users unable to upgrade should avoid ingesting logo files from untrusted sources.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9fcbbc523ea041301fc5a8acc50d6a8ec5b328e5"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server","events":[{"introduced":"20ea9a25353129b56d46951fe7d23939665ab2b2"},{"fixed":"0c86714144f50a66e845e9ef80d4cd7e6918a4f5"}]}],"versions":["list","v1.0.0beta1","v1.0RC1","v1.1","v11.0.0","v11.0RC2","v12.0.0beta1","v12.0.0beta2","v12.0.0beta3","v12.0.0beta4","v13.0.0RC1","v13.0.0beta1","v13.0.0beta2","v13.0.0beta3","v13.0.0beta4","v14.0.0RC1","v14.0.0RC2","v14.0.0beta1","v14.0.0beta2","v14.0.0beta3","v14.0.0beta4","v15.0.0RC1","v15.0.0beta1","v15.0.0beta2","v16.0.0RC1","v16.0.0alpha1","v16.0.0beta1","v16.0.0beta2","v16.0.0beta3","v17.0.0beta1","v17.0.0beta2","v17.0.0beta3","v17.0.0beta4","v18.0.0RC1","v18.0.0beta1","v18.0.0beta2","v18.0.0beta3","v18.0.0beta4","v19.0.0RC1","v19.0.0RC2","v19.0.0beta1","v19.0.0beta2","v19.0.0beta3","v19.0.0beta4","v19.0.0beta5","v19.0.0beta6","v19.0.0beta7","v2.0beta3","v20.0.0RC1","v20.0.0beta1","v20.0.0beta2","v20.0.0beta3","v20.0.0beta4","v21.0.0beta1","v21.0.0beta2","v21.0.0beta3","v21.0.0beta4","v21.0.0beta5","v21.0.0beta6","v21.0.0beta7","v21.0.0beta8","v22.0.0beta1","v22.0.0beta2","v22.0.0beta3","v22.0.0beta4","v22.0.0beta5","v22.0.0rc1","v23.0.0beta1","v23.0.0beta2","v23.0.0beta3","v24.0.0","v24.0.0beta1","v24.0.0beta2","v24.0.0beta3","v24.0.0rc1","v24.0.0rc2","v24.0.0rc3","v24.0.1","v24.0.10rc1","v24.0.1rc1","v24.0.2","v24.0.2rc1","v24.0.3","v24.0.3rc1","v24.0.3rc2","v24.0.4","v24.0.4rc1","v24.0.5","v24.0.5rc1","v24.0.6","v24.0.6rc1","v24.0.7","v24.0.7rc1","v24.0.8","v24.0.8rc1","v24.0.8rc2","v24.0.9","v24.0.9rc1","v24.0.9rc2","v25.0.0","v25.0.1","v25.0.1rc1","v25.0.2","v25.0.2rc1","v25.0.2rc2","v25.0.2rc3","v25.0.3","v25.0.3rc1","v25.0.3rc2","v25.0.4rc1","v3.0","v3.0RC1","v3.0alpha1","v4.0.0","v4.0.0RC","v4.0.0RC2","v4.0.0beta","v4.0.1","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.5","v4.0.6","v4.5.0","v4.5.0RC1","v4.5.0RC2","v4.5.0RC3","v4.5.0beta1","v4.5.0beta2","v4.5.0beta3","v4.5.0beta4","v5.0.0","v5.0.0RC1","v5.0.0RC2","v5.0.0RC3","v5.0.0alpha1","v5.0.0beta1","v5.0.0beta2","v6.0.0RC1","v6.0.0RC2","v6.0.0alpha2","v6.0.0beta2","v6.0.0beta3","v6.0.0beta4","v6.0.0beta5","v7.0.0alpha2","v7.0.0beta1","v8.0.0","v8.0.0RC1","v8.0.0RC2","v8.0.0alpha1","v8.0.0alpha2","v8.0.0beta1","v8.0.0beta2","v8.1.0alpha1","v8.1.0alpha2","v8.1.0beta1","v8.1.0beta2","v8.1RC2","v8.2RC1","v8.2beta1","v9.0.0beta2","v9.0.1beta2","v9.0beta1","v9.1.0beta1","v9.1.0beta2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-28833.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-ch7f-px7m-hg25"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/36095"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
