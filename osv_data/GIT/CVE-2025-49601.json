{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-49601","published":"2025-07-04T15:15:22Z","modified":"2025-10-22T16:17:55.441201Z","details":"In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_import_public_key does not check that the input buffer is at least 4 bytes before reading a 32-bit field, allowing a possible out-of-bounds read on truncated input. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read in mbedtls_lms_import_public_key allows context-dependent attackers to trigger a crash or limited adjacent-memory disclosure by supplying a truncated LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) public-key buffer under four bytes. An LMS public key starts with a 4-byte type indicator. The function mbedtls_lms_import_public_key reads this type indicator before validating the size of its input.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/armmbed/mbedtls","events":[{"introduced":"8c89224991adff88d53cd380f42a2baa36f91454"},{"fixed":"c765c831e5c2a0971410692f92f7a81d6ec65ec2"}]}],"versions":["mbedtls-3.3.0","mbedtls-3.4.0","mbedtls-3.4.1","mbedtls-3.5.0","mbedtls-3.5.1","mbedtls-3.5.2","mbedtls-3.6.0","mbedtls-3.6.1","mbedtls-3.6.2","mbedtls-3.6.3","v3.3.0","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.6.2","v3.6.3","v3.6.3.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-49601.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls-docs/blob/main/security-advisories/mbedtls-security-advisory-2025-06-4.md"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L"}]}
