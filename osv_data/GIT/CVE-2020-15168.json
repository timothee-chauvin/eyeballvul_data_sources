For most people, this fix will have a little or no impact. However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate files above a size, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don't double-check the size of the data after fetch() has completed, your JS thread could get tied up doing work on a large file (DoS) and/or cost you money in computing.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b5e2e41b2b50bf2997720d6125accaf0dd68c0ab"}]}],"versions":["v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha.1","v2.0.0-alpha.3","v2.0.0-alpha.4","v2.0.0-alpha.5","v2.0.0-alpha.6","v2.0.0-alpha.7","v2.0.0-alpha.8","v2.0.0-alpha.9","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-15168.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/security/advisories/GHSA-w7rc-rwvf-8q5r"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
