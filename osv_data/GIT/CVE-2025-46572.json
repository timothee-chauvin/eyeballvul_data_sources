A vulnerability present starting in version 3.0.5 up to and including version 4.6.3 allows an attacker to impersonate any user during SAML authentication by crafting a SAMLResponse. This can be done by using a valid SAML object that was signed by the configured IdP. Users are affected specifically when the service provider is using passport-wsfed-saml2 and a valid SAML document signed by the Identity Provider can be obtained. Version 4.6.4 contains a fix for the vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/auth0/passport-wsfed-saml2","events":[{"introduced":"cc8d85e2dba45218e6d6afed9948c577f3669503"},{"fixed":"e5cf3cc2a53748207f7a81bfba9195c8efa94181"}]}],"versions":["v3.0.10","v3.0.11","v3.0.12","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.0.8","v3.0.9","v4.0.0","v4.2.0","v4.3.0","v4.4.0","v4.5.0","v4.5.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-46572.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/auth0/passport-wsfed-saml2/commit/e5cf3cc2a53748207f7a81bfba9195c8efa94181"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/auth0/passport-wsfed-saml2/security/advisories/GHSA-wjmp-wphq-jvqf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
