In versions 0.6.12 and prior, the pam_pkcs11 module segfaults when a user presses ctrl-c/ctrl-d when they are asked for a PIN. When a user enters no PIN at all, `pam_get_pwd` will never initialize the password buffer pointer and as such `cleanse` will try to dereference an uninitialized pointer. On my system this pointer happens to have the value 3 most of the time when running sudo and as such it will segfault. The most likely impact to a system affected by this issue is an availability impact due to a daemon that uses PAM crashing. As of time of publication, a patch for the issue is unavailable.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opensc/pam_pkcs11","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"bb2e3f3a95e44fdf44b0d5a4b377db3179021380"}]}],"versions":["pam_pkcs11-0.5.2","pam_pkcs11-0.6.10","pam_pkcs11-0.6.11","pam_pkcs11-0.6.12","pam_pkcs11-0.6.7","pam_pkcs11-0.6.8","pam_pkcs11-0.6.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-24031.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/security/advisories/GHSA-wvr3-c9x3-9mff"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/blob/bb2e3f3a95e44fdf44b0d5a4b377db3179021380/src/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.c#L211"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/blob/bb2e3f3a95e44fdf44b0d5a4b377db3179021380/src/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.c#L797"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:L"}]}
