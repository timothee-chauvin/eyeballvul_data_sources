In versions prior to 3.24.0, there is a potential data leak when duplicating a duplicated context. Quarkus extensively uses the Vert.x duplicated context to implement context propagation. With the new semantic data from one transaction can leak to the data from another transaction. From a Vert.x point of view, this new semantic clarifies the behavior. A significant amount of data is stored in the duplicated context, including request scope, security details, and metadata. Duplicating a duplicated context is rather rare and is only done in a few places. This issue has been patched in version 3.24.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ec69da77faf45effdfee9e4d55159bfd0183a169"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-49574.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/security/advisories/GHSA-9623-mj7j-p9v4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/commit/2b58f59f4bf0bae7d35b1abb585b65f2a66787d1"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/48227"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-668"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
