It shows that we miss freeing struct seccomp_filter\nand some objects included in it.\n\nWe can reproduce the issue with the program below [2] which calls one\nseccomp() and two clone() syscalls.\n\nThe first clone()d child exits earlier than its parent and sends a\nsignal to kill it during the second clone(), more precisely before the\nfatal_signal_pending() test in copy_process().  When the parent receives\nthe signal, it has to destroy the embryonic process and return -EINTR to\nuser space.  In the failure path, we have to call seccomp_filter_release()\nto decrement the filter's refcount.\n\nInitially, we called it in free_task() called from the failure path, but\nthe commit 3a15fb6ed92c (\"seccomp: release filter after task is fully\ndead\") moved it to release_task() to notify user space as early as possible\nthat the filter is no longer used.\n\nTo keep the change and current seccomp refcount semantics, let's move\ncopy_seccomp() just after the signal check and add a WARN_ON_ONCE() in\nfree_task() for future debugging.\n\n[0]:\nunreferenced object 0xffff8880063add00 (size
