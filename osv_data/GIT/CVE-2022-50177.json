Now since rcutorture\ninitialization only boosts the ksoftirqds of the CPUs that have been\nset online on boot, the CPUs later set online by torture_onoff won't\nbenefit from the boost, making RCU priority boosting fail.\n\n2) The ksoftirqd kthreads are boosted after the creation of\nrcu_torture_boost() kthreads, which opens a window large enough for these\nrcu_torture_boost() kthreads to wait (despite running at FIFO priority)\nfor ksoftirqds that are still running at SCHED_NORMAL priority.\n\nThe issues can trigger for example with:\n\n\t./kvm.sh --configs TREE01 --kconfig \"CONFIG_RCU_BOOST=y\"\n\n\t[   34.968561] rcu-torture: !!!\n\t[   34.968627] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n\t[   35.014054] WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 114 at kernel/rcu/rcutorture.c:1979 rcu_torture_stats_print+0x5ad/0x610\n\t[   35.052043] Modules linked in:\n\t[   35.069138] CPU: 4 PID: 114 Comm: rcu_torture_sta Not tainted 5.18.0-rc1 #1\n\t[   35.096424] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.14.0-0-g155821a-rebuilt.opensuse.org 04/01/2014\n\t[   35.154570] RIP: 0010:rcu_torture_stats_print+0x5ad/0x610\n\t[   35.198527] Code: 63 1b 02 00 74 02 0f 0b 48 83 3d 35 63 1b 02 00 74 02 0f 0b 48 83 3d 21 63 1b 02 00 74 02 0f 0b 48 83 3d 0d 63 1b 02 00 74 02 <0f> 0b 83 eb 01 0f 8e ba fc ff ff 0f 0b e9 b3 fc ff f82\n\t[   37.251049] RSP: 0000:ffffa92a0050bdf8 EFLAGS: 00010202\n\t[   37.277320] rcu: De-offloading 8\n\t[   37.290367] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000001 RCX: 0000000000000001\n\t[   37.290387] RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 00000000ffffbfff RDI: 00000000ffffffff\n\t[   37.290398] RBP: 000000000000007b R08: 0000000000000000 R09: c0000000ffffbfff\n\t[   37.290407] R10: 000000000000002a R11: ffffa92a0050bc18 R12: ffffa92a0050be20\n\t[   37.290417] R13: ffffa92a0050be78 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: 000000000001bea0\n\t[   37.290427] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff96045eb00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n\t[   37.290448] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n\t[   37.290460] CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 000000001dc0c000 CR4: 00000000000006e0\n\t[   37.290470] Call Trace:\n\t[   37.295049]  <TASK>\n\t[   37.295065]  ?
