{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-58374","published":"2025-09-06T02:19:40Z","modified":"2025-10-21T19:33:05Z","aliases":["GHSA-c292-qxq4-4p2v"],"summary":"Roo Code: Auto-approve allows npm install execution of malicious postinstall scripts","details":"Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in users' editors. Versions 3.25.23 and below contain a default list of allowed commands that do not need manual approval if auto-approve is enabled, and npm install is included in that list. Because npm install executes lifecycle scripts, if a repositoryâ€™s package.json file contains a malicious postinstall script, it would be executed automatically without user approval. This means that enabling auto-approved commands and opening a malicious repo could result in arbitrary code execution. This is fixed in version 3.26.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/roocodeinc/roo-code","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"840fe2a4c8b6331f2fcb43e4ddaba8950a0b4bf0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58374.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/security/advisories/GHSA-c292-qxq4-4p2v"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7390/files"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/releases/tag/v3.26.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-78"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
