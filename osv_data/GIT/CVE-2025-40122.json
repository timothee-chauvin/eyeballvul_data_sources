It leads to an invalid ACR counter\nmask from user space could be set into hw.config1 and then written into\nCFG_B MSRs and trigger the MSR access warning.\n\ne.g., User may create a perf event with ACR counter mask (config2=0xcb),\nand there is only 1 event created, so \"cpuc->n_events\" is 1.\n\nThe correct check condition should be \"i + idx >= cpuc->n_events\"\ninstead of \"i + idx > cpuc->n_events\" (it looks a typo). Otherwise,\nthe counter mask would traverse twice and an invalid \"cpuc->assign[1]\"\nbit (bit 0) is set into hw.config1 and cause MSR accessing error.\n\nBesides, also check if the ACR counter mask corresponding events are\nACR events. If not, filter out these counter mask. If a event is not a\nACR event, it could be scheduled to an HW counter which doesn't support\nACR. It's invalid to add their counter index in ACR counter mask.\n\nFurthermore, remove the WARN_ON_ONCE() since it's easily triggered as\nuser could set any invalid ACR counter mask and the warning message\ncould mislead users.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ec980e4facef8110f6fce27e5b6344660117f01f"},{"fixed":"c6cca4213b618c92e4972919ee568f0fb87313b1"},{"fixed":"43796f30507802d93ead2dc44fc9637f34671a89"}]}],"versions":["v6.15","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40122.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40122.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/43796f30507802d93ead2dc44fc9637f34671a89"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c6cca4213b618c92e4972919ee568f0fb87313b1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40122.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40122"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40122.json"}}
