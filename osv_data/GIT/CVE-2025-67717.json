Versions 2.44.0 through 3.4.4 and 4.0.0-rc.1 through 4.7.1 disclose the total number of instance users to authenticated users, regardless of their specific permissions. While this does not leak individual user data or PII, disclosing the total user count via the totalResult field constitutes an information disclosure vulnerability that may be sensitive in certain contexts.
