  "id": "CVE-2024-5334",
  "details": "A local file read vulnerability exists in the stitionai/devika repository, affecting the latest version. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the 'snapshot_path' parameter in the '/api/get-browser-snapshot' endpoint.

This issue impacts the security of the application by allowing unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.",
