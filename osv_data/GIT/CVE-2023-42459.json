{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-42459","published":"2023-10-16T20:56:04Z","modified":"2025-10-21T19:33:40Z","aliases":["GHSA-gq8g-fj58-22gm"],"summary":"Malformed DATA submessage leads to bad-free error in Fast-DDS","details":"Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group). In affected versions specific DATA submessages can be sent to a discovery locator which may trigger a free error. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process. The call to free() could potentially leave the pointer in the attackers control which could lead to a double free. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.12.0, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and 2.6.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/eprosima/fast-dds","events":[{"introduced":"64700fcb9058c14e3c7aeee0ec130c47c9824917"},{"last_affected":"e0067c8ea61ed6c5f200def0f0117acea9ec38cc"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/eprosima/fast-dds","events":[{"introduced":"463d59ca81c7fd732edf45b982a58c0b54fc1da4"},{"fixed":"5ac1dbacc7847f9bc080328930a7a8adcada2fe5"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/eprosima/fast-dds","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"125f90341a52d73abcfa5621f9bb51895cf44bbb"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-42459.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-gq8g-fj58-22gm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5568"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/pull/3824"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/issues/3207"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-415","CWE-416","CWE-590"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H"}]}
