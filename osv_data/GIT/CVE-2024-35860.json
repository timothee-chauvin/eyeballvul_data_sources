E.g., for\nmulti-kprobes and multi-uprobes, link is used to fetch BPF cookie values.\n\nBecause of this runtime dependency, when bpf_link refcnt drops to zero\nthere could still be active BPF programs running accessing link data.\n\nThis patch adds generic support to defer bpf_link dealloc callback to\nafter RCU GP, if requested. This is done by exposing two different\ndeallocation callbacks, one synchronous and one deferred. If deferred\none is provided, bpf_link_free() will schedule dealloc_deferred()\ncallback to happen after RCU GP.\n\nBPF is using two flavors of RCU: \"classic\" non-sleepable one and RCU\ntasks trace one. The latter is used when sleepable BPF programs are\nused. bpf_link_free() accommodates that by checking underlying BPF\nprogram's sleepable flag, and goes either through normal RCU GP only for\nnon-sleepable, or through RCU tasks trace GP *and* then normal RCU GP\n(taking into account rcu_trace_implies_rcu_gp() optimization), if BPF\nprogram is sleepable.\n\nWe use this for multi-kprobe and multi-uprobe links, which dereference\nlink during program run. We also preventively switch raw_tp link to use\ndeferred dealloc callback, as upcoming changes in bpf-next tree expose\nraw_tp link data (specifically, cookie value) to BPF program at runtime\nas well.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0dcac272540613d41c05e89679e4ddb978b612f1"},{"fixed":"876941f533e7b47fc69977fc4551c02f2d18af97"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0dcac272540613d41c05e89679e4ddb978b612f1"},{"fixed":"5d8d447777564b35f67000e7838e7ccb64d525c8"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0dcac272540613d41c05e89679e4ddb978b612f1"},{"fixed":"1a80dbcb2dbaf6e4c216e62e30fa7d3daa8001ce"}]}],"versions":["v5.17","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.3","v6.6.4","v6.6.5","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.8.1","v6.8.2","v6.8.3","v6.8.4","v6.9-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-35860.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.26"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.8.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-35860.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1a80dbcb2dbaf6e4c216e62e30fa7d3daa8001ce"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5d8d447777564b35f67000e7838e7ccb64d525c8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/876941f533e7b47fc69977fc4551c02f2d18af97"}]}
