{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-51649","published":"2023-12-22T16:48:19.711Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:22:19.811789Z","aliases":["GHSA-vf5m-xrhm-v999","PYSEC-2023-287"],"summary":"Nautobot missing object-level permissions enforcement when running Job Buttons","details":"Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. When submitting a Job to run via a Job Button, only the model-level `extras.run_job` permission is checked (i.e., does the user have permission to run Jobs in general). Object-level permissions (i.e., does the user have permission to run this specific Job?) are not enforced by the URL/view used in this case. A user with permissions to run even a single Job can actually run all configured JobButton Jobs. Fix will be available in Nautobot 1.6.8 and 2.1.0 ","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot","events":[{"introduced":"81e9b9dfedc23ff4ecb1ad8f46c907654faa9fa5"},{"fixed":"1beac0d45a7b195bc40042516c84ede716143217"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.5.14"},{"fixed":"1.6.8"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot","events":[{"introduced":"3013f25b41a1409adb815afb654fad4988f640ef"},{"fixed":"ff3c81de36af7d4eef2d63ecd74b0001e93ee701"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.1.0"}]}}],"versions":["v1.5.14","v1.5.15","v1.5.16","v1.5.17","v1.5.18","v1.5.19","v1.5.20","v1.5.21","v1.5.22","v1.5.23","v1.5.24","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc.1","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-51649.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4988"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4993"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4995"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-vf5m-xrhm-v999"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-863"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
