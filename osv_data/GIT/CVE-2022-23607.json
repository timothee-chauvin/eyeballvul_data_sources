Treq's request methods (`treq.get`, `treq.post`, etc.) and `treq.client.HTTPClient` constructor accept cookies as a dictionary. Such cookies are not bound to a single domain, and are therefore sent to *every* domain (\"supercookies\"). This can potentially cause sensitive information to leak upon an HTTP redirect to a different domain., e.g. should `https://example.com` redirect to `http://cloudstorageprovider.com` the latter will receive the cookie `session`. Treq 2021.1.0 and later bind cookies given to request methods (`treq.request`, `treq.get`, `HTTPClient.request`, `HTTPClient.get`, etc.) to the origin of the *url* parameter. Users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade Instead of passing a dictionary as the *cookies* argument, pass a `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` instance with properly domain- and scheme-scoped cookies in it.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/twisted/treq","events":[{"introduced":"606259031e17fb0cdd2143e11b988de525e89a3e"},{"fixed":"82f01e68e02bd52ddf09e352d73e0bcaff122727"}]}],"versions":["release-21.1.0","release-21.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23607.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/twisted/treq/security/advisories/GHSA-fhpf-pp6p-55qc"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00025.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
