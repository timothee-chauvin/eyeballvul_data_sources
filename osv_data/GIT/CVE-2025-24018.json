{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-24018","published":"2025-01-21T17:02:04.924Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:33:43.697196Z","aliases":["GHSA-w59h-3x3q-3p6j"],"summary":"YesWiki Vulnerable to Authenticated Stored XSS","details":"YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for an authenticated user with rights to edit/create a page or comment to trigger a stored XSS which will be reflected on any page where the resource is loaded. The vulnerability makes use of the content edition feature and more specifically of the `{{attach}}` component allowing users to attach files/medias to a page. When a file is attached using the `{{attach}}` component, if the resource contained in the `file` attribute doesn't exist, then the server will generate a file upload button containing the filename. This vulnerability allows any malicious authenticated user that has the right to create a comment or edit a page to be able to steal accounts and therefore modify pages, comments, permissions, extract user data (emails), thus impacting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a YesWiki instance. Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/yeswiki/yeswiki","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c840f08d23405dee81e7cfa28f6bc4ab6f9f4365"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-24018.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/blob/v4.4.5/tools/attach/libs/attach.lib.php#L660"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/commit/c1e28b59394957902c31c850219e4504a20db98b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-w59h-3x3q-3p6j"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L"}]}
