That commit also employed the logic in map\nfree path in its v6 version.\n\nLater bpf_cgrp_storage was first introduced in\nc4bcfb38a95e (\"bpf: Implement cgroup storage available to non-cgroup-attached bpf progs\")\nwhich faces the same issue as bpf_task_storage, instead of its busy\ncounter, NULL was passed to bpf_local_storage_map_free() which opened\na window to cause deadlock:\n\n\t<TASK>\n\t\t(acquiring local_storage->lock)\n\t_raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x3d/0x50\n\tbpf_local_storage_update+0xd1/0x460\n\tbpf_cgrp_storage_get+0x109/0x130\n\tbpf_prog_a4d4a370ba857314_cgrp_ptr+0x139/0x170\n\t? __bpf_prog_enter_recur+0x16/0x80\n\tbpf_trampoline_6442485186+0x43/0xa4\n\tcgroup_storage_ptr+0x9/0x20\n\t\t(holding local_storage->lock)\n\tbpf_selem_unlink_storage_nolock.constprop.0+0x135/0x160\n\tbpf_selem_unlink_storage+0x6f/0x110\n\tbpf_local_storage_map_free+0xa2/0x110\n\tbpf_map_free_deferred+0x5b/0x90\n\tprocess_one_work+0x17c/0x390\n\tworker_thread+0x251/0x360\n\tkthread+0xd2/0x100\n\tret_from_fork+0x34/0x50\n\tret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\t</TASK>\n\nProgs:\n - A: SEC(\"fentry/cgroup_storage_ptr\")\n   - cgid (BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH)\n\tRecord the id of the cgroup the current task belonging\n\tto in this hash map, using the address of the cgroup\n\tas the map key.\n   - cgrpa (BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGRP_STORAGE)\n\tIf current task is a kworker, lookup the above hash\n\tmap using function parameter @owner as the key to get\n\tits corresponding cgroup id which is then used to get\n\ta trusted pointer to the cgroup through\n\tbpf_cgroup_from_id().
