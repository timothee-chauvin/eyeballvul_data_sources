In Nim release versions before versions 1.2.10 and 1.4.4, \"nimble refresh\" fetches a list of Nimble packages over HTTPS by default. In case of error it falls back to a non-TLS URL http://irclogs.nim-lang.org/packages.json. An attacker able to perform MitM can deliver a modified package list containing malicious software packages. If the packages are installed and used the attack escalates to untrusted code execution.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nim-lang/nim","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ebc114c5266582dcaf5e323e0ec3d2b2a9f17063"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.2","v0.11.0","v0.11.2","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.14.2","v0.15.0","v0.15.2","v0.16.0","v0.17.0","v0.17.2","v0.18.0","v0.19.0","v0.20.0","v0.8.14","v0.9.0","v0.9.2","v0.9.4","v0.9.6","v1.0.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.2","v1.2.4","v1.2.6","v1.2.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-21373.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://consensys.net/diligence/vulnerabilities/nim-insecure-ssl-tls-defaults-remote-code-execution/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble/blob/master/changelog.markdown#0130"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nim-lang/security/security/advisories/GHSA-8w52-r35x-rgp8"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
