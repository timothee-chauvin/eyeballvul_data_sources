{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-4287","published":"2024-05-20T13:15:23Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:35:25Z","details":"In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, a vulnerability exists due to improper input validation in the workspace update process. Specifically, the application fails to validate or format JSON data sent in an HTTP POST request to `/api/workspace/:workspace-slug/update`, allowing it to be executed as part of a database query without restrictions. This flaw enables users with a manager role to craft a request that includes nested write operations, effectively allowing them to create new Administrator accounts.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"94b58249a37a21b1c08deaa2d1edfdecbb6deb18"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-4287.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/34491fb7-5133-4e80-8782-74124350bbdb"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/94b58249a37a21b1c08deaa2d1edfdecbb6deb18"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
