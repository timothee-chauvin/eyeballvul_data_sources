{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-24724","published":"2022-03-03T19:35:09Z","modified":"2025-11-19T10:57:19.670672Z","aliases":["GHSA-mc3g-88wq-6f4x"],"related":["ALSA-2022:5597"],"summary":"Integer overflow in table parsing extension leads to heap memory corruption","details":"cmark-gfm is GitHub's extended version of the C reference implementation of CommonMark. Prior to versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21, an integer overflow in cmark-gfm's table row parsing `table.c:row_from_string` may lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables who's marker rows contain more than UINT16_MAX columns. The impact of this heap corruption ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how and where `cmark-gfm` is used. If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote user controlled markdown, this vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in applications employing affected versions of the `cmark-gfm` library. This vulnerability has been patched in the following cmark-gfm versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21. A workaround is available. The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions of cmark-gfm. Disabling the table extension will prevent this vulnerability from being triggered.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6fc5672293c1052e2fb7ab65a92a41495cb6426a"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.28.3.gfm.21"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm","events":[{"introduced":"b8eb2e00de094999f978e9cb02b1a78d810812d3"},{"fixed":"cf7577d2f74289cb83de0a652afc1a8b08a37036"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0.29.0.gfm.0"},{"fixed":"0.29.0.gfm.3"}]}}],"versions":["0.27.1.gfm.2","0.27.1.gfm.3","0.27.1.gfm.4","0.28.0.gfm.10","0.28.0.gfm.11","0.28.0.gfm.5","0.28.0.gfm.6","0.28.0.gfm.7","0.28.0.gfm.8","0.28.0.gfm.9","0.28.3.gfm.12","0.28.3.gfm.13","0.28.3.gfm.14","0.28.3.gfm.15","0.28.3.gfm.16","0.28.3.gfm.17","0.28.3.gfm.18","0.28.3.gfm.19","0.28.3.gfm.20","0.29.0.gfm.0","0.29.0.gfm.1","0.29.0.gfm.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24724.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166599/cmark-gfm-Integer-overflow.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-mc3g-88wq-6f4x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5CYUU662VO6CCXQKVZVOHXX3RGIF2DLQ/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F7V3HAM5H6YFJG2QFEXACZR3XVWFTXTC/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KH4UQA6VWVZU5EW3HNEAB7D7BTCNJSJ2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RSKUOJ2VAYGTJXPDE2RRPMNLVVMKCI77/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TJBFIJEHJZEEDG6MO4MQHZYKUXELH77O/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z55K6VNVKO2G5SNKRCQ2KDG5SKTX5PVV/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-190"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
