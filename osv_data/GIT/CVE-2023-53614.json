{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53614","published":"2025-10-04T15:44:21.671Z","modified":"2025-12-05T03:20:30.106865Z","summary":"mm/ksm: fix race with VMA iteration and mm_struct teardown","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/ksm: fix race with VMA iteration and mm_struct teardown\n\nexit_mmap() will tear down the VMAs and maple tree with the mmap_lock held\nin write mode.  Ensure that the maple tree is still valid by checking\nksm_test_exit() after taking the mmap_lock in read mode, but before the\nfor_each_vma() iterator dereferences a destroyed maple tree.\n\nSince the maple tree is destroyed, the flags telling lockdep to check an\nexternal lock has been cleared.  Skip the for_each_vma() iterator to avoid\ndereferencing a maple tree without the external lock flag, which would\ncreate a lockdep warning.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a5f18ba0727656bd1fe3bcdb0d563f81790f9a04"},{"fixed":"286b0cab31bac29960e5684f6fb331d42f03b363"},{"fixed":"b4f664ffd8f78c05a1fd542a28bc5a11e994c014"},{"fixed":"6db504ce55bdbc575723938fc480713c9183f6a2"}]}],"versions":["v6.0","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4","v6.2.5","v6.2.6","v6.2.7","v6.2.8","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53614.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.1.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.22"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53614.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/286b0cab31bac29960e5684f6fb331d42f03b363"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6db504ce55bdbc575723938fc480713c9183f6a2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b4f664ffd8f78c05a1fd542a28bc5a11e994c014"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53614.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53614"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53614.json"}}
