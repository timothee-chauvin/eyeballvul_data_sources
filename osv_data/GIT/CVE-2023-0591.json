By crafting a malicious UBIFS file with node names holding path traversal payloads (e.g. ../../tmp/outside.txt), it's possible to force ubi_reader to write outside of the extraction directory.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects ubi-reader before 0.8.5.\n\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jrspruitt/ubi_reader","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"26c41bd1b63417e2eef07db2281b21f9a94d0fab"}]}],"versions":["v0.5.0-master","v0.6.2-master","v0.6.2-testing","v0.6.3-master","v0.7.1-master","v0.7.2-master","v0.8.0-master","v1_ui","v2_ui"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-0591.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jrspruitt/ubi_reader/pull/57"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://onekey.com/blog/security-advisory-remote-command-execution-in-binwalk/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
