They are just zero cleared. The function\nmpi3mr_complete_evt_ack() refers host_tag field of the elements. Due to the\nzero value of the host_tag field, the function calls clear_bit() for\nmrico->evtack_cmds_bitmap with wrong bit index. This results in memory\naccess to invalid address and \"BUG: KASAN: use-after-free\". This BUG was\nobserved at eHBA-9600 firmware update to version 8.3.1.0. To fix it, add\nthe missing initialization of mrioc->evtack_cmds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"c1af985d27da2d530c22604644e9025810f57d7c"},{"fixed":"4e0dfdb48a824deac3dfbc67fb856ef2aee13529"},{"fixed":"67989091e11a974003ddf2ec39bc613df8eadd83"},{"fixed":"e39ea831ebad4ab15c4748cb62a397a8abcca36e"}]}],"versions":["v5.16","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.2.1","v6.2.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54234.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.16"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54234.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4e0dfdb48a824deac3dfbc67fb856ef2aee13529"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/67989091e11a974003ddf2ec39bc613df8eadd83"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e39ea831ebad4ab15c4748cb62a397a8abcca36e"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54234.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54234"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54234.json"}}
