In versions 1.0.0 to 1.6.1 and 2.0.0 to 2.3.4, the input parameter, which consists of a file path and name, can be manipulated to return the Content-Type header with text/html if the name part ends with .html. This could allow malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the browser. For a successful attack, a malicious file needs to be uploaded beforehand. This issue has been patched in versions 1.6.2 and 2.4.0. A workaround is provided on the Jmix documentation website.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix","events":[{"introduced":"4e74c686d499f122268a8321cc841b371f27efb9"},{"fixed":"79107528c363c9694f2a1f94ec4d9b891ea9d3d9"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.0.0"},{"fixed":"1.6.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix","events":[{"introduced":"589855d1261df79199b81e955791173500e070f9"},{"fixed":"10bcf8389857343eccd4aa1595ccce0416382881"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.4.0"}]}}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-32951.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html#disable-files-endpoint-in-jmix-application"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/32xxx/CVE-2025-32951.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/commit/6a66aa3adb967159a30d703e80403406f4c8f7a2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/commit/c589ef4e2b25620770b8036f4ad05f1a6250cb6a"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/commit/cc97e6ff974b9e7af8160fab39cc5866169daa37"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/commit/f4e6fb05bd245cf36f3e9319aaa0fcd540d024aa"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3804"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3836"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/security/advisories/GHSA-x27v-f838-jh93"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32951"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/32xxx/CVE-2025-32951.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
