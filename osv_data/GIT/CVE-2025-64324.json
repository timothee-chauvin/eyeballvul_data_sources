{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-64324","published":"2025-11-18T22:10:19.661Z","modified":"2025-11-20T19:53:50.141841Z","aliases":["GHSA-46xp-26xh-hpqh","GO-2025-4110"],"summary":"KubeVirt Vulnerable to Arbitrary Host File Read and Write","details":"KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. The `hostDisk` feature in KubeVirt allows mounting a host file or directory owned by the user with UID 107 into a VM. However, prior to version 1.6.1 and 1.7.0, the implementation of this feature and more specifically the `DiskOrCreate` option (which creates a file if it doesn't exist) has a logic bug that allows an attacker to read and write arbitrary files owned by more privileged users on the host system. Versions 1.6.1 and 1.7.0 fix the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"00d03e43e3bf03e563136695a4732b65ed42d764"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.1"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt","events":[{"introduced":"d347811ba84f31aaea00b6e36dcf1ddaa6687034"},{"fixed":"cd2805cb993960b24634a021dca991814801808d"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.7.0-alpha.0"},{"fixed":"1.7.0-rc.0"}]}}],"versions":["v0.0.1-alpha.0","v0.0.1-alpha.1","v0.0.1-alpha.2","v0.0.1-alpha.3","v0.0.1-alpha.4","v0.0.1-alpha.5","v0.0.1-alpha.6","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.1.0","v0.1.0-alpha","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.12.0","v0.12.0-alpha.0","v0.12.0-alpha.1","v0.12.0-alpha.2","v0.12.0-alpha.3","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.15.0","v0.15.0-alpha.0","v0.16.0","v0.16.0-alpha.0","v0.17.0","v0.17.0-alpha.0","v0.17.0-alpha.1","v0.18.0","v0.19.0","v0.19.0-rc.0","v0.2.0","v0.20.0","v0.21.0","v0.22.0","v0.23.0","v0.24.0","v0.25.0","v0.25.0-rc.0","v0.26.0","v0.26.0-rc.0","v0.26.1","v0.27.0","v0.27.0-rc.0","v0.28.0","v0.28.0-rc.0","v0.28.0-rc.1","v0.28.0-rc.2","v0.29.0","v0.29.0-rc.0","v0.29.0-rc.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.0-alpha.0","v0.3.0-alpha.1","v0.3.0-alpha.2","v0.3.0-alpha.3","v0.3.0-alpha.4","v0.30.0","v0.30.0-rc.0","v0.30.0-rc.1","v0.30.0-rc.2","v0.30.0-rc.3","v0.30.0-rc.4","v0.31.0","v0.31.0-rc.1","v0.32.0-rc.1","v0.33.0-rc.0","v0.34.0-rc.0","v0.35.0","v0.35.0-rc.0","v0.36.0-rc.0","v0.37.0-rc.0","v0.38.0","v0.38.0-rc.0","v0.39.0-rc.0","v0.4.0","v0.4.0-alpha.0","v0.4.0-alpha.1","v0.4.0-alpha.2","v0.4.1","v0.4.1-alpha.1","v0.4.1-alpha.2","v0.40.0-rc.0","v0.41.0-rc.0","v0.42.0","v0.42.0-rc.0","v0.43.0-rc.0","v0.43.1-rc.1","v0.44.0","v0.44.0-rc.0","v0.45.0","v0.45.0-rc.0","v0.46.0","v0.46.0-rc.0","v0.47.0-rc.0","v0.48.0","v0.48.0-rc.0","v0.49.0","v0.49.0-rc.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.0-alpha.0","v0.5.0-alpha.1","v0.5.1-alpha.1","v0.5.1-alpha.2","v0.5.1-alpha.3","v0.50.0","v0.50.0-rc.0","v0.51.0","v0.51.0-rc.0","v0.52.0","v0.52.0-rc.0","v0.53.0","v0.53.0-rc.0","v0.54.0","v0.54.0-rc.0","v0.55.0","v0.55.0-rc.0","v0.56.0-rc.0","v0.57.0","v0.57.0-rc.0","v0.58.0","v0.58.0-rc.0","v0.59.0-alpha.0","v0.59.0-alpha.1","v0.59.0-alpha.2","v0.59.0-rc.0","v0.59.0-rc.1","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.1-alpha.0","v0.60.0-alpha.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.0-alpha.0","v0.7.0-alpha.1","v0.7.0-alpha.2","v0.7.0-alpha.3","v0.7.0-alpha.4","v0.7.0-alpha.5","v0.8.0","v0.8.0-alpha.0","v0.8.0-alpha.1","v0.8.0-alpha.2","v0.9.0","v0.9.0-alpha.0","v0.9.0-alpha.1","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v1.0.0-alpha.0","v1.0.0-beta.0","v1.1.0-alpha.0","v1.1.0-rc.0","v1.2.0-alpha.0","v1.2.0-beta.0","v1.2.0-rc.0","v1.3.0-alpha.0","v1.3.0-beta.0","v1.4.0-alpha.0","v1.4.0-alpha.1","v1.4.0-rc.0","v1.5.0-alpha.0","v1.5.0-beta.0","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-alpha.0","v1.6.0-beta.0","v1.6.0-rc.0","v1.6.0-rc.1","v1.7.0-alpha.0","v1.7.0-beta.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64324.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/commit/00d03e43e3bf03e563136695a4732b65ed42d764"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/commit/ff3b69b08b6b9c8d08d23735ca8d82455f790a69"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/15037"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/security/advisories/GHSA-46xp-26xh-hpqh"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200","CWE-732"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
