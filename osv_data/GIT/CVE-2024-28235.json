Starting in version 4.9.0 and prior to versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4, when checking for broken links on protected pages, Contao sends the cookie header to external urls as well, the passed  options for the http client are used for all requests. Contao versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4 have a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable crawling protected pages.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/contao/contao","events":[{"introduced":"23899ad910aa057494cce4517015aa31faa37f11"},{"fixed":"1789b18b3d2b56c0dd17dc45e870c472a47d536f"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"4.9.0"},{"fixed":"4.13.40"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/contao/contao","events":[{"introduced":"d42d220274c313eff0f0b25d1e1725b8aae0353a"},{"fixed":"7f2565d37bd7e4800193b902fe39c9790fb01c5b"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"5.0.0-RC1"},{"fixed":"5.3.4"}]}}],"versions":["4.10.0","4.10.0-RC1","4.10.0-RC2","4.10.0-RC3","4.10.0-RC4","4.10.1","4.10.2","4.10.3","4.10.4","4.10.5","4.10.6","4.10.7","4.11.0","4.11.0-RC1","4.11.0-RC2","4.11.1","4.11.2","4.11.3","4.11.4","4.11.5","4.11.6","4.11.7","4.11.8","4.11.9","4.12.0","4.12.0-RC1","4.12.0-RC2","4.12.0-RC3","4.12.1","4.12.2","4.12.3","4.12.4","4.12.5","4.12.6","4.12.7","4.13.0","4.13.0-RC1","4.13.0-RC2","4.13.0-RC3","4.13.1","4.13.10","4.13.11","4.13.12","4.13.13","4.13.14","4.13.15","4.13.16","4.13.17","4.13.18","4.13.19","4.13.2","4.13.20","4.13.21","4.13.22","4.13.23","4.13.24","4.13.25","4.13.26","4.13.27","4.13.28","4.13.29","4.13.3","4.13.30","4.13.31","4.13.32","4.13.33","4.13.34","4.13.35","4.13.36","4.13.37","4.13.38","4.13.39","4.13.4","4.13.5","4.13.6","4.13.7","4.13.8","4.13.9","4.4.48","4.4.49","4.4.50","4.4.51","4.4.52","4.4.53","4.4.54","4.4.55","4.9.0","4.9.1","4.9.10","4.9.11","4.9.12","4.9.13","4.9.14","4.9.15","4.9.16","4.9.17","4.9.18","4.9.19","4.9.2","4.9.20","4.9.21","4.9.22","4.9.23","4.9.24","4.9.25","4.9.26","4.9.27","4.9.28","4.9.29","4.9.3","4.9.30","4.9.31","4.9.32","4.9.33","4.9.34","4.9.35","4.9.36","4.9.37","4.9.38","4.9.39","4.9.4","4.9.40","4.9.41","4.9.5","4.9.6","4.9.7","4.9.8","4.9.9","5.0.0","5.0.0-RC1","5.0.0-RC2","5.0.0-RC3","5.0.0-RC4","5.0.1","5.0.10","5.0.2","5.0.3","5.0.4","5.0.5","5.0.6","5.0.7","5.0.8","5.0.9","5.1.0","5.1.0-RC1","5.1.0-RC2","5.1.0-RC3","5.1.1","5.1.10","5.1.11","5.1.2","5.1.3","5.1.4","5.1.5","5.1.6","5.1.7","5.1.8","5.1.9","5.2.0","5.2.0-RC1","5.2.0-RC2","5.2.0-RC3","5.2.0-RC4","5.2.0-RC5","5.2.0-RC6","5.2.1","5.2.10","5.2.2","5.2.3","5.2.4","5.2.5","5.2.6","5.2.7","5.2.8","5.2.9","5.3.0","5.3.0-RC1","5.3.0-RC2","5.3.0-RC3","5.3.0-RC4","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-28235.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://contao.org/en/security-advisories/session-cookie-disclosure-in-the-crawler"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/contao/contao/blob/14e9ef4bc8b82936ba2d0e04164581145a075e2a/core-bundle/src/Resources/contao/classes/Crawl.php#L129"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/contao/contao/commit/73a2770e2d3535ec9f1b03d54be00e56ebb8ff16"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/contao/contao/commit/79b7620d01ce8f46ce2b331455e0d95e5208de3d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/contao/contao/security/advisories/GHSA-9jh5-qf84-x6pr"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
