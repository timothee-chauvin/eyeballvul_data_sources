Starting in the 2.x branch and prior to versions 2.0.1 and 3.0.1, when the `++api++` traverser is accidentally used multiple times in a url, handling it takes increasingly longer, making the server less responsive. Patches are available in `plone.rest` 2.0.1 and 3.0.1.  Series 1.x is not affected. As a workaround, one may redirect `/++api++/++api++` to `/++api++` in one's frontend web server (nginx, Apache).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/plone/plone.rest","events":[{"introduced":"3dd6627e76e4a115448c3edf37a7ae257740ea64"},{"fixed":"2a3f97468ba798e7a0e6aa4156578939e0fc4734"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/plone/plone.rest","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"dc7dd0003d39adcd0ca15a592e7e14a7c4af216f"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0a1","1.0a2","1.0a3","1.0a4","1.0a5","1.0a6","1.0a7","1.0b1","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","2.0.0","2.0.0a1","2.0.0a2","2.0.0a3","2.0.0a4","2.0.0a5","3.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-42457.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/security/advisories/GHSA-h6rp-mprm-xgcq"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/commit/43b4a7e86206e237e1de5ca3817ed071575882f7"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/commit/77846a9842889b24f35e8bedc2e9d461388d3302"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400","CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
