If bond\nmode is changed after attaching xdp program, the warning may occur.\n\nSome bond modes (broadcast, etc.) do not support native xdp. Set bond mode\nwith xdp program attached is not good. Add check for xdp program when set\nbond mode.\n\n    [1]\n    ------------[ cut here ]------------\n    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 11 at net/core/dev.c:9912 unregister_netdevice_many_notify+0x8d9/0x930\n    Modules linked in:\n    CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 11 Comm: kworker/u4:0 Not tainted 6.14.0-rc4 #107\n    Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.15.0-0-g2dd4b9b3f840-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n    Workqueue: netns cleanup_net\n    RIP: 0010:unregister_netdevice_many_notify+0x8d9/0x930\n    Code: 00 00 48 c7 c6 6f e3 a2 82 48 c7 c7 d0 b3 96 82 e8 9c 10 3e ...\n    RSP: 0018:ffffc90000063d80 EFLAGS: 00000282\n    RAX: 00000000ffffffa1 RBX: ffff888004959000 RCX: 00000000ffffdfff\n    RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 00000000ffffffea RDI: ffffc90000063b48\n    RBP: ffffc90000063e28 R08: ffffffff82d39b28 R09: 0000000000009ffb\n    R10: 0000000000000175 R11: ffffffff82d09b40 R12: ffff8880049598e8\n    R13: 0000000000000001 R14: dead000000000100 R15: ffffc90000045000\n    FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff888007a00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n    CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n    CR2: 000000000d406b60 CR3: 000000000483e000 CR4: 00000000000006f0\n    Call Trace:\n     <TASK>\n     ? __warn+0x83/0x130\n     ? unregister_netdevice_many_notify+0x8d9/0x930\n     ? report_bug+0x18e/0x1a0\n     ? handle_bug+0x54/0x90\n     ? exc_invalid_op+0x18/0x70\n     ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n     ? unregister_netdevice_many_notify+0x8d9/0x930\n     ? bond_net_exit_batch_rtnl+0x5c/0x90\n     cleanup_net+0x237/0x3d0\n     process_one_work+0x163/0x390\n     worker_thread+0x293/0x3b0\n     ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n     kthread+0xec/0x1e0\n     ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n     ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n     ret_from_fork+0x2f/0x50\n     ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n     ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n     </TASK>\n    ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9e2ee5c7e7c35d195e2aa0692a7241d47a433d1e"},{"fixed":"0dd4fac43bdea23cfe4bb2a3eabb76d752ac32fb"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9e2ee5c7e7c35d195e2aa0692a7241d47a433d1e"},{"fixed":"094ee6017ea09c11d6af187935a949df32803ce0"}]}],"versions":["v5.14","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.14.1","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-22105.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.15.0"},{"fixed":"6.14.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-22105.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/094ee6017ea09c11d6af187935a949df32803ce0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0dd4fac43bdea23cfe4bb2a3eabb76d752ac32fb"}]}
