If bond\nmode is changed after attaching xdp program, the warning may occur.\n\nSome bond modes (broadcast, etc.) do not support native xdp. Set bond mode\nwith xdp program attached is not good. Add check for xdp program when set\nbond mode.\n\n    [1]\n    ------------[ cut here ]------------\n    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 11 at net/core/dev.c:9912 unregister_netdevice_many_notify+0x8d9/0x930\n
