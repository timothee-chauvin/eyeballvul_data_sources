Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 5.0.2, the `env` and `expandenv` template functions which is enabled by default in Sprig enables capturing of env variables on host. While this may not be a problem on single-user (super admin) installations, on multi-user installations, this allows non-super-admin users with campaign or template permissions to use the `{{ env }}` template expression to capture sensitive environment variables. Users should upgrade to v5.0.2 to mitigate the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/knadh/listmonk","events":[{"introduced":"3894571d1ac0b5baa5bcb15a173e4e1020d7a113"},{"fixed":"d27d2c32cf3af2d0b24e29ea5a686ba149b49b3e"}]}],"versions":["v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.1.0","v5.0.0","v5.0.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-49136.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/commit/d27d2c32cf3af2d0b24e29ea5a686ba149b49b3e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/releases/tag/v5.0.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/security/advisories/GHSA-jc7g-x28f-3v3h"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1336"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
