In affected versions an integer overflow in `freerdp_bitmap_planar_context_reset` leads to heap-buffer overflow. This affects FreeRDP based clients. FreeRDP based server implementations and proxy are not affected. A malicious server could prepare a `RDPGFX_RESET_GRAPHICS_PDU` to allocate too small buffers, possibly triggering later out of bound read/write. Data extraction over network is not possible, the buffers are used to display an image. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.5 and 3.2.0. Users are advised to upgrade. there are no know workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freerdp/freerdp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f1121b0812f992918b56998df8141ea0ca785def"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.5"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freerdp/freerdp","events":[{"introduced":"a34fa7c49d2a39aa49ace1d7bea9656912d8c7cb"},{"fixed":"bb87d4ca5072c40e83ed92130a6674bf245d1f2f"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.0.0"},{"fixed":"3.2.0"}]}}],"versions":["1.0-beta1","1.0-beta2","1.0-beta3","1.0-beta4","1.0-beta5","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0-beta+2013071101","1.1.0-beta1","1.1.0-beta1+android2","1.1.0-beta1+android3","1.1.0-beta1+android4","1.1.0-beta1+android5","1.1.0-beta1+ios1","1.1.0-beta1+ios2","1.1.0-beta1+ios3","1.1.0-beta1+ios4","1.2.0-beta1+android7","1.2.0-beta1+android9","2.0.0","2.0.0-beta1+android10","2.0.0-beta1+android11","2.0.0-rc0","2.0.0-rc1","2.0.0-rc2","2.0.0-rc3","2.0.0-rc4","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.10.0","2.11.0","2.11.1","2.11.2","2.11.3","2.11.4","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.4.1","2.5.0","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.9.0","3.0.0","3.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-22211.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/commit/939e922936e9c3ae8fc204968645e5e7563a2fff"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/commit/aeac3040cc99eeaff1e1171a822114c857b9dca9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/security/advisories/GHSA-rjhp-44rv-7v59"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/02/msg00016.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/44VOA5KQQT7KQPW7CLST4Y4SQTKK3IOU/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PIQE3YSPOJPAUS7DPWIBTR5IQSQX35VM/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-122","CWE-190"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"}]}
