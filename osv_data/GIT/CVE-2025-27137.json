{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-27137","published":"2025-02-24T20:59:50Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:36:04.538388Z","related":["GHSA-9582-88hr-54w3","GHSA-p75g-cxfj-7wrx"],"summary":"Dependency-Track vulnerable to local file inclusion via custom notification templates","details":"Dependency-Track is a component analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Dependency-Track allows users with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to customize notification templates. Templates are evaluated using the Pebble template engine. Pebble supports an `include` tag, which allows template authors to include the content of arbitrary files upon evaluation. Prior to version 4.12.6, users of Dependency-Track with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission can abuse the `include` tag by crafting notification templates that `include` sensitive local files, such as `/etc/passwd` or `/proc/1/environ`. By configuring such a template for a notification rule (aka \"Alert\"), and having it send notifications to a destination controlled by the actor, sensitive information may be leaked. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.12.6. In fixed versions, the `include` tag can no longer be used. Usage of the tag will cause template evaluation to fail. As a workaround, avoid assigning the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to untrusted users. The `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission per default is only granted to members of the `Administrators` team. Assigning this permission to non-administrative users or teams is a security risk in itself, and highly discouraged.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dependencytrack/dependency-track","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6036df74a382a2e1be64c7c808c6c46946cbed60"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.12.6"}]}}],"versions":["3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.4.0","3.4.1","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.6.0","3.6.1","3.7.0","3.7.1","3.8.0","4.0.0","4.0.0-SNAPSHOT","4.0.0-beta.1","4.0.0-beta.2","4.0.0-beta.3","4.0.0-beta.4","4.0.0-rc.1","4.0.1","4.1.0","4.10.0","4.11.0","4.12.0","4.12.1","4.12.2","4.12.3","4.12.4","4.12.5","4.2.0","4.2.1","4.2.2","4.3.0","4.3.1","4.3.2","4.3.3","4.3.4","4.3.5","4.3.6","4.4.0","4.4.1","4.4.2","4.5.0","4.6.0","4.7.0","4.8.0","4.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27137.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/4684"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/4685"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/security/advisories/GHSA-9582-88hr-54w3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-p75g-cxfj-7wrx"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/issues/680"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pebbletemplates.io/wiki/tag/include"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-73"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
