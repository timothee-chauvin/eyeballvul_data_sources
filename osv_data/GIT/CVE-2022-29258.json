{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-29258","published":"2022-05-31T16:45:11Z","modified":"2025-12-04T10:22:22.961460Z","aliases":["GHSA-xjfw-5vv5-vjq2"],"summary":"Cross-site Scripting in Filter Stream Converter Application in XWiki Platform","details":"XWiki Platform Filter UI provides a generic user interface to convert from a XWiki Filter input stream to an output stream with settings for each stream. Starting with versions 6.0-milestone-2 and 5.4.4 and prior to versions 12.10.11, 14.0-rc-1, 13.4.7, and 13.10.3, XWiki Platform Filter UI contains a possible cross-site scripting vector in the `Filter.FilterStreamDescriptorForm` wiki page related to pretty much all the form fields printed in the home page of the application. The issue is patched in versions 12.10.11, 14.0-rc-1, 13.4.7, and 13.10.3. The easiest workaround is to edit the wiki page `Filter.FilterStreamDescriptorForm` (with wiki editor) according to the instructions in the GitHub Security Advisory.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons","events":[{"introduced":"a1d7264bf87daf0a38602647504fe0590bd11ed5"},{"fixed":"75e8654651969f3f8c27a7747939b1ce1a3a3422"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-29258.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"21906acb5ee2304552f56f9bbdbf8e7d368f7f3a"}]}],"versions":["xwiki-application-calendar-1.0","xwiki-platform-7.3-milestone-2","xwiki-platform-7.4-milestone-1","xwiki-platform-7.4-milestone-2","xwiki-platform-8.0-milestone-1","xwiki-platform-8.0-milestone-2","xwiki-platform-8.1-milestone-1","xwiki-platform-8.1-milestone-2","xwiki-platform-8.2-milestone-1","xwiki-platform-8.2-milestone-2","xwiki-platform-8.3-milestone-1","xwiki-platform-9.9-rc-2","xwiki-plugin-tag-1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-29258.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/29xxx/CVE-2022-29258.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/21906acb5ee2304552f56f9bbdbf8e7d368f7f3a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-xjfw-5vv5-vjq2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19293"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29258"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-116","CWE-80"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/29xxx/CVE-2022-29258.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
