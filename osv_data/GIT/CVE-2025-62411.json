{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62411","published":"2025-10-16T17:50:28.184Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:21:39.074642Z","aliases":["GHSA-frc6-pwgr-c28w"],"summary":"Stored XSS in Alert Transport name field in LibreNMS","details":"LibreNMS  is a community-based GPL-licensed network monitoring system. LibreNMS <= 25.8.0 contains a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Alert Transports management functionality. When an administrator creates a new Alert Transport, the value of the Transport name field is stored and later rendered in the Transports column of the Alert Rules page without proper input validation or output encoding. This leads to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the admin’s browser. This vulnerability is fixed in 25.10.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7393c0337c12166b3a95485a9e805b4c9a88239f"}]}],"versions":["0.1","1.19","1.20","1.21","1.25","1.26","1.27","1.28","1.29","1.30","1.30.01","1.31","1.31.01","1.31.02","1.31.03","1.32","1.33","1.35","1.36","1.37","1.38","1.39","1.40","1.41","1.42","1.42.01","1.43","1.44","1.45","1.46","1.47","1.48","1.48.1","1.49","1.50","1.51","1.52","1.53","1.53.1","1.54","1.55","1.56","1.57","1.58","1.58.1","1.59","1.60","1.61","1.62","1.63","1.64","1.64.1","1.65","1.66","1.67","1.68","1.69","1.70.0","1.70.1","201505","201506","201507","201508","201509","201510","201511","201512","201601","201602","201603","201604","201605","201606","201607","201608","20160828","201609","21.1.0","21.10.0","21.11.0","21.12.0","21.12.1","21.2.0","21.3.0","21.4.0","21.5.0","21.5.1","21.6.0","21.7.0","21.8.0","21.9.0","22.1.0","22.10.0","22.11.0","22.12.0","22.2.0","22.2.1","22.3.0","22.4.0","22.5.0","22.6.0","22.7.0","22.8.0","22.9.0","23.1.0","23.10.0","23.11.0","23.2.0","23.4.0","23.4.1","23.5.0","23.6.0","23.7.0","23.8.0","23.8.1","23.8.2","23.9.0","23.9.1","24.1.0","24.10.0","24.10.1","24.11.0","24.12.0","24.2.0","24.3.0","24.4.0","24.4.1","24.5.0","24.6.0","24.7.0","24.8.0","24.9.0","24.9.1","25.1.0","25.2.0","25.3.0","25.4.0","25.5.0","25.6.0","25.7.0","25.8.0","25.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62411.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/62xxx/CVE-2025-62411.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/706a77085f4d5964f7de9444208ef707e1f79450"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-frc6-pwgr-c28w"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62411"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/62xxx/CVE-2025-62411.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
