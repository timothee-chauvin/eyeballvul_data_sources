{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-28098","published":"2023-03-15T22:11:01Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:36:35.979541Z","aliases":["GHSA-jrqg-vppj-hr2h"],"summary":"OpenSIPS has vulnerability in the Digest Authentication Parser","details":"OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, a specially crafted Authorization header causes OpenSIPS to crash or behave in an unexpected way due to a bug in the function `parse_param_name()` . This issue was discovered while performing coverage guided fuzzing of the function parse_msg. The AddressSanitizer identified that the issue occurred in the function `q_memchr()` which is being called by the function `parse_param_name()`. This issue may cause erratic program behaviour or a server crash. It affects configurations containing\nfunctions that make use of the affected code, such as the function `www_authorize()` . Versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4 contain a fix.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opensips/opensips","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c4122c9860458616cb438795c3545cd0f6014927"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opensips/opensips","events":[{"introduced":"1e94abe8837fe3511fada132d67a6385d8d099a2"},{"fixed":"50407d34067f0e80765617c3bace78639e380d5a"}]}],"versions":["1.11.0","2.1-alpha1","2.1-alpha2","2.1-alpha3","2.1-rc1","3.1.0","3.1.0-beta","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.1.4","3.1.5","3.1.6","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-28098.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-jrqg-vppj-hr2h"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/dd9141b6f67d7df4072f3430f628d4b73df5e102"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
