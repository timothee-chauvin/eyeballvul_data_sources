In this case, the second write\nmay be subject to speculative store bypass (SSB) creating a\nspeculative pointer-as-scalar type confusion. This allows the\nprogram to subsequently leak the numerical pointer value using,\nfor example, a branch-based cache side channel.\n\nTo fix this, also sanitize scalars if they write a stack slot\nthat previously contained a pointer. Assuming that pointer-spills\nare only generated by LLVM on register-pressure, the performance\nimpact on most real-world BPF programs should be small.\n\nThe following unprivileged BPF bytecode drafts a minimal exploit\nand the mitigation:\n\n  [...]\n  // r6 = 0 or 1 (skalar, unknown user input)\n  // r7 = accessible ptr for side channel\n  // r10 = frame pointer (fp), to be leaked\n  //\n  r9 = r10 # fp alias to encourage ssb\n  *(u64 *)(r9 - 8) = r10 // fp[-8] = ptr, to be leaked\n  // lfence added here because of pointer spill to stack.\n  //\n  // Ommitted: Dummy bpf_ringbuf_output() here to train alias predictor\n  // for no r9-r10 dependency.\n  //\n  *(u64 *)(r10 - 8) = r6 // fp[-8] = scalar, overwrites ptr\n  // 2039f26f3aca: no lfence added because stack slot was not STACK_INVALID,\n  // store may be subject to SSB\n  //\n  // fix: also add an lfence when the slot contained a ptr\n  //\n  r8 = *(u64 *)(r9 - 8)\n  // r8 = architecturally a scalar, speculatively a ptr\n  //\n  // leak ptr using branch-based cache side channel:\n  r8 &= 1 // choose bit to leak\n  if r8 == 0 goto SLOW // no mispredict\n  // architecturally dead code if input r6 is 0,\n  // only executes speculatively iff ptr bit is 1\n  r8 = *(u64 *)(r7 + 0) # encode bit in cache (0: slow, 1: fast)\nSLOW:\n  [...]\n\nAfter running this, the program can time the access to *(r7 + 0) to\ndetermine whether the chosen pointer bit was 0 or 1. Repeat this 64\ntimes to recover the whole address on amd64.\n\nIn summary, sanitization can only be skipped if one scalar is\noverwritten with another scalar. Scalar-confusion due to speculative\nstore bypass can not lead to invalid accesses because the pointer\nbounds deducted during verification are enforced using branchless\nlogic. See 979d63d50c0c (\"bpf: prevent out of bounds speculation on\npointer arithmetic\") for details.\n\nDo not make the mitigation depend on !env->allow_{uninit_stack,ptr_leaks}\nbecause speculative leaks are likely unexpected if these were enabled.\nFor example, leaking the address to a protected log file may be acceptable\nwhile disabling the mitigation might unintentionally leak the address\ninto the cached-state of a map that is accessible to
