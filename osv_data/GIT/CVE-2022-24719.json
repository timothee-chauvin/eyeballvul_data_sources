Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing. The redirection strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin. A workaround has been identified by using a custom redirection strategy via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies available in fluture-node@4.0.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node","events":[{"introduced":"23813ce8326bd9e5f1609defdd8ebac03d32da0f"},{"fixed":"d3ed6ff391d9a0613184fc933b006a665c87d31d"}]}],"versions":["v4.0.0","v4.0.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24719.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/24xxx/CVE-2022-24719.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node/commit/0c99bc511533d48be17dc6bfe641f7d0aeb34d77"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node/commit/125e4474f910c1507f8ec3232848626fbc0f55c4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node/security/advisories/GHSA-32x6-qvw6-mxj4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/4718"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24719"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-359"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/24xxx/CVE-2022-24719.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
