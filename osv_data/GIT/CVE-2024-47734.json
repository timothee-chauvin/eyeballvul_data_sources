To reproduce\nthis[1], one bond device (bond1) has xdpdrv, which increases\nbpf_master_redirect_enabled_key. Another bond device (bond0) which is\nunsupported by XDP but its slave (veth3) has xdpgeneric that returns\nXDP_TX. This triggers WARN_ON_ONCE() from the xdp_master_redirect().\nTo reduce unnecessary warnings and improve log management, we need to\ndelete the WARN_ON_ONCE() and add ratelimit to the
