{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-11301","published":"2025-03-20T10:15:24Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:35:12Z","details":"In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, the application allows the creation of evaluators without enforcing a unique constraint on the combination of projectId and slug. This allows an attacker to overwrite existing data by submitting a POST request with the same slug as an existing evaluator. The lack of database constraints or application-layer validation to prevent duplicates exposes the application to data integrity issues. This vulnerability can result in corrupted data and potentially malicious actions, impairing the system's functionality.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"79dc370596d979b756f6ea0250d97a2d02385ecd"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-11301.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/3d99aca5-b135-4833-b48b-7806bc4bf861"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/79dc370596d979b756f6ea0250d97a2d02385ecd"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
