Here, the non-member can trigger creation of a plain file whose group ownership is that group. The intended behavior was that the non-member can trigger creation of a directory (but not a plain file) whose group ownership is that group. The non-member can escalate privileges by making the plain file executable and SGID.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0fa3ecd87848c9c93c2c828ef4c3a8ca36ce46c7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-13405.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0fa3ecd87848c9c93c2c828ef4c3a8ca36ce46c7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-13405.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106503"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HRBNBX73SAFKQWBOX76SLMWPTKJPVGEJ/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MTKKIAUMR5FAYLZ7HLEPOXMKAAE3BYBQ/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=0fa3ecd87848c9c93c2c828ef4c3a8ca36ce46c7"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/07/13/2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2948"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3083"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3096"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0717"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2476"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2566"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2696"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2730"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:4159"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:4164"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git/commit/?id=0b3369840cd61c23e2b9241093737b4c395cb406"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0fa3ecd87848c9c93c2c828ef4c3a8ca36ce46c7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/08/msg00014.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K00854051"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://twitter.com/grsecurity/status/1015082951204327425"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3752-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3752-2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3752-3/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3753-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3753-2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3754-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4266"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45033/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
