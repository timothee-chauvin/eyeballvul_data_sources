Prior to version 1.8.0, the Faktory web dashboard can suffer from denial of service by a crafted malicious url query param `days`. The vulnerability is related to how the backend reads the `days` URL query parameter in the Faktory web dashboard. The value is used directly without any checks to create a string slice. If a very large value is provided, the backend server ends up using a significant amount of memory and causing it to crash. Version 1.8.0 fixes this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/contribsys/faktory","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"57707bc4b0d1fe703d2781f3fa45ff9dc21132e9"}]}],"versions":["v0.6.0-1","v0.6.1-1","v0.7.0-1","v0.8.0-1","v0.9.0-1","v0.9.1-1","v0.9.2-1","v0.9.3-1","v0.9.4-1","v0.9.5-1","v0.9.6-1","v0.9.7-1","v1.0.0-1","v1.0.1-1","v1.1.0-1","v1.1.0-2","v1.2.0-1","v1.3.0-1","v1.4.0-1","v1.4.1-1","v1.4.2-1","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-1","v1.5.1","v1.5.1-1","v1.5.2","v1.5.2-1","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.7.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-37279.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/contribsys/faktory/security/advisories/GHSA-x4hh-vjm7-g2jv"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-770","CWE-789"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
