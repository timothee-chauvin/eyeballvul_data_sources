Argo Workflows versions prior to 3.6.12 and versions 3.7.0 through 3.7.2 expose artifact repository credentials in plaintext in workflow-controller pod logs. An attacker with permissions to read pod logs in a namespace running Argo Workflows can read the workflow-controller logs and obtain credentials to the artifact repository. Update to versions 3.6.12 or 3.7.3 to remediate the vulnerability. No known workarounds exist.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows","events":[{"introduced":"d1d689b367c4c8a5a8a095ae60b5d7043f99eda9"},{"fixed":"bded09fe4abd37cb98d7fc81b4c14a6f5034e9ab"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.7.0"},{"fixed":"3.7.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"18ad5138b6bcb2aba04e00b4ec657bc6b8fad8df"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.12"}]}}],"versions":["ui-v3-rc1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha1","v2.0.0-alpha2","v2.0.0-alpha3","v2.0.0-beta1","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-alpha1","v2.1.0-beta1","v2.1.0-beta2","v2.1.1","v2.10.0-rc1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0-rc1","v2.3.0-rc2","v2.3.0-rc3","v3.1.0-rc1","v3.2.0-rc1","v3.2.0-rc2","v3.2.0-rc3","v3.2.0-rc4","v3.3.0-rc1","v3.3.0-rc2","v3.3.0-rc3","v3.3.0-rc4","v3.3.0-rc5","v3.3.0-rc6","v3.3.0-rc7","v3.3.0-rc8","v3.4.0-rc1","v3.4.0-rc2","v3.4.0-rc3","v3.4.0-rc4","v3.5.0","v3.5.0-rc1","v3.5.0-rc2","v3.6.0","v3.6.0-rc1","v3.6.0-rc2","v3.6.0-rc3","v3.6.0-rc4","v3.6.10","v3.6.11","v3.6.2","v3.6.3","v3.6.4","v3.6.5","v3.6.6","v3.6.7","v3.6.8","v3.6.9","v3.7.0","v3.7.0-rc4","v3.7.1","v3.7.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62157.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-c2hv-4pfj-mm2r"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/18ad5138b6bcb2aba04e00b4ec657bc6b8fad8df"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/bded09fe4abd37cb98d7fc81b4c14a6f5034e9ab"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-522"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
