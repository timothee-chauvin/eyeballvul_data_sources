The fstest\ngeneric/475 exercises various IO error paths, and is able to trigger\nerrors in cow_file_range where we fail to get to allocating the ordered\nextent. Note that because we *do* clear delalloc, we are likely to\nremove the inode from the delalloc list, so the inodes/pages to not have\ninvalidate/launder called on them in the commit abort path.\n\nThis results in failures at the unmount stage of the test that look like:\n\n  BTRFS: error (device dm-8 state EA) in cleanup_transaction:2018: errno=-5 IO failure\n  BTRFS: error (device dm-8 state EA) in btrfs_replace_file_extents:2416: errno=-5 IO failure\n  BTRFS warning (device dm-8 state EA): qgroup 0/5 has unreleased space, type 0 rsv 28672\n  ------------[ cut here ]------------\n  WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 22588 at fs/btrfs/disk-io.c:4333 close_ctree+0x222/0x4d0 [btrfs]\n  Modules linked in: btrfs blake2b_generic libcrc32c xor zstd_compress raid6_pq\n  CPU: 3 PID: 22588 Comm: umount Kdump: loaded Tainted: G W          6.10.0-rc7-gab56fde445b8 #21\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS Arch Linux 1.16.3-1-1 04/01/2014\n  RIP: 0010:close_ctree+0x222/0x4d0 [btrfs]\n  RSP: 0018:ffffb4465283be00 EFLAGS: 00010202\n  RAX: 0000000000000001 RBX: ffffa1a1818e1000 RCX: 0000000000000001\n  RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffb4465283bbe0 RDI: ffffa1a19374fcb8\n  RBP: ffffa1a1818e13c0 R08: 0000000100028b16 R09: 0000000000000000\n  R10: 0000000000000003 R11: 0000000000000003 R12: ffffa1a18ad7972c\n  R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: 0000000000000000\n  FS:  00007f9168312b80(0000) GS:ffffa1a4afcc0000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  CR2: 00007f91683c9140 CR3: 000000010acaa000 CR4: 00000000000006f0\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   ? close_ctree+0x222/0x4d0 [btrfs]\n   ? __warn.cold+0x8e/0xea\n   ? close_ctree+0x222/0x4d0 [btrfs]\n   ? report_bug+0xff/0x140\n   ? handle_bug+0x3b/0x70\n   ? exc_invalid_op+0x17/0x70\n   ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n   ? close_ctree+0x222/0x4d0 [btrfs]\n   generic_shutdown_super+0x70/0x160\n   kill_anon_super+0x11/0x40\n   btrfs_kill_super+0x11/0x20 [btrfs]\n   deactivate_locked_super+0x2e/0xa0\n   cleanup_mnt+0xb5/0x150\n   task_work_run+0x57/0x80\n   syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0x121/0x130\n   do_syscall_64+0xab/0x1a0\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\n  RIP: 0033:0x7f916847a887\n  ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n  BTRFS error (device dm-8 state EA): qgroup reserved space leaked\n\nCases 2 and 3 in the out_reserve path both pertain to this type of leak\nand must free the reserved qgroup data.
