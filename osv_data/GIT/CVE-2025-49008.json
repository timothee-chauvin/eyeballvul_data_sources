{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-49008","published":"2025-06-05T00:13:14Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:37:38.964434Z","aliases":["GHSA-rwc2-4q8c-xj48"],"summary":"Atheos Improper Input Validation Vulnerability Enables RCE in Common.php","details":"Atheos is a self-hosted browser-based cloud integrated development environment. Prior to version 6.0.4, improper use of `escapeshellcmd()` in `/components/codegit/traits/execute.php` allows argument injection, leading to arbitrary command execution. Atheos administrators and users of vulnerable versions are at risk of data breaches or server compromise. Version 6.0.4 introduces a `Common::safe_execute` function that sanitizes all arguments using `escapeshellarg()` prior to execution and migrated all components potentially vulnerable to similar exploits to use this new templated execution system.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/atheos/atheos","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7e6c0eb45fa6d04d786a0037389540f2638fe792"}]}],"versions":["v.1.0.0","v.1.0.1","v.1.1.0","v.1.1.1","v.1.1.3","v.1.1.4","v.1.1.5","v.1.1.6","v.1.2.0","v.1.2.1","v.1.3.0","v.1.3.1","v.1.3.10","v.1.3.11","v.1.3.12","v.1.3.13","v.1.3.2","v.1.3.3","v.1.3.5","v.1.3.8","v.1.4.0","v.1.4.1","v.1.4.2","v.1.4.3","v.1.5.0","v.1.5.1","v.1.6.0","v.1.7.0","v.1.7.5","v.1.7.8","v.1.7.9","v.1.8.0","v.1.8.1","v.1.8.2","v.1.8.3","v.1.8.4","v.1.9.0","v.1.9.1","v.1.9.2","v.2.0.0","v.2.0.2","v.2.0.4","v.2.0.6","v.2.0.7","v.2.1.0","v.2.1.3","v.2.1.4","v.2.1.6","v.2.1.7","v.2.1.8","v.2.1.9","v.2.2.1","v.2.2.2","v.2.2.3","v.2.2.4","v.2.2.5","v.2.2.6","v.2.2.7","v.2.2.8","v.2.2.9","v.2.3.0","v.2.3.1","v.2.3.2","v.2.3.3","v.2.3.4","v.2.3.5","v.2.3.6","v.2.3.7","v.2.3.8","v.2.3.9","v.2.4.0","v.2.4.1","v.2.4.2","v.2.4.3","v.2.5.0","v.2.5.1","v.2.5.2","v.2.5.3","v.2.5.4","v.2.6.0","v.2.6.1","v.2.6.2","v.2.6.3","v.2.6.4","v.2.6.5","v.2.6.6","v.2.7.0","v.2.7.1","v.2.7.2","v.2.7.4","v.2.7.5","v.2.8.0","v.2.8.1","v.2.8.3","v.2.8.4","v1.0.0","v1.3.6","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.2.0","v4.3.0","v5.0.0","v5.5.0","v601"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-49008.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Atheos/Atheos/commit/7e6c0eb45fa6d04d786a0037389540f2638fe792"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Atheos/Atheos/security/advisories/GHSA-rwc2-4q8c-xj48"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-78","CWE-88"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H"}]}
