{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-27608","published":"2025-04-02T21:09:16Z","modified":"2025-10-30T19:44:08.809583Z","aliases":["GHSA-252h-4j5q-88pc"],"summary":"Self Cross-Site Scripting in Arduino IDE","details":"Arduino IDE 2.x is an IDE based on the Theia IDE framework and built with Electron. A Self Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Arduino-IDE prior to version v2.3.5. The vulnerability occurs in the Additional Board Manager URLs field, which can be found in the Preferences -> Settings section of the Arduino IDE interface. In the vulnerable versions, any values entered in this field are directly displayed to the user through a notification tooltip object, without a proper output encoding routine, due to the underlying ElectronJS engine interpretation. This vulnerability exposes the input parameter to Self-XSS attacks, which may lead to security risks depending on where the malicious payload is injected. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.5.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8aa3c28c509341d912da74d8a7f34e10821254a3"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.1.2","0.1.3","2.0.0","2.0.0-beta.1","2.0.0-beta.10","2.0.0-beta.11","2.0.0-beta.12","2.0.0-beta.2","2.0.0-beta.3","2.0.0-beta.4","2.0.0-beta.5","2.0.0-beta.6","2.0.0-beta.7","2.0.0-beta.8","2.0.0-beta.9","2.0.0-rc1","2.0.0-rc2","2.0.0-rc3","2.0.0-rc4","2.0.0-rc5","2.0.0-rc6","2.0.0-rc7","2.0.0-rc8","2.0.0-rc9","2.0.0-rc9.1","2.0.0-rc9.2","2.0.0-rc9.3","2.0.0-rc9.4","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.1.0","2.3.0","2.3.3","2.3.4","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27608.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/security/advisories/GHSA-252h-4j5q-88pc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/commit/d298b3ffc94008e89066cd999d891e84190da18f"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
