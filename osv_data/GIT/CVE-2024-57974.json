After the server receives the first\ndatagram (cf. _xioopen_ipdgram_listen()), it issues a connect() to\nthe address of the sender, in order to set up a directed flow.\n\nNow, if the client, running on a different CPU thread, happens to\nsend a (subsequent) datagram while the server's socket changes its\naddress, but is not rehashed yet, this will result in a failed\nlookup and a port unreachable error delivered to the client, as\napparent from the following reproducer:\n\n  LEN=$(($(cat /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default) / 4))\n  dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=${LEN} of=tmp.in\n\n  while :; do\n  \ttaskset -c 1 socat UDP4-LISTEN:1337,null-eof OPEN:tmp.out,create,trunc &\n  \tsleep 0.1 || sleep 1\n  \ttaskset -c 2 socat OPEN:tmp.in UDP4:localhost:1337,shut-null\n  \twait\n  done\n\nwhere the client will eventually get ECONNREFUSED on a write()\n(typically the second or third one of a given iteration):\n\n  2024/11/13 21:28:23 socat[46901] E write(6, 0x556db2e3c000, 8192): Connection refused\n\nThis issue was first observed as a seldom failure in Podman's tests\nchecking UDP functionality while using pasta(1) to connect the\ncontainer's network namespace, which leads us to a reproducer with\nthe lookup error resulting in an ICMP packet on a tap device:\n\n  LOCAL_ADDR=\"$(ip -j -4 addr show|jq -rM '.[] | .addr_info[0] | select(.scope == \"global\").local')\"\n\n  while :; do\n  \t./pasta --config-net -p pasta.pcap -u 1337 socat UDP4-LISTEN:1337,null-eof OPEN:tmp.out,create,trunc &\n  \tsleep 0.2 || sleep 1\n  \tsocat OPEN:tmp.in UDP4:${LOCAL_ADDR}:1337,shut-null\n  \twait\n  \tcmp tmp.in tmp.out\n  done\n\nOnce this fails:\n\n  tmp.in tmp.out differ: char 8193, line 29\n\nwe can finally have a look at what's going on:\n\n  $ tshark -r pasta.pcap\n      1   0.000000           :: ? ff02::16     ICMPv6 110 Multicast Listener Report Message v2\n      2   0.168690 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192\n      3   0.168767 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192\n      4   0.168806 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192\n      5   0.168827 c6:47:05:8d:dc:04 ?
