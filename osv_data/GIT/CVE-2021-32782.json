{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-32782","published":"2021-09-07T20:15:07.603Z","modified":"2025-11-20T11:44:32.602835Z","related":["GHSA-hgpq-28gj-jrj9"],"details":"Nextcloud Circles is an open source social network built for the nextcloud ecosystem. In affected versions the Nextcloud Circles application is vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Circles application is upgraded to 0.21.3, 0.20.10 or 0.19.14 to resolve this issue. As a workaround users may use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy. A notable exemption is Internet Explorer which does not support CSP properly.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/circles","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"dbb97a83ccb342c839a54f088aa19b8ba6844b0e"}]}],"versions":["0.14.1","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.12.3","v0.12.4","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.13.3","v0.13.4","v0.13.5","v0.13.6","v0.14.0","v0.14.2","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.10","v0.17.2","v0.17.3","v0.17.4","v0.17.5","v0.17.6","v0.17.7","v0.17.8","v0.17.9","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.18.3","v0.19.0","v0.19.1","v0.19.2","v0.19.3","v0.19.4","v0.19.5","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.20.4","v0.20.5","v0.20.6","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.21.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.5","v0.9.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32782.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/circles/commit/dbb97a83ccb342c839a54f088aa19b8ba6844b0e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-hgpq-28gj-jrj9"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1217606"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
