Those mean that authenticated and authorized users at Eclipse Ditto can persist Things in Ditto which can - when being displayed by other users also being authorized to see those Things in the Eclipse Ditto UI - cause scripts to be executed in the browser of other users.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/eclipse-ditto/ditto","events":[{"introduced":"a022dcc2f4082a9a1df894af63e098113b484994"},{"fixed":"8fe1b3b9e0e2c333856dc166c8c3c7d2027c856d"}]}],"versions":["3.0.0","3.1.0","3.1.0-M1","3.2.0","3.3.0","3.3.2","3.3.2-M1","3.3.3","3.3.4","3.4.0","3.4.0-M1","3.4.0-M2","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.5.2","3.5.3","3.5.4","3.5.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-5165.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/cve-assignement/-/issues/23"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/201"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/202"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/204"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/207"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/209"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/210"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/211"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
