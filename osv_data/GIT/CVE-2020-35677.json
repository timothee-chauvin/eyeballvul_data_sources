The caveat here is that an attacker would need administrative privileges in order to create the payload. One might think this completely mitigates the privilege-escalation impact as there is only one high-privileged role. However, it was discovered that the endpoint responsible for creating the group lacks CSRF protection.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bigprof-software/online-invoicing-system","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"18522835aa2b23c5376bc1c68ef727f41f334f79"}]}],"versions":["2.3","2.4","2.5","2.6","2.7","2.9","3.0","3.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-35677.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://labs.ingredous.com/2020/07/13/ois-groupedit-xss/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
