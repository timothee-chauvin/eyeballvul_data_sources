{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68274","published":"2025-12-16T22:02:55.360Z","modified":"2025-12-18T05:56:52.536861Z","aliases":["GHSA-c623-f998-8hhv"],"summary":"SIPGO library has response DoS vulnerability via nil pointer dereference","details":"SIPGO is a library for writing SIP services in the GO language. Starting in version 0.3.0 and prior to version 1.0.0-alpha-1, a nil pointer dereference vulnerability is in the SIPGO library's `NewResponseFromRequest` function that affects all normal SIP operations. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to crash any SIP application by sending a single malformed SIP request without a To header. The vulnerability occurs when SIP message parsing succeeds for a request missing the To header, but the response creation code assumes the To header exists without proper nil checks. This affects routine operations like call setup, authentication, and message handling - not just error cases. This vulnerability affects all SIP applications using the sipgo library, not just specific configurations or edge cases, as long as they make use of the `NewResponseFromRequest` function. Version 1.0.0-alpha-1 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/emiago/sipgo","events":[{"introduced":"1a4726870bedc01e0f4dd83b8ed12430d6fd50b1"},{"fixed":"9bbb4febff533548072b3d0c4e46de8969ad4cd1"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.14.0","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.18.0","v0.19.0","v0.20.0","v0.21.0","v0.22.0","v0.22.1","v0.23.0","v0.24.0","v0.24.1","v0.25.0","v0.25.1","v0.26.0","v0.26.1","v0.27.0","v0.27.1","v0.28.0","v0.29.0","v0.3.0","v0.30.0","v0.31.0","v0.32.0","v0.32.1","v0.33.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v1.0.0-alpha"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68274.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68274.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/emiago/sipgo/commit/dc9669364a154ec6d134e542f6a63c31b5afe6e8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/emiago/sipgo/security/advisories/GHSA-c623-f998-8hhv"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68274"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-476","CWE-755"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68274.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
