It looks like we can just drop the fini() call since the\nfence signaller side will already call this for us.\n\nThere are known mysterious splats with device going to sleep even with\nan rpm ref, and this could be one candidate.\n\nv2 (Matt B):\n  - Prefer warning if we detect double fini()\n\n(cherry picked from commit cfcbc0520d5055825f0647ab922b655688605183)","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"f002702290fccbd473f5bb94e52f25c96917fff2"},{"fixed":"046bd018c0123b1a49c22abed5f9ea31d1454c78"},{"fixed":"03a86c24aea0920a1ca20a0d7771d5e176db538d"}]}],"versions":["v6.11","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.11.1","v6.11.2","v6.11.3","v6.11.4","v6.11.5","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-50144.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.11.0"},{"fixed":"6.11.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-50144.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/03a86c24aea0920a1ca20a0d7771d5e176db538d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/046bd018c0123b1a49c22abed5f9ea31d1454c78"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/50xxx/CVE-2024-50144.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50144"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/50xxx/CVE-2024-50144.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
