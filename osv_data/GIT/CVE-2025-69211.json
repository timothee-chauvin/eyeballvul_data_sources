{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-69211","published":"2025-12-29T16:01:22.801Z","modified":"2026-01-03T05:44:35.569025Z","aliases":["GHSA-8wpr-639p-ccrj"],"summary":"Nest has a Fastify URL Encoding Middleware Bypass (TOCTOU)","details":"Nest is a framework for building scalable Node.js server-side applications. Versions prior to 11.1.11 have a Fastify URL encoding middleware bypass. A NestJS application is vulnerable if it uses `@nestjs/platform-fastify`; relies on `NestMiddleware` (via `MiddlewareConsumer`) for security checks (authentication, authorization, etc.), or through `app.use()`; and applies middleware to specific routes using string paths or controllers (e.g., `.forRoutes('admin')`). Exploitation can result in unauthenticated users accessing protected routes, restricted administrative endpoints becoming accessible to lower-privileged users, and/or middleware performing sanitization or validation being skipped. This issue is patched in `@nestjs/platform-fastify@11.1.11`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nestjs/nest","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20529c07e3cc6647fa7611ef6eb776ad5507a325"}]}],"versions":["6.3.1","v10.0.0","v10.0.1","v10.0.2","v10.0.3","v10.0.4","v10.0.5","v10.1.0","v10.1.1","v10.1.2","v10.1.3","v10.2.0","v10.2.1","v10.2.10","v10.2.2","v10.2.3","v10.2.4","v10.2.5","v10.2.6","v10.2.7","v10.2.8","v10.2.9","v10.3.0","v10.3.1","v10.3.10","v10.3.2","v10.3.3","v10.3.4","v10.3.5","v10.3.6","v10.3.7","v10.3.8","v10.3.9","v10.4.0","v10.4.1","v10.4.10","v10.4.11","v10.4.12","v10.4.13","v10.4.14","v10.4.15","v10.4.2","v10.4.3","v10.4.4","v10.4.5","v10.4.6","v10.4.7","v10.4.8","v10.4.9","v11.0.0","v11.0.1","v11.0.10","v11.0.11","v11.0.12","v11.0.13","v11.0.14","v11.0.15","v11.0.16","v11.0.17","v11.0.18","v11.0.19","v11.0.2","v11.0.20","v11.0.21","v11.0.3","v11.0.4","v11.0.5","v11.0.6","v11.0.7","v11.0.8","v11.0.9","v11.1.0","v11.1.1","v11.1.10","v11.1.2","v11.1.3","v11.1.4","v11.1.5","v11.1.6","v11.1.7","v11.1.8","v11.1.9","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.4.2","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.5.10","v4.5.11","v4.5.12","v4.5.2","v4.5.3","v4.5.4","v4.5.5","v4.5.6","v4.5.8","v4.5.9","v4.6.1","v4.6.2","v4.6.3","v4.6.4","v4.6.5","v4.6.6","v5.0.0","v5.0.0-beta.0","v5.0.0-beta.1","v5.0.0-beta.2","v5.0.0-beta.3","v5.0.0-beta.4","v5.0.0-beta.6","v5.0.0-beta.7","v5.0.0-beta.8","v5.0.0-rc.1","v5.0.0-rc.2","v5.0.0-rc.3","v5.0.0-rc.4","v5.0.1","v5.1.0","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.2.2","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.10","v5.3.11","v5.3.12","v5.3.13","v5.3.14","v5.3.15","v5.3.2","v5.3.3","v5.3.4","v5.3.5","v5.3.6","v5.3.7","v5.3.7-postinstall-next","v5.3.8","v5.3.9","v5.4.0","v5.4.1","v5.5.0","v5.6.0","v5.6.1","v5.6.2","v5.7.0","v5.7.1","v5.7.2","v5.7.3","v5.7.4","v6.0.0","v6.0.0-rc.1","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.1.0","v6.1.1","v6.10.0","v6.10.1","v6.10.10","v6.10.11","v6.10.12","v6.10.13","v6.10.14","v6.10.2","v6.10.3","v6.10.4","v6.10.5","v6.10.6","v6.10.7","v6.10.8","v6.10.9","v6.11.0","v6.11.1","v6.11.10","v6.11.11","v6.11.2","v6.11.3","v6.11.4","v6.11.5","v6.11.6","v6.11.7","v6.11.8","v6.11.9","v6.2.0","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4","v6.3.0","v6.3.1","v6.3.2","v6.4.0","v6.4.1","v6.5.0","v6.5.1","v6.5.2","v6.5.3","v6.6.0","v6.6.1","v6.6.2","v6.6.3","v6.6.4","v6.6.5","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.7.0","v6.7.1","v6.7.2","v6.8.0","v6.8.1","v6.8.2","v6.8.3","v6.8.4","v6.8.5","v6.9.0","v7.0.0","v7.0.1","v7.0.10","v7.0.11","v7.0.12","v7.0.13","v7.0.2","v7.0.3","v7.0.4","v7.0.5","v7.0.6","v7.0.7","v7.0.8","v7.0.9","v7.1.0","v7.1.1","v7.1.2","v7.1.3","v7.2.0","v7.3.0","v7.3.1","v7.3.2","v7.4.0","v7.4.1","v7.4.2","v7.4.3","v7.4.4","v7.5.0","v7.5.1","v7.5.2","v7.5.3","v7.5.4","v7.5.5","v7.6.0","v7.6.1","v7.6.10","v7.6.11","v7.6.12","v7.6.13","v7.6.14","v7.6.15","v7.6.16","v7.6.17","v7.6.18","v7.6.2","v7.6.3","v7.6.4","v7.6.5","v7.6.6","v7.6.7","v7.6.8","v7.6.9","v8.0.0","v8.0.1","v8.0.10","v8.0.11","v8.0.2","v8.0.3","v8.0.4","v8.0.5","v8.0.6","v8.0.7","v8.0.8","v8.0.9","v8.1.0","v8.1.1","v8.1.2","v8.2.0","v8.2.1","v8.2.2","v8.2.3","v8.2.4","v8.2.5","v8.2.6","v8.3.0","v8.3.1","v8.4.0","v8.4.1","v8.4.2","v8.4.3","v8.4.4","v8.4.5","v8.4.6","v8.4.7","v9.0.0","v9.0.1","v9.0.10","v9.0.11","v9.0.2","v9.0.3","v9.0.4","v9.0.5","v9.0.6","v9.0.7","v9.0.8","v9.0.9","v9.1.0","v9.1.1","v9.1.2","v9.1.3","v9.1.4","v9.1.5","v9.1.6","v9.2.0","v9.2.1","v9.3.0","v9.3.0-beta.1","v9.3.0-beta.2","v9.3.0-beta.3","v9.3.1","v9.3.10","v9.3.11","v9.3.12","v9.3.2","v9.3.3","v9.3.4","v9.3.5","v9.3.6","v9.3.7","v9.3.8","v9.3.9","v9.4.0","v9.4.1","v9.4.2","v9.4.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-69211.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/69xxx/CVE-2025-69211.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nestjs/nest/commit/c4cedda15a05aafec1e6045b36b0335ab850e771"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nestjs/nest/security/advisories/GHSA-8wpr-639p-ccrj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69211"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-367"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/69xxx/CVE-2025-69211.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
