{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-64481","published":"2025-11-07T20:35:39.827Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:21:36.646712Z","aliases":["GHSA-w832-gg5g-x44m"],"summary":"Open redirect endpoint in Datasette","details":"Datasette is an open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data. In versions 0.65.1 and below and 1.0a0 through 1.0a19, deployed instances of Datasette include an open redirect vulnerability. Hits to the path //example.com/foo/bar/ (the trailing slash is required) will redirect the user to https://example.com/foo/bar. This problem has been patched in both Datasette 0.65.2 and 1.0a21. To workaround this issue, if Datasette is running behind a proxy, that proxy could be configured to replace // with / in incoming request URLs.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/simonw/datasette","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6a141467f9f8b05c84bc00c10e157962e3e43960"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.65.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/simonw/datasette","events":[{"introduced":"4a0bd960e9763623dae6a13c8af3810c4ce9fb0a"},{"fixed":"95a1fef28000d0b44ceaa398421530f588c5c385"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.0a0"},{"fixed":"1.0a20"}]}}],"versions":["0.10","0.11","0.12","0.13","0.14","0.15","0.16","0.17","0.18","0.19","0.20","0.21","0.22","0.22.1","0.23","0.23.1","0.23.2","0.24","0.25","0.25.1","0.25.2","0.26","0.26.1","0.26.2","0.27","0.28","0.29","0.29.1","0.29.2","0.29.3","0.30","0.30.1","0.30.2","0.31","0.31.1","0.31.2","0.32","0.33","0.34","0.35","0.36","0.37","0.37.1","0.38","0.39","0.40","0.41","0.42","0.43","0.44","0.45","0.45a0","0.45a1","0.45a2","0.45a3","0.45a4","0.45a5","0.46","0.47","0.47.1","0.47.2","0.47.3","0.48","0.49","0.49.1","0.49a0","0.49a1","0.50","0.50.1","0.50.2","0.50a0","0.50a1","0.51","0.51.1","0.51a0","0.51a1","0.51a2","0.52","0.52.1","0.52.2","0.52.3","0.52.4","0.53","0.54","0.54a0","0.55","0.56","0.57","0.57.1","0.57a0","0.57a1","0.58","0.58.1","0.58a0","0.58a1","0.59","0.59.1","0.59.2","0.59.3","0.59.4","0.59a0","0.59a1","0.59a2","0.60","0.60a0","0.60a1","0.61","0.61.1","0.61a0","0.62","0.62a0","0.62a1","0.63","0.63.1","0.63.2","0.63.3","0.63a0","0.63a1","0.64","0.64.1","0.64.2","0.64.3","0.64.4","0.64.5","0.64.6","0.64.7","0.64.8","0.65","0.65.1","0.7","0.8","0.9","1.0a0","1.0a1","1.0a10","1.0a11","1.0a12","1.0a13","1.0a14","1.0a15","1.0a16","1.0a17","1.0a18","1.0a19","1.0a2","1.0a3","1.0a4","1.0a5","1.0a6","1.0a8","1.0a9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64481.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64481.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/f257ca6edb64848c3b04b54d41e347c54fe57c05"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2429"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/simonw/datasette/security/advisories/GHSA-w832-gg5g-x44m"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64481"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-601"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64481.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N"}]}
