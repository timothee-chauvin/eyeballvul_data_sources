I've dug\ninto it a little, but I haven't been able to root-cause it yet.\nHowever, I bisected to commit 48aab1606fa8 (\"NFSD: Remove the cap on\nnumber of operations per NFSv4 COMPOUND\").\n\nTianshuo Han also reports a potential vulnerability when decoding\nan NFSv4 COMPOUND. An attacker can place an arbitrarily large op\ncount in the COMPOUND header, which results in:\n\n[   51.410584] nfsd: vmalloc error: size 1209533382144, exceeds total\npages, mode:0xdc0(GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_ZERO),\nnodemask=(null),cpuset=/,mems_allowed=0\n\nwhen NFSD attempts to allocate the COMPOUND op array.\n\nLet's restore the operation-per-COMPOUND limit, but increased to 200\nfor now.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"48aab1606fa80027143a445224f552b4eeea845b"},{"fixed":"b3ee7ce432289deac87b9d14e01f2fe6958f7f0b"},{"fixed":"3e7f011c255582d7c914133785bbba1990441713"}]}],"versions":["v6.16","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40210.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40210.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3e7f011c255582d7c914133785bbba1990441713"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b3ee7ce432289deac87b9d14e01f2fe6958f7f0b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40210.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40210"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40210.json"}}
