In Asterisk prior to versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, and 21.0.1, as well as certified-asterisk prior to 18.9-cert6, it is possible to read any arbitrary file even when the `live_dangerously` is not enabled. This allows arbitrary files to be read. Asterisk versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, and 21.0.1, as well as certified-asterisk prior to 18.9-cert6, contain a fix for this issue.",
