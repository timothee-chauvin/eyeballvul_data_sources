An authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Horilla 1.3.0 due to the unsafe use of Python’s eval() function on a user-controlled query parameter in the project_bulk_archive view. This allows privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute arbitrary system commands on the server. While having Django’s DEBUG=True makes exploitation visibly easier by returning command output in the HTTP response, this is not required. The vulnerability can still be exploited in DEBUG=False mode by using blind payloads such as a reverse shell, leading to full remote code execution. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b0aab62b3a5fe6b7114b5c58db129b3744b4d8cc"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48868.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla/security/advisories/GHSA-h6qj-pwmx-wjhw"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla/commit/b0aab62b3a5fe6b7114b5c58db129b3744b4d8cc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XQAJilt77QxkjGEa94CsZRqZIZXa3ET9/view?usp=sharing"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hnI9AK3fnpVrTlTRF7aRJsKhZCDIm2Ve/view?usp=sharing"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-95"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
