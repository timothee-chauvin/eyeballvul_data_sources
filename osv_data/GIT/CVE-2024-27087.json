The new link field introduced in Kirby 4 allows several different link types that each validate the entered link to the relevant URL format. It also includes a \"Custom\" link type for advanced use cases that don't fit any of the pre-defined link formats.  As the \"Custom\" link type is meant to be flexible, it also allows the javascript: URL scheme. In some use cases this can be intended, but it can also be misused by attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code when a user or visitor clicks on a link that is generated from the contents of the link field. This vulnerability is patched in 4.1.1.\n\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby","events":[{"introduced":"40eae8e8a4e1705412c64de63984376eeaa8b259"},{"fixed":"1353c9fbe3ede6bee946f527d146841719eef7d5"}]}],"versions":["4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.1.0","4.1.0-rc.1","4.1.0-rc.2","4.1.0-rc.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-27087.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/cda3dd9a15228d35e62ff86cfa87a67e7c687437"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-63h4-w25c-3qv4"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
