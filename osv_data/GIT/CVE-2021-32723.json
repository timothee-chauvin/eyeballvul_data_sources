Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24. As a workaround, do not use ASCIIDoc or ERB to highlight untrusted text. Other languages are not affected and can be used to highlight untrusted text.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/prismjs/prism","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3432b4b1e4440d6592ed82b6b5b9e72f660e43a8"}]}],"versions":["1.4.0","1.5.0","1.5.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.17.0","v1.17.1","v1.18.0","v1.19.0","v1.2.0","v1.20.0","v1.21.0","v1.22.0","v1.23.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.1","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32723.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2688"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2774"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
