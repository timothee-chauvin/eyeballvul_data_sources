An attacker who uses a vulnerability present in versions 3.7.0 through 3.16.4 can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop. This infinite loop blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. That is, for example, the case when the pypdf-user manipulates an incoming malicious PDF e.g. by merging it with another PDF or by adding annotations. The issue was fixed in version 3.17.0. As a workaround, apply the patch manually by modifying `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf","events":[{"introduced":"050bca679ca1b7988977a9df784e874ff33d1b9e"},{"fixed":"5a2dd757e14229899e3f48e9891e6d9a63c7963b"}]}],"versions":["3.10.0","3.11.0","3.11.1","3.12.0","3.12.1","3.12.2","3.13.0","3.14.0","3.15.0","3.15.1","3.15.2","3.15.3","3.15.4","3.15.5","3.16.0","3.16.1","3.16.2","3.16.3","3.16.4","3.7.0","3.7.1","3.8.0","3.8.1","3.9.0","3.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-46250.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/security/advisories/GHSA-wjcc-cq79-p63f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/commit/9b23ac3c9619492570011d551d521690de9a3e2d"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/2264"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-835"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
