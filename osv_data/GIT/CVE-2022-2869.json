An attacker who supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop could trigger this flaw, most likely by tricking a user into opening the crafted file with tiffcrop. Triggering this flaw could cause a crash or potentially further exploitation.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b6a17e567f143fab49734a9e09e5bafeb6f97354"}]}],"versions":["v3.5.3","v3.5.4","v3.5.5","v3.5.7","v3.6.0","v3.6.0beta2","v3.6.1","v3.7.0","v3.7.0alpha","v3.7.0beta","v3.7.0beta2","v3.7.1","v3.7.2","v3.7.3","v3.7.4","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.8.2","v4.0.0","v4.0.0alpha","v4.0.0alpha4","v4.0.0alpha5","v4.0.0alpha6","v4.0.0beta7","v4.0.1","v4.0.10","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.4beta","v4.0.5","v4.0.6","v4.0.7","v4.0.8","v4.0.9","v4.1.0","v4.2.0","v4.3.0","v4.3.0rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-2869.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2118869"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00018.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5333"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
