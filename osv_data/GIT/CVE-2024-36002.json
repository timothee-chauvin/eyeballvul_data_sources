In this scenario pin was registered twice,\nso resources are not yet expected to be release until each registered\npin/pin pair is unregistered.\n\nCurrently, the following crash/call trace is produced when ice driver is\nremoved on the system with installed E810T NIC which includes dpll device:\n\nWARNING: CPU: 51 PID: 9155 at drivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:809 dpll_pin_ops+0x20/0x30\nRIP: 0010:dpll_pin_ops+0x20/0x30\nCall Trace:\n ? __warn+0x7f/0x130\n ? dpll_pin_ops+0x20/0x30\n dpll_msg_add_pin_freq+0x37/0x1d0\n dpll_cmd_pin_get_one+0x1c0/0x400\n ? __nlmsg_put+0x63/0x80\n dpll_pin_event_send+0x93/0x140\n dpll_pin_on_pin_unregister+0x3f/0x100\n ice_dpll_deinit_pins+0xa1/0x230 [ice]\n ice_remove+0xf1/0x210 [ice]\n\nFix by adding a parent pointer as a cookie when creating a registration,\nalso when searching for it.
