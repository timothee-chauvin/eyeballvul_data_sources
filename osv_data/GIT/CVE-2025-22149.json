Prior to 0.6.0, the project's provided HTTP client's local JWK Set cache should do a full replacement when the goroutine refreshes the remote JWK Set. The current behavior is to overwrite or append. This is a security issue for use cases that utilize the provided auto-caching HTTP client and where key removal from a JWK Set is equivalent to revocation. The affected auto-caching HTTP client was added in version v0.5.0 and fixed in v0.6.0. The only workaround would be to remove the provided auto-caching HTTP client and replace it with a custom implementation. This involves setting the HTTPClientStorageOptions.RefreshInterval to zero (or not specifying the value).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/micahparks/jwkset","events":[{"introduced":"cb01b09f5aff1091e1194535259f16ff33f3135f"},{"fixed":"01db49a90f7f20c7fb39a699a2f19a7a5f379ed3"}]}],"versions":["v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.10","v0.5.11","v0.5.12","v0.5.13","v0.5.14","v0.5.15","v0.5.16","v0.5.17","v0.5.18","v0.5.19","v0.5.2","v0.5.20","v0.5.21","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.5.7","v0.5.8","v0.5.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-22149.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/MicahParks/jwkset/commit/01db49a90f7f20c7fb39a699a2f19a7a5f379ed3"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/MicahParks/jwkset/issues/40"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/MicahParks/jwkset/security/advisories/GHSA-675f-rq2r-jw82"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2025-22149-detect-jwkset-vulnerability-in-go-projects-1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2025-22149-mitigate-jwkset-vulnerability-in-go-projects"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-672"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
