{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-32317","published":"2023-05-26T22:42:09Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:13:06.117550Z","aliases":["GHSA-h8g5-vhm4-wx6g"],"summary":"Autolab tar slip in cheat checker functionality (`GHSL-2023-082`)","details":"Autolab is a course management service that enables auto-graded programming assignments. A Tar slip vulnerability was found in the MOSS cheat checker functionality of Autolab. To exploit this vulnerability an authenticated attacker with instructor permissions needs to upload a specially crafted Tar file. Both \"Base File Tar\" and \"Additional file archive\" can be fed with Tar files that contain paths outside their target directories (e.g.,  `../../../../tmp/tarslipped2.sh`). When the MOSS cheat checker is started the files inside of the archives are expanded to the attacker-chosen locations. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write within the scope of the running process.  This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/autolab/autolab","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"03d3a54e62f49cef64e5eed7aa34bfeec18db0bd"}]}],"versions":["2.0.4","2.0.8","2.1.0","2.2.0","2.2.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.10.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-32317.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/commit/410a9228ee265f80692334d75eb2c3b4dac6f9e5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/security/advisories/GHSA-h8g5-vhm4-wx6g"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-081_GHSL-2023-082_Autolab/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H"}]}
