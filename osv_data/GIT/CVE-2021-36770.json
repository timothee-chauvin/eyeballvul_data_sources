Exploitation requires an unusual configuration, and certain 2021 versions of Encode.pm (3.05 through 3.11). This issue occurs because the || operator evaluates @INC in a scalar context, and thus @INC has only an integer value.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dankogai/p5-encode","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"527e482dc70b035d0df4f8c77a00d81f8d775c74"}]}],"versions":["2.100","2.27","2.28","2.29","2.30","2.31","2.32","2.33","2.34","2.35","2.37","2.39","2.40","2.41","2.42","2.43","2.44","2.45","2.46","2.47","2.48","2.49","2.50","2.51","2.52","2.53","2.54","2.55","2.56","2.57","2.58","2.59","2.60","2.61","2.62","2.63","2.64","2.65","2.66","2.67","2.68","2.69","2.70","2.71","2.72","2.73","2.74","2.75","2.76","2.77","2.78","2.79","2.80","2.82","2.84","2.85","2.86","2.87","2.88","2.89","2.90","2.91","2.92","2.93","2.94","2.95","2.96","2.97","2.98","2.99","3.00","3.01","3.02","3.03","3.04","3.05","3.06","3.07","3.08","3.09","3.10","3.11"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-36770.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/perl/perl5","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c1a937fef07c061600a0078f4cb53fe9c2136bb9"}]}],"versions":["GitLive-blead","if-0.0602","if-0.0603","if-0.0604","if-0.0605","perl-1.0","perl-2.0","perl-3.000","perl-3.044","perl-4.0.00","perl-4.0.36","perl-5.000","perl-5.000o","perl-5.001","perl-5.001n","perl-5.002","perl-5.002_01","perl-5.003","perl-5.003_01","perl-5.003_02","perl-5.003_03","perl-5.003_04","perl-5.003_05","perl-5.003_07","perl-5.003_08","perl-5.003_09","perl-5.003_10","perl-5.003_11","perl-5.003_12","perl-5.003_13","perl-5.003_14","perl-5.003_15","perl-5.003_16","perl-5.003_17","perl-5.003_18","perl-5.003_19","perl-5.003_20","perl-5.003_21","perl-5.003_22","perl-5.003_23","perl-5.003_24","perl-5.003_25","perl-5.003_26","perl-5.003_27","perl-5.003_28","perl-5.003_90","perl-5.003_91","perl-5.003_92","perl-5.003_93","perl-5.003_94","perl-5.003_95","perl-5.003_96","perl-5.003_97","perl-5.003_97a","perl-5.003_97b","perl-5.003_97c","perl-5.003_97d","perl-5.003_97e","perl-5.003_97f","perl-5.003_97g","perl-5.003_97h","perl-5.003_97i","perl-5.003_97j","perl-5.003_98","perl-5.003_99","perl-5.003_99a","perl-5.004","perl-5.004_01","perl-5.004_02","perl-5.004_03","perl-5.004_04","perl-5.005","perl-5.005_01","perl-5.005_02","perl-5.6.0","perl-5.7.0","perl-5.7.1","perl-5.7.2","perl-5.7.3","perl-5.8.0","perl-5.9.0","perl-5.9.1","perl-5.9.2","perl-5.9.3","perl-5.9.4","perl-5.9.5","perl-5a2","perl-5a9","v5.10.0","v5.11.0","v5.11.1","v5.11.2","v5.11.3","v5.11.4","v5.11.5","v5.12.0","v5.12.0-RC0","v5.12.0-RC1","v5.12.0-RC2","v5.12.0-RC3","v5.12.0-RC4","v5.12.0-RC5","v5.13.0","v5.13.1","v5.13.10","v5.13.11","v5.13.2","v5.13.3","v5.13.4","v5.13.5","v5.13.6","v5.13.7","v5.13.8","v5.13.9","v5.14.0","v5.14.0-RC1","v5.14.0-RC2","v5.14.0-RC3","v5.15.0","v5.15.1","v5.15.2","v5.15.3","v5.15.4","v5.15.5","v5.15.6","v5.15.7","v5.15.8","v5.15.9","v5.16.0","v5.16.0-RC1","v5.16.0-RC2","v5.17.0","v5.17.1","v5.17.10","v5.17.11","v5.17.2","v5.17.3","v5.17.4","v5.17.5","v5.17.6","v5.17.7","v5.17.7.0","v5.17.8","v5.17.9","v5.18.0","v5.18.0-RC1","v5.18.0-RC2","v5.18.0-RC3","v5.18.0-RC4","v5.19.0","v5.19.1","v5.19.10","v5.19.11","v5.19.2","v5.19.3","v5.19.4","v5.19.5","v5.19.6","v5.19.7","v5.19.8","v5.19.9","v5.20.0","v5.20.0-RC1","v5.21.0","v5.21.1","v5.21.10","v5.21.11","v5.21.2","v5.21.3","v5.21.4","v5.21.5","v5.21.6","v5.21.7","v5.21.8","v5.21.9","v5.22.0","v5.22.0-RC1","v5.22.0-RC2","v5.23.0","v5.23.1","v5.23.2","v5.23.3","v5.23.4","v5.23.5","v5.23.6","v5.23.7","v5.23.8","v5.23.9","v5.24.0","v5.24.0-RC1","v5.24.0-RC2","v5.24.0-RC3","v5.24.0-RC4","v5.24.0-RC5","v5.25.0","v5.25.1","v5.25.10","v5.25.11","v5.25.12","v5.25.2","v5.25.3","v5.25.4","v5.25.5","v5.25.6","v5.25.7","v5.25.8","v5.25.9","v5.26.0","v5.26.0-RC1","v5.26.0-RC2","v5.27.0","v5.27.1","v5.27.10","v5.27.11","v5.27.2","v5.27.3","v5.27.4","v5.27.5","v5.27.6","v5.27.7","v5.27.8","v5.27.9","v5.28.0","v5.28.0-RC1","v5.28.0-RC2","v5.28.0-RC3","v5.28.0-RC4","v5.29.0","v5.29.1","v5.29.10","v5.29.2","v5.29.3","v5.29.4","v5.29.5","v5.29.6","v5.29.7","v5.29.8","v5.29.9","v5.30.0","v5.30.0-RC1","v5.30.0-RC2","v5.31.0","v5.31.1","v5.31.10","v5.31.11","v5.31.2","v5.31.3","v5.31.4","v5.31.5","v5.31.6","v5.31.7","v5.31.8","v5.31.9","v5.32.0","v5.32.0-RC0","v5.32.0-RC1","v5.33.0","v5.33.1","v5.33.2","v5.33.3","v5.33.4","v5.33.5","v5.33.6","v5.33.7","v5.33.8","v5.33.9","v5.34.0","v5.34.0-RC1","v5.34.0-RC2","v5.35.0","v5.35.1","v5.35.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-36770.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5NDGQSGMEZ75FJGBKNYC75OTO7TF7XHB/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6KOZYD7BH2DNIAEZ2ZL4PJ4QUVQI6Y33/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Perl/perl5/commit/c1a937fef07c061600a0078f4cb53fe9c2136bb9"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/dankogai/p5-encode/commit/527e482dc70b035d0df4f8c77a00d81f8d775c74
