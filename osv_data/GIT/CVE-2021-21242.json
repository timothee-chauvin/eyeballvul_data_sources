  "details": "OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, there is a critical vulnerability which can lead to pre-auth remote code execution. AttachmentUploadServlet deserializes untrusted data from the `Attachment-Support` header. This Servlet does not enforce any authentication or authorization checks. This issue may lead to pre-auth remote code execution. This issue was fixed in 4.0.3 by removing AttachmentUploadServlet and not using deserialization",
