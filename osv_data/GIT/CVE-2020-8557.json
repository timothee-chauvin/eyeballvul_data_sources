The /etc/hosts file mounted in a pod by kubelet is not included by the kubelet eviction manager when calculating ephemeral storage usage by a pod. If a pod writes a large amount of data to the /etc/hosts file, it could fill the storage space of the node and cause the node to fail.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubelet","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3c88459e7af1fdf57330d5fecc6b86463c7a9a6c"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-8557.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"39a145ca3413079bcb9c80846488786fed5fe1cb"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.13.1-dev","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.19.0","v0.19.1","v0.19.2","v0.19.3","v0.2","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.21.2","v0.3","v0.4","v0.5","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0-alpha.0","v1.1.0-alpha.1","v1.10.0-alpha.0","v1.10.0-alpha.1","v1.10.0-alpha.2","v1.10.0-alpha.3","v1.11.0-alpha.0","v1.11.0-alpha.1","v1.11.0-alpha.2","v1.12.0-alpha.0","v1.12.0-alpha.1","v1.13.0-alpha.0","v1.13.0-alpha.1","v1.13.0-alpha.2","v1.13.0-alpha.3","v1.14.0-alpha.0","v1.14.0-alpha.1","v1.14.0-alpha.2","v1.14.0-alpha.3","v1.15.0-alpha.0","v1.15.0-alpha.1","v1.15.0-alpha.2","v1.15.0-alpha.3","v1.16.0","v1.16.0-alpha.0","v1.16.0-alpha.1","v1.16.0-alpha.2","v1.16.0-alpha.3","v1.16.0-beta.0","v1.16.0-beta.1","v1.16.0-beta.2","v1.16.0-rc.1","v1.16.0-rc.2","v1.16.1","v1.16.1-beta.0","v1.16.10","v1.16.10-beta.0","v1.16.11","v1.16.11-rc.0","v1.16.12","v1.16.12-rc.0","v1.16.12-rc.1","v1.16.13-rc.0","v1.16.2","v1.16.2-beta.0","v1.16.3","v1.16.3-beta.0","v1.16.4","v1.16.4-beta.0","v1.16.5","v1.16.5-beta.0","v1.16.5-beta.1","v1.16.6","v1.16.6-beta.0","v1.16.7","v1.16.7-beta.0","v1.16.8","v1.16.8-beta.0","v1.16.9","v1.16.9-beta.0","v1.17.0-alpha.0","v1.2.0-alpha.1","v1.2.0-alpha.2","v1.2.0-alpha.3","v1.2.0-alpha.4","v1.2.0-alpha.5","v1.2.0-alpha.6","v1.2.0-alpha.7","v1.2.0-alpha.8","v1.3.0-alpha.0","v1.3.0-alpha.1","v1.3.0-alpha.2","v1.3.0-alpha.3","v1.3.0-alpha.4","v1.3.0-alpha.5","v1.4.0-alpha.0","v1.4.0-alpha.1","v1.4.0-alpha.2","v1.4.0-alpha.3","v1.5.0-alpha.0","v1.5.0-alpha.1","v1.5.0-alpha.2","v1.6.0-alpha.0","v1.6.0-alpha.1","v1.6.0-alpha.2","v1.6.0-alpha.3","v1.7.0-alpha.0","v1.7.0-alpha.1","v1.7.0-alpha.2","v1.7.0-alpha.3","v1.7.0-alpha.4","v1.8.0-alpha.0","v1.8.0-alpha.1","v1.8.0-alpha.2","v1.8.0-alpha.3","v1.9.0-alpha.0","v1.9.0-alpha.1","v1.9.0-alpha.2","v1.9.0-alpha.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-8557.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/93032"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/cB_JUsYEKyY/m/vVSO61AhBwAJ"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200821-0002/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
