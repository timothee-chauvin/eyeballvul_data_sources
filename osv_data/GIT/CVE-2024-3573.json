The issue arises from the 'is_local_uri' function's failure to properly handle URIs with empty or 'file' schemes, leading to the misclassification of URIs as non-local. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious model versions with specially crafted 'source' parameters, enabling the reading of sensitive files within at least two directory levels from the server's root.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"438a450714a3ca06285eeea34bdc6cf79d7f6cbc"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v1.7.0","v2.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-3573.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/8ea058a7-4ef8-4baf-9198-bc0147fc543c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/commit/438a450714a3ca06285eeea34bdc6cf79d7f6cbc"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
