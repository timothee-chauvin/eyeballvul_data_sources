Starting with version 3.0.0 and prior to version 3.7.0, by trusting that the server will return a certificate that belongs to the keypair of the user, a malicious server could get the desktop client to encrypt files with a key known to the attacker. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop 3.7.0. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop","events":[{"introduced":"ff175088a391007b66bfca89ef35cf29e37cf001"},{"fixed":"292d6973a33c08950bc3955d9d2b20ffafc58957"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-29000.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/29xxx/CVE-2023-29000.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/4949"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-h82x-98q3-7534"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1679267"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29000"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-295"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/29xxx/CVE-2023-29000.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
