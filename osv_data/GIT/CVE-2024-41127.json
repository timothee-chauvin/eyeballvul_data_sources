{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-41127","published":"2024-08-02T14:46:21Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:28:27.651417Z","aliases":["GHSA-wcjf-5464-4wq9"],"summary":"Monkeytype is vulnerable to Poisoned Pipeline Execution through Code Injection in its `ci-failure-comment.yml` GitHub Workflow, enabling attackers to gain `pull-requests` write access.","details":"Monkeytype is a minimalistic and customizable typing test. Monkeytype is vulnerable to Poisoned Pipeline Execution through Code Injection in its ci-failure-comment.yml GitHub Workflow, enabling attackers to gain pull-requests write access. The ci-failure-comment.yml workflow is triggered when the Monkey CI workflow completes. When it runs, it will download an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow and assign the contents of ./pr_num/pr_num.txt artifact to the steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content WorkFlow variable. It is not validated that the variable is actually a number and later it is interpolated into a JS script allowing an attacker to change the code to be executed. This issue leads to pull-requests write access. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.30.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7e399b6b9f8b9c18d5f232cdc66d1416847fea56"}]}],"versions":["v1.0","v1.0.1","v1.1","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.1.8","v1.1.9","v1.10","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.11","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.12","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.12.3","v1.13","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.13.3","v1.13.4","v1.14","v1.14.1","v1.14.3","v1.14.4","v1.15","v1.15.1","v1.15.2","v1.15.3","v1.16","v1.16.1","v1.16.2","v1.17","v1.17.1","v1.17.10","v1.17.11","v1.17.12","v1.17.13","v1.17.14","v1.17.2","v1.17.3","v1.17.4","v1.17.5","v1.17.6","v1.17.7","v1.17.8","v1.17.9","v1.2","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.3","v1.3.1","v1.3.10","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v1.4","v1.4.1","v1.4.10","v1.4.11","v1.4.12","v1.4.13","v1.4.14","v1.4.15","v1.4.16","v1.4.17","v1.4.18","v1.4.19","v1.4.2","v1.4.20","v1.4.21","v1.4.22","v1.4.23","v1.4.24","v1.4.25","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.4.7","v1.4.8","v1.4.9","v1.5","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.5.6","v1.5.7","v1.5.8","v1.6","v1.6.1","v1.6.10","v1.6.11","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.6.9","v1.7","v1.7.1","v1.7.10","v1.7.11","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.7.5","v1.7.6","v1.7.7","v1.7.8","v1.7.9","v1.8","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.8.5","v1.9","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v23.40.1","v23.41.0","v23.42.0","v23.43.0","v23.43.1","v23.45.0","v23.46.0","v23.46.1","v23.47.0","v23.48.0","v23.51.0","v24.11.0","v24.11.1","v24.11.2","v24.11.3","v24.12.0","v24.12.1","v24.14.0","v24.14.1","v24.15.0","v24.15.1","v24.17.0","v24.17.1","v24.17.2","v24.17.3","v24.17.4","v24.17.5","v24.18.0","v24.18.1","v24.19.0","v24.2.0","v24.20.0","v24.20.1","v24.21.0","v24.21.1","v24.22.0","v24.24.0","v24.25.0","v24.27.0","v24.28.0","v24.29.0","v24.3.0","v24.4.0","v24.4.1","v24.5.0","v24.5.1","v24.5.2","v24.6.0","v24.6.1","v24.6.2","v24.7.0","v24.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-41127.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/commit/29627fd0d5f152e2da59671987090ea0a5c29874"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/security/advisories/GHSA-wcjf-5464-4wq9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-167_monkeytype"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-74"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
