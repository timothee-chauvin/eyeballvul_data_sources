The most key_put() is normally allowed to do is\nto touch key_gc_work as that's a static global variable.\n\nHowever, in an effort to speed up the reclamation of quota, this is now\ndone in key_put() once the key's usage is reduced to 0 - but now the code\nis looking at the key after the deadline, which is forbidden.\n\nFix this by using a flag to indicate that a key can be gc'd now rather than\nlooking at the key's refcount in the garbage collector.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9578e327b2b4935a25d49e3891b8fcca9b6c10c6"},{"fixed":"6afe2ea2daec156bd94ad2c5a6f4f4c48240dcd3"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9578e327b2b4935a25d49e3891b8fcca9b6c10c6"},{"fixed":"f6a3cf833188e897c97028cd7b926e3f2cb1a8c0"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9578e327b2b4935a25d49e3891b8fcca9b6c10c6"},{"fixed":"75845c6c1a64483e9985302793dbf0dfa5f71e32"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.13.1","v6.13.2","v6.13.3","v6.13.4","v6.13.5","v6.13.6","v6.13.7","v6.13.8","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21893.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.10.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.21"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.13.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21893.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6afe2ea2daec156bd94ad2c5a6f4f4c48240dcd3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/75845c6c1a64483e9985302793dbf0dfa5f71e32"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f6a3cf833188e897c97028cd7b926e3f2cb1a8c0"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
