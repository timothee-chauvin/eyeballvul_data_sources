The length of this\nstring without the %s is 16 characters. The warning message indicated\nthat 'chip_name' could be up to 29 characters long, resulting in a total\nof 45 characters, which exceeds the buffer size of 30 characters.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the size of the 'ucode_prefix' buffer has been\nreduced from 30 to 15. This ensures that the maximum possible length of\nthe string being written into the buffer will not exceed its size, thus\npreventing potential buffer overflow and truncation issues.\n\nFixes the below with gcc W=1:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfx_v9_4_3.c: In function ‘gfx_v9_4_3_early_init’:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfx_v9_4_3.c:379:52: warning: ‘%s’ directive output may be truncated writing up to 29 bytes into a region of size 23 [-Wformat-truncation=]\n  379 |         snprintf(fw_name, sizeof(fw_name), \"amdgpu/%s_rlc.bin\", chip_name);\n      |                                                    ^~\n......\n  439 |         r = gfx_v9_4_3_init_rlc_microcode(adev, ucode_prefix);\n      |                                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfx_v9_4_3.c:379:9: note: ‘snprintf’ output between 16 and 45 bytes into a destination of size 30\n  379 |         snprintf(fw_name, sizeof(fw_name), \"amdgpu/%s_rlc.bin\", chip_name);\n      |         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfx_v9_4_3.c:413:52: warning: ‘%s’ directive output may be truncated writing up to 29 bytes into a region of size 23 [-Wformat-truncation=]\n  413 |         snprintf(fw_name, sizeof(fw_name), \"amdgpu/%s_mec.bin\", chip_name);\n      |                                                    ^~\n......\n  443 |         r = gfx_v9_4_3_init_cp_compute_microcode(adev, ucode_prefix);\n      |                                                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfx_v9_4_3.c:413:9: note: ‘snprintf’ output between 16 and 45 bytes into a destination of size 30\n  413 |         snprintf(fw_name, sizeof(fw_name), \"amdgpu/%s_mec.bin\", chip_name);\n      |         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"86301129698be52f8398f92ea8564168f6bfcae1"},{"fixed":"19bd9537b6bc1c882df25206c15917214d8e9460"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"86301129698be52f8398f92ea8564168f6bfcae1"},{"fixed":"f1b6a016dfa45cedc080d36fa5d6f22237d80e8b"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"86301129698be52f8398f92ea8564168f6bfcae1"},{"fixed":"acce6479e30f73ab0872e93a75aed1fb791d04ec"}]}],"versions":["v6.3","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.4","v6.6.5","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7","v6.9.1","v6.9.2","v6.9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-39291.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.5.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.33"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.9.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-39291.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/19bd9537b6bc1c882df25206c15917214d8e9460"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/acce6479e30f73ab0872e93a75aed1fb791d04ec"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f1b6a016dfa45cedc080d36fa5d6f22237d80e8b"}]}
