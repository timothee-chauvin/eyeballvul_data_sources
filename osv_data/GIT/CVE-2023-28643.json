In affected versions when a recipient receives 2 shares with the same name, while a memory cache is configured, the second share will replace the first one instead of being renamed to `{name} (2)`. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 25.0.3 or 24.0.9. Users unable to upgrade should avoid sharing 2 folders with the same name to the same user.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b4899ddee19c94db5d65c1f813fad51541ae1347"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"24.0.9"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server","events":[{"introduced":"20ea9a25353129b56d46951fe7d23939665ab2b2"},{"fixed":"494a0c1073b460d4d2a5c03ff3567fc388b91e36"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"25.0.0"},{"fixed":"25.0.3"}]}}],"versions":["list","v1.0.0beta1","v1.0RC1","v1.1","v11.0.0","v11.0RC2","v12.0.0beta1","v12.0.0beta2","v12.0.0beta3","v12.0.0beta4","v13.0.0RC1","v13.0.0beta1","v13.0.0beta2","v13.0.0beta3","v13.0.0beta4","v14.0.0RC1","v14.0.0RC2","v14.0.0beta1","v14.0.0beta2","v14.0.0beta3","v14.0.0beta4","v15.0.0RC1","v15.0.0beta1","v15.0.0beta2","v16.0.0RC1","v16.0.0alpha1","v16.0.0beta1","v16.0.0beta2","v16.0.0beta3","v17.0.0beta1","v17.0.0beta2","v17.0.0beta3","v17.0.0beta4","v18.0.0RC1","v18.0.0beta1","v18.0.0beta2","v18.0.0beta3","v18.0.0beta4","v19.0.0RC1","v19.0.0RC2","v19.0.0beta1","v19.0.0beta2","v19.0.0beta3","v19.0.0beta4","v19.0.0beta5","v19.0.0beta6","v19.0.0beta7","v2.0beta3","v20.0.0RC1","v20.0.0beta1","v20.0.0beta2","v20.0.0beta3","v20.0.0beta4","v21.0.0beta1","v21.0.0beta2","v21.0.0beta3","v21.0.0beta4","v21.0.0beta5","v21.0.0beta6","v21.0.0beta7","v21.0.0beta8","v22.0.0beta1","v22.0.0beta2","v22.0.0beta3","v22.0.0beta4","v22.0.0beta5","v22.0.0rc1","v23.0.0beta1","v23.0.0beta2","v23.0.0beta3","v24.0.0","v24.0.0beta1","v24.0.0beta2","v24.0.0beta3","v24.0.0rc1","v24.0.0rc2","v24.0.0rc3","v24.0.1","v24.0.1rc1","v24.0.2","v24.0.2rc1","v24.0.3","v24.0.3rc1","v24.0.3rc2","v24.0.4","v24.0.4rc1","v24.0.5","v24.0.5rc1","v24.0.6","v24.0.6rc1","v24.0.7","v24.0.7rc1","v24.0.8","v24.0.8rc1","v24.0.8rc2","v24.0.9rc1","v24.0.9rc2","v25.0.0","v25.0.1","v25.0.1rc1","v25.0.2","v25.0.2rc1","v25.0.2rc2","v25.0.2rc3","v25.0.3rc1","v25.0.3rc2","v3.0","v3.0RC1","v3.0alpha1","v4.0.0","v4.0.0RC","v4.0.0RC2","v4.0.0beta","v4.0.1","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.5","v4.0.6","v4.5.0","v4.5.0RC1","v4.5.0RC2","v4.5.0RC3","v4.5.0beta1","v4.5.0beta2","v4.5.0beta3","v4.5.0beta4","v5.0.0","v5.0.0RC1","v5.0.0RC2","v5.0.0RC3","v5.0.0alpha1","v5.0.0beta1","v5.0.0beta2","v6.0.0RC1","v6.0.0RC2","v6.0.0alpha2","v6.0.0beta2","v6.0.0beta3","v6.0.0beta4","v6.0.0beta5","v7.0.0alpha2","v7.0.0beta1","v8.0.0","v8.0.0RC1","v8.0.0RC2","v8.0.0alpha1","v8.0.0alpha2","v8.0.0beta1","v8.0.0beta2","v8.1.0alpha1","v8.1.0alpha2","v8.1.0beta1","v8.1.0beta2","v8.1RC2","v8.2RC1","v8.2beta1","v9.0.0beta2","v9.0.1beta2","v9.0beta1","v9.1.0beta1","v9.1.0beta2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-28643.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/28xxx/CVE-2023-28643.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-hhq4-4pr8-wm27"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/34015"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/36047"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28643"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-706"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/28xxx/CVE-2023-28643.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
