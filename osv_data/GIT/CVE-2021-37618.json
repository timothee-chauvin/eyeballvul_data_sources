An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to print the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when printing the image ICC profile, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command line option (`-p C`). The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/exiv2/exiv2","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"15098f4ef50cc721ad0018218acab2ff06e60beb"}]}],"versions":["0.27","0.27-RC2","0.27-RC3","0.27.1","v0.10","v0.11","v0.12","v0.13","v0.14","v0.15","v0.16","v0.16-pre1","v0.17","v0.17.1","v0.18","v0.18-pre1","v0.18-pre2","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.19","v0.20","v0.21","v0.21.1","v0.22","v0.23","v0.23.1","v0.24","v0.25","v0.26","v0.27-RC1","v0.27.0","v0.27.1","v0.27.1-RC1","v0.27.2","v0.27.2-RC1","v0.27.2-RC2","v0.27.2-RC3","v0.27.3","v0.27.3-RC1","v0.27.3-RC2","v0.27.4","v0.27.4-RC1","v0.27.4-RC2","v0.27.4-RC3","v0.3","v0.4","v0.5","v0.6","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.7","v0.8","v0.9","v0.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-37618.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/1759"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-583f-w9pm-99r2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-06"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FMDT4PJB7P43WSOM3TRQIY3J33BAFVVE/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UYGDELIFFJWKUU7SO3QATCIXCZJERGAC/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
