between sock bind and socket write\niter. bind may free the same cmd via mgmt_pending before write iter sends\nthe cmd, just as syzbot reported in UAF[1].\n\nHere we use hci_dev_lock to synchronize the two, thereby avoiding the\nUAF mentioned in [1].\n\n[1]\nsyzbot reported:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in mgmt_pending_remove+0x3b/0x210 net/bluetooth/mgmt_util.c:316\nRead of size 8 at addr
