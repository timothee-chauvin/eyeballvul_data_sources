For example, the contributor role does not have such rights, but this allowed them to bypass that. This has been patched in WordPress 5.3.1, along with all the previous WordPress versions from 3.7 to 5.3 via a minor release.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress","events":[{"introduced":"3921fd373acaeeeee2029f762b676075cf375b33"},{"fixed":"378daf04727d8124c3a98e2f801632e068c04964"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-20043.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress-develop","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1d1d5be7aa94608c04516cac4238e8c22b93c1d9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-20043.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/commit/1d1d5be7aa94608c04516cac4238e8c22b93c1d9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/security/advisories/GHSA-g7rg-hchx-c2gw"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2020/Jan/8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/12/wordpress-5-3-1-security-and-maintenance-release/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9973"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4599"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4677"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/46893/trunk"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
