Due to an error in the managed-keys feature it is possible for a BIND server which uses managed-keys to exit due to an assertion failure if, during key rollover, a trust anchor's keys are replaced with keys which use an unsupported algorithm. Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -> 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -> 9.11.5-P1, 9.12.0 -> 9.12.3-P1, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.5-S3 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition. Versions 9.13.0 -> 9.13.6 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected. Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability to CVE-2018-5745.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/bind9","events":[{"last_affected":"1c59cea1c0e26e2da3f2afb90200bfe9f7748c03"},{"introduced":"1477c19dd9a347ee19a42dac227f299a4680506f"},{"last_affected":"2fe4344de48d6061bef5a4000066a99a7c1296a6"},{"introduced":"71a40862c0be867999867cd99e21c2266a5e452b"},{"last_affected":"3631aeb0709b460afc66ca8bff609bf93ef24bec"},{"last_affected":"3b0b2047cea8d9e61d0c1eabe2d3c958997e8be4"},{"last_affected":"647dac6f96293b98d9d865d367feb74710cd9b46"},{"last_affected":"6c8e92c06d2d5b5904c925ca48564a93f1edba44"},{"introduced":"29b3a7d84240a51099490c0f39ae537f4e0d6a7a"},{"last_affected":"acfbf1ae9438873ef2fccacd5b3692f1aab99939"},{"last_affected":"cfdd35f26ac4509cec614284ce036e487a552504"},{"introduced":"3514c49b2fbcdf95b2735878e2487fce9a3ddad5"},{"last_affected":"db65d701b999d10e555c13454bceb74df4494975"}]}],"versions":["v9.11.0","v9.11.1","v9.11.1b1","v9.11.1rc1","v9.11.1rc2","v9.11.1rc3","v9.11.2b1","v9.11.2rc1","v9.11.3","v9.11.3b1","v9.11.3rc1","v9.11.4","v9.11.4rc2","v9.13.0","v9.13.2","v9.13.3","v9.13.4","v9.13.5","v9.13.6","v9.9.0","v9.9.1","v9.9.2b1","v9.9.2rc1","v9.9.3b1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-5745.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3552"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2018-5745"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
