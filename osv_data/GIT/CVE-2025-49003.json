Prior to version 2.10.11, a threat actor may take advantage of a feature in Java in which the character \"ı\" becomes \"I\" when converted to uppercase, and the character \"ſ\" becomes \"S\" when converted to uppercase. A threat actor who uses a carefully crafted message that exploits this character conversion can cause remote code execution. The vulnerability has been fixed in v2.10.11. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dataease/dataease","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"872597925338dbf16f6af9e5b66ba4fbb6907514"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.10.10","v2.10.2","v2.10.3","v2.10.4","v2.10.5","v2.10.6","v2.10.7","v2.10.8","v2.10.9","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.6.0","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-49003.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"183003779497483947224845251740197970733","length":241},"id":"CVE-2025-49003-44d1aec3","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/dataease/dataease/commit/872597925338dbf16f6af9e5b66ba4fbb6907514","target":{"file":"core/core-backend/src/main/java/io/dataease/datasource/type/H2.java","function":"getJdbc"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["100456944153765217509785831818021985500","42185638248660599097384144752533775061","262806380832579929368515941997875256289","283362053816985036004927096577222560716","334081505712768125582536326672569134219","159267869677055451445996061063063280061","333487707478739931352209523162417589534","228091582504442549553598166391130391852"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2025-49003-d3b14c21","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/dataease/dataease/commit/872597925338dbf16f6af9e5b66ba4fbb6907514","target":{"file":"core/core-backend/src/main/java/io/dataease/datasource/type/H2.java"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/dataease/dataease/security/advisories/GHSA-x97w-69ff-r55q"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-153"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
