This is achieved by crafting a special config.json (a file within the .keras archive) that will invoke keras.config.enable_unsafe_deserialization() to disable safe mode. Once safe mode is disable, one can use the Lambda layer feature of keras, which allows arbitrary Python code in the form of pickled code. Both can appear in the same archive. Simply the keras.config.enable_unsafe_deserialization() needs to appear first in the archive and the Lambda with arbitrary code needs to be second.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/keras-team/keras","events":[{"introduced":"9c675a9a45e5e8244163fea82efc6066722608a1"},{"fixed":"7bf852c211ea41dc58bbc740c3fe64d091d37511"}]}],"versions":["v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.10.0","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.5.0","v3.6.0","v3.7.0","v3.8.0","v3.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-9906.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/21429"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
