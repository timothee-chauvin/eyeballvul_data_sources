In versions 3.9.17 and lower of vm2 it was possible to get a read-write reference to the node `inspect` method and edit options for `console.log`. As a result a threat actor can edit options for the `console.log` command. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may make the `inspect` method readonly with `vm.readonly(inspect)` after creating a vm.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2f446e5d19e6539b5164b45b1f8bd4ded4dfc085"}]}],"versions":["3.9.10","3.9.11","3.9.12","3.9.13","3.9.14","3.9.15","3.9.16","3.9.17","3.9.3","3.9.4","3.9.5","3.9.6","3.9.7","3.9.8","3.9.9","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v3.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-32313.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-p5gc-c584-jj6v"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/commit/5206ba25afd86ef547a2c9d48d46ca7a9e6ec238"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://gist.github.com/arkark/c1c57eaf3e0a649af1a70c2b93b17550"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/releases/tag/3.9.18"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-74"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
