In versions prior to 1.8.1 superjson allows input to run arbitrary code on any server using superjson input without prior authentication or knowledge. The only requirement is that the server implements at least one endpoint which uses superjson during request processing. This has been patched in superjson 1.8.1. Users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"03129504e89707cb046922cdeb9958d77d275913"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2","0.0.3","0.0.4","0.0.5","0.0.6","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.7.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23631.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5888-ffcr-r425"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson/security/advisories/GHSA-5888-ffcr-r425"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/blitzjs-prototype-pollution/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
