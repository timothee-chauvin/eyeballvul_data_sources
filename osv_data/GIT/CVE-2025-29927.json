Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js","events":[{"introduced":"75b7a57e0f0044d9315eb6adbd4231b67799d0b1"},{"fixed":"6687ab55a362f1fe8cb15a76640cc87ff90d15f2"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"11.1.4"},{"fixed":"12.3.5"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js","events":[{"introduced":"b546d8b22c0f0749022cd84c22e67ec3628eb027"},{"fixed":"d36a1f3c3547b0cb807f30c14aa6250a932349c8"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"14.0.0"},{"fixed":"14.2.25"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js","events":[{"introduced":"51bfe3c1863b191f4b039bc230e8ed5c57b0baf3"},{"fixed":"535e26d3c69de49df8bd17618a424cbe65ec897b"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"15.0.0"},{"fixed":"15.2.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js","events":[{"introduced":"63aab20a2ca4f0340e7ca5baff00a5f261dd12d2"},{"fixed":"422223e929723dfe7a19f3efe22e38929e9fae79"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"13.0.0"},{"fixed":"13.5.9"}]}}],"versions":["v13.0.0","v13.0.1","v13.0.1-canary.0","v13.0.1-canary.1","v13.0.1-canary.2","v13.0.1-canary.3","v13.0.1-canary.4","v13.0.2","v13.0.2-canary.0","v13.0.2-canary.1","v13.0.2-canary.2","v13.0.2-canary.3","v13.0.3","v13.0.3-canary.0","v13.0.3-canary.1","v13.0.3-canary.2","v13.0.3-canary.3","v13.0.3-canary.4","v13.0.4","v13.0.4-canary.0","v13.0.4-canary.1","v13.0.4-canary.2","v13.0.4-canary.3","v13.0.4-canary.4","v13.0.4-canary.5","v13.0.5","v13.0.5-canary.0","v13.0.5-canary.1","v13.0.5-canary.2","v13.0.5-canary.3","v13.0.5-canary.4","v13.0.5-canary.5","v13.0.5-canary.6","v13.0.5-canary.7","v13.0.6","v13.0.6-canary.0","v13.0.6-canary.1","v13.0.6-canary.2","v13.0.6-canary.3","v13.0.6-canary.4","v13.0.7","v13.0.7-canary.0","v13.0.7-canary.1","v13.0.7-canary.2","v13.0.7-canary.3","v13.0.7-canary.4","v13.0.7-canary.5","v13.0.7-canary.6","v13.0.7-canary.7","v13.0.8-canary.0","v13.0.8-canary.1","v13.0.8-canary.2","v13.0.8-canary.3","v13.0.8-canary.4","v13.0.8-canary.5","v13.1.0","v13.1.1","v13.1.1-canary.0","v13.1.1-canary.1","v13.1.2","v13.1.2-canary.0","v13.1.2-canary.1","v13.1.2-canary.2","v13.1.2-canary.3","v13.1.2-canary.4","v13.1.2-canary.5","v13.1.2-canary.6","v13.1.2-canary.7","v13.1.2-canary.8","v13.1.3","v13.1.3-canary.0","v13.1.3-canary.1","v13.1.3-canary.2","v13.1.3-canary.3","v13.1.3-canary.4","v13.1.3-canary.5","v13.1.3-canary.6","v13.1.4","v13.1.4-canary.0","v13.1.4-canary.1","v13.1.5","v13.1.5-canary.0","v13.1.5-canary.1","v13.1.5-canary.2","v13.1.5-canary.3","v13.1.6","v13.1.6-canary.0","v13.1.6-canary.1","v13.1.6-canary.2","v13.1.6-canary.3","v13.1.7-canary.0","v13.1.7-canary.1","v13.1.7-canary.10","v13.1.7-canary.11","v13.1.7-canary.12","v13.1.7-canary.13","v13.1.7-canary.14","v13.1.7-canary.15","v13.1.7-canary.16","v13.1.7-canary.17","v13.1.7-canary.18","v13.1.7-canary.19","v13.1.7-canary.20","v13.1.7-canary.21","v13.1.7-canary.22","v13.1.7-canary.23","v13.1.7-canary.24","v13.1.7-canary.25","v13.1.7-canary.26","v13.1.7-canary.27","v13.1.7-canary.28","v13.1.7-canary.29","v13.1.7-canary.3","v13.1.7-canary.30","v13.1.7-canary.32","v13.1.7-canary.4","v13.1.7-canary.5","v13.1.7-canary.6","v13.1.7-canary.7","v13.1.7-canary.8","v13.1.7-canary.9","v13.2.0","v13.2.1","v13.2.1-canary.0","v13.2.2","v13.2.2-canary.0","v13.2.2-canary.1","v13.2.2-canary.2","v13.2.2-canary.3","v13.2.2-canary.4","v13.2.2-canary.5","v13.2.3","v13.2.3-canary.0","v13.2.3-canary.1","v13.2.4","v13.2.4-canary.0","v13.2.4-canary.1","v13.2.4-canary.2","v13.2.4-canary.3","v13.2.4-canary.4","v13.2.4-canary.5","v13.2.4-canary.6","v13.2.4-canary.7","v13.2.4-canary.8","v13.2.4-canary.9","v13.2.5-canary.0","v13.2.5-canary.10","v13.2.5-canary.11","v13.2.5-canary.12","v13.2.5-canary.13","v13.2.5-canary.14","v13.2.5-canary.15","v13.2.5-canary.16","v13.2.5-canary.17","v13.2.5-canary.18","v13.2.5-canary.19","v13.2.5-canary.2","v13.2.5-canary.20","v13.2.5-canary.21","v13.2.5-canary.22","v13.2.5-canary.23","v13.2.5-canary.24","v13.2.5-canary.25","v13.2.5-canary.26","v13.2.5-canary.27","v13.2.5-canary.28","v13.2.5-canary.29","v13.2.5-canary.3","v13.2.5-canary.30","v13.2.5-canary.31","v13.2.5-canary.32","v13.2.5-canary.33","v13.2.5-canary.34","v13.2.5-canary.4","v13.2.5-canary.5","v13.2.5-canary.6","v13.2.5-canary.7","v13.2.5-canary.8","v13.2.5-canary.9","v13.3.0","v13.3.1","v13.3.1-canary.0","v13.3.1-canary.1","v13.3.1-canary.10","v13.3.1-canary.11","v13.3.1-canary.12","v13.3.1-canary.13","v13.3.1-canary.14","v13.3.1-canary.15","v13.3.1-canary.16","v13.3.1-canary.17","v13.3.1-canary.18","v13.3.1-canary.19","v13.3.1-canary.2","v13.3.1-canary.3","v13.3.1-canary.4","v13.3.1-canary.5","v13.3.1-canary.6","v13.3.1-canary.7","v13.3.1-canary.8","v13.3.1-canary.9","v13.3.2","v13.3.2-canary.0","v13.3.2-canary.1","v13.3.2-canary.10","v13.3.2-canary.11","v13.3.2-canary.12","v13.3.2-canary.13","v13.3.2-canary.14","v13.3.2-canary.2","v13.3.2-canary.3","v13.3.2-canary.4","v13.3.2-canary.5","v13.3.2-canary.6","
