Because of insufficient validation of IPv6 neighbor discovery options in Contiki-NG, attackers can send neighbor solicitation packets that trigger an out-of-bounds read. The problem exists in the module os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c, where memory read operations from the main packet buffer, <code>uip_buf</code>, are not checked if they go out of bounds. In particular, this problem can occur when attempting to read the 2-byte option header and the Source Link-Layer Address Option (SLLAO). This attack requires ipv6 be enabled for the network. The problem has been patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG. The upcoming 4.8 release of Contiki-NG will include the patch.Users unable to upgrade may apply the patch in Contiki-NG PR #1654.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9771e9aaebbfbb5633ce69eb9876e0fc70bbcd6f"}]}],"versions":["2.0","2.1","2.2","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.3","2.4","2.5-release","2.6","2.6-rc0","3.x","develop/v3.x-fork","develop/v4.0","develop/v4.1","develop/v4.2","develop/v4.3","develop/v4.4","develop/v4.5","develop/v4.6","develop/v4.7","develop/v4.8","fork","old/v2.0","old/v2.1","old/v2.2","old/v2.2.1","old/v2.2.2","old/v2.2.3","old/v2.3","old/v2.4","old/v2.6","release/v4.0","release/v4.1","release/v4.2","release/v4.3","release/v4.4","release/v4.5","release/v4.6","release/v4.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35926.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-4hpq-4f53-w386"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1654"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1654/commits/a4597001d50a04f4b9c78f323ba731e2f979802c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/releases/tag/release%2Fv4.8"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-125"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
