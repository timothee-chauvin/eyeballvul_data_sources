In versions prior to 8.0 incorrect regular expressions allow to upload PHP scripts to config/templates/pdf. This vulnerability could lead to a Remote Code Execution if the /config/templates/pdf/ directory is accessible for remote users. This is not a default configuration of LAM. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ldapaccountmanager/lam","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"cb97baae7b1aadffd1b54d0bbcb487a5ca769823"}]}],"versions":["lam_5_4","lam_5_4_RC1","lam_5_5","lam_5_5_RC1","lam_5_6","lam_5_6_RC1","lam_5_7","lam_5_7_RC1","lam_6_0","lam_6_0_1","lam_6_0_RC1","lam_6_0_RC2","lam_6_1","lam_6_1_RC1","lam_6_2","lam_6_2_1","lam_6_2_RC1","lam_6_3","lam_6_3_RC1","lam_6_4","lam_6_4_RC1","lam_6_5","lam_6_5_RC1","lam_6_6","lam_6_6_RC1","lam_6_7","lam_6_7_RC1","lam_6_8","lam_6_8_RC1","lam_6_9","lam_6_9_RC1","lam_7_0","lam_7_0_RC1","lam_7_1","lam_7_1_RC1","lam_7_2","lam_7_2_RC1","lam_7_3","lam_7_3_RC1","lam_7_4","lam_7_4_RC1","lam_7_5","lam_7_5_RC1","lam_7_6","lam_7_6_RC1","lam_7_7","lam_7_7_RC1","lam_7_8","lam_7_8_RC1","lam_7_9","lam_7_9_1","lam_7_9_RC1","lam_8_0_RC1","untagged-0f11e4b04e249cac51c5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31086.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/security/advisories/GHSA-q9pc-x84w-982x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5177"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/commit/f1d5d04952f39a1b4ea203d3964fa88e1429dfd4"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-74"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
