  "summary": "URL globbing out of bounds read",
  "details": "curl supports \"globbing\" of URLs, in which a user can pass a numerical range\nto have the tool iterate over those numbers to do a sequence of transfers.\n\nIn the globbing function that parses the numerical range, there was an\nomission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if given a\ncarefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is stored in a heap\nbased buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read something else instead\nof crashing.\n\nAn example of a URL that triggers the flaw would be\n`http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`.",
