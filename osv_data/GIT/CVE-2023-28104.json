In versions 4.2.2 and 4.1.1, an attacker could use a specially crafted graphql query to execute a denial of service attack against a website which has a publicly exposed graphql endpoint.

Users should upgrade to `silverstripe/graphql` 4.2.3 or 4.1.2 to remedy the vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1d360f246a74884efdbd1f08bb45c583bdf61a2a"}]}],"versions":["0.2.1","0.2.2","0.2.3","0.2.4","0.2.5","0.2.6","0.2.7","1.0.0","1.0.0-rc1","1.0.0-rc2","1.0.0-rc3","1.0.1","1.0.1-rc1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.1.0","1.1.0-rc1","1.1.0-rc2","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","2.0.0","2.0.0-beta1","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","3.0.0","3.0.0-rc1","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.1.0-rc1","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.1.4","3.1.5","3.2.0","3.2.0-alpha1","3.2.0-rc1","3.2.0-rc2","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.3.0-beta1","3.3.0-rc1","4.0.0","4.0.0-alpha1","4.0.0-alpha2","4.0.0-alpha3","4.0.0-beta1","4.0.0-rc1","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.1.0","4.1.0-beta1","4.1.0-rc1","4.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-28104.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/28xxx/CVE-2023-28104.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql/pull/526"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql/releases/tag/4.1.2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql/releases/tag/4.2.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql/security/advisories/GHSA-67g8-c724-8mp3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28104"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/28xxx/CVE-2023-28104.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
