In versions 21.0.0 through 24.0.0, specific multithreaded implementations may encounter memory issues as threads are not properly cleaned up after requests are completed. Over time, this can degrade performance and availability in long-running applications and may result in a denial-of-service condition under sustained load. In addition to using the affected versions, users may be at risk if they are implementing a long-running application using the ApiClient in a multi-threaded manner. This issue is fixed in version 24.0.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-java","events":[{"introduced":"09fc695b57262b9b9cd667f00c51f03cba0ae029"},{"fixed":"c103c1340e673d1f534243d25f37f63a4cd9065f"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66033.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66033.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-java/commit/1daa9229a70fc38fb252aeaa637f82d0b0729b3f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-java/security/advisories/GHSA-qhr6-6cgv-6638"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66033"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-401"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66033.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
