If the caller is do_reset() or do_hard_reset(),\nthey will release the resources on the next reset.\n\nThis fixes following crash that occurred when running the drmgr command\nseveral times to add/remove a vnic interface:\n\n\t[102056] ibmvnic 30000003 env3: Disabling rx_scrq[6] irq\n\t[102056] ibmvnic 30000003 env3: Disabling rx_scrq[7] irq\n\t[102056] ibmvnic 30000003 env3: Replenished 8 pools\n\tKernel attempted to read user page (10) - exploit attempt?
