One example is ZONE_DEVICE\npages: they map PFNs directly, and they don't allocate page_ext at all\neven if there's struct page around.  One may reference\ndevm_memremap_pages().\n\nWhen both ZONE_DEVICE and page-table-check enabled, then try to map some\ndax memories, one can trigger kernel bug constantly now when the kernel\nwas trying to inject some pfn maps on the dax device:\n\n kernel BUG at mm/page_table_check.c:55!\n\nWhile it's pretty legal to use set_pxx_at() for ZONE_DEVICE pages for page\nfault resolutions, skip all the checks if page_ext doesn't even exist in\npgtable checker, which applies to ZONE_DEVICE but maybe more.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"df4e817b710809425d899340dbfa8504a3ca4ba5"},{"fixed":"51897f99351fff7b57f4f141940fa93b4e90fd2b"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"df4e817b710809425d899340dbfa8504a3ca4ba5"},{"fixed":"84d3549d54f5ff9fa3281257be3019386f51d1a0"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"df4e817b710809425d899340dbfa8504a3ca4ba5"},{"fixed":"dec2382247860d2134c8d41e103e26460c099629"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"df4e817b710809425d899340dbfa8504a3ca4ba5"},{"fixed":"8bb592c2eca8fd2bc06db7d80b38da18da4a2f43"}]}],"versions":["v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.4","v6.6.5","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7","v6.9.1","v6.9.2","v6.9.3","v6.9.4","v6.9.5","v6.9.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-40948.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.96"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.36"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.9.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-40948.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/51897f99351fff7b57f4f141940fa93b4e90fd2b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/84d3549d54f5ff9fa3281257be3019386f51d1a0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8bb592c2eca8fd2bc06db7d80b38da18da4a2f43"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dec2382247860d2134c8d41e103e26460c099629"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/01/msg00001.html"}]}
