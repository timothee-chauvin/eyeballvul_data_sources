{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-30255","published":"2024-04-04T19:41:02Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:42:41.671177Z","aliases":["BIT-envoy-2024-30255","GHSA-j654-3ccm-vfmm"],"summary":"HTTP/2: CPU exhaustion due to CONTINUATION frame flood","details":"Envoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. The HTTP/2 protocol stack in Envoy versions prior to 1.29.3, 1.28.2, 1.27.4, and 1.26.8 are vulnerable to CPU exhaustion due to flood of CONTINUATION frames. Envoy's HTTP/2 codec allows the client to send an unlimited number of CONTINUATION frames even after exceeding Envoy's header map limits. This allows an attacker to send a sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set causing CPU utilization, consuming approximately 1 core per 300Mbit/s of traffic and culminating in denial of service through CPU exhaustion. Users should upgrade to version 1.29.3, 1.28.2, 1.27.4, or 1.26.8 to mitigate the effects of the CONTINUATION flood. As a workaround, disable HTTP/2 protocol for downstream connections.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"a6d1d66a62b985baed414ba90ad0daebfc074664"},{"fixed":"10e1e425fd84cc2cde985179655da08f68c9cb30"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"b5ca88acee3453c9459474b8f22215796eff4dde"},{"fixed":"aecedd842dd24f208a40e39898ab376967fee308"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"7bba38b743bb3bca22dffb4a21c38ccc155fbef8"},{"fixed":"9134d6a65e5c2c714d503807eb31a8490471fc5f"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1257d4e845ff7c5075b03d7ccbfa4767aa295279"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.17.0","v1.18.0","v1.18.1","v1.18.2","v1.19.0","v1.2.0","v1.20.0","v1.21.0","v1.22.0","v1.23.0","v1.24.0","v1.25.0","v1.26.0","v1.26.1","v1.26.2","v1.26.3","v1.26.4","v1.26.5","v1.26.6","v1.26.7","v1.27.0","v1.27.1","v1.27.2","v1.27.3","v1.28.0","v1.28.1","v1.29.0","v1.29.1","v1.29.2","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-30255.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-j654-3ccm-vfmm"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/05/3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-390"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
