Versions prior to 2.2.2 contain an XSS vulnerability that allows authenticated users to upload .html files. An attacker could execute client side scripts **if** another user opened a link. The attacker could potentially take over the account of the user that clicked the link. The Gotify UI won't natively expose such a malicious link, so an attacker has to get the user to open the malicious link in a context outside of Gotify. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 2.2.2. As a workaround, you can block access to non image files via a reverse proxy in the `./image` directory.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gotify/server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"056cd5ecb7f30d9d4feacb2e79c904c71fdbb066"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.1.8","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.10","v2.0.11","v2.0.12","v2.0.13","v2.0.14","v2.0.15","v2.0.16","v2.0.17","v2.0.18","v2.0.19","v2.0.2","v2.0.20","v2.0.21","v2.0.22","v2.0.23","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.0.9","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.1.6","v2.1.7","v2.2.0","v2.2.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-46181.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/gotify/server/pull/534"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/gotify/server/pull/535"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/gotify/server/security/advisories/GHSA-xv6x-456v-24xh"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
