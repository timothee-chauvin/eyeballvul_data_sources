However now it depends on whether the interrupt service routine\ndrm_sched_fault is executed after gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start is completed which sets the ready\nfield of the scheduler to true even  for uninitialized schedulers and causes oops vs\nno fault or when ISR  drm_sched_fault is completed prior  gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start and\nNULL pointer dereference does not occur.\n\nUse the field timeout_wq  to prevent oops for uninitialized schedulers.\nThe field could be initialized by the work queue of resetting the domain.\n\nv1: Corrections to commit message (Luben)","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"11b3b9f461c5c4f700f6c8da202fcc2fd6418e1f"},{"fixed":"c43a96fc00b662cef1ef0eb22d40441ce2abae8f"},{"fixed":"2da5bffe9eaa5819a868e8eaaa11b3fd0f16a691"}]}],"versions":["v6.3","v6.3-rc7","v6.3.1","v6.3.2","v6.3.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53351.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.3.0"},{"fixed":"6.3.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53351.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2da5bffe9eaa5819a868e8eaaa11b3fd0f16a691"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c43a96fc00b662cef1ef0eb22d40441ce2abae8f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53351.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53351"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53351.json"}}
