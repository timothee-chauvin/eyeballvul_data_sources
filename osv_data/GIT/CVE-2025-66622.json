Versions 0.14.1 and prior are unable to handle responses that include custom m.room.join_rules values due to a serialization bug. This can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service condition, if a user is invited to a room with non-standard join rules, the crate's sync process will stall, preventing further processing for all rooms. This is fixed in version 0.16.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"742a0db07bde3afd049077e7962948111473e1e1"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.1-qrcode","0.7.1-sqlite","0.7.2-crypto","0f","matrix-qrcode-0.2.0","matrix-sdk-0.10.0","matrix-sdk-0.11.0","matrix-sdk-0.12.0","matrix-sdk-0.13.0","matrix-sdk-0.14.0","matrix-sdk-0.4.0","matrix-sdk-0.4.1","matrix-sdk-0.5.0","matrix-sdk-0.6.0","matrix-sdk-0.8.0","matrix-sdk-0.9.0","matrix-sdk-base-0.10.0","matrix-sdk-base-0.11.0","matrix-sdk-base-0.12.0","matrix-sdk-base-0.13.0","matrix-sdk-base-0.14.0","matrix-sdk-base-0.14.1","matrix-sdk-base-0.4.0","matrix-sdk-base-0.4.1","matrix-sdk-base-0.5.0","matrix-sdk-base-0.5.1","matrix-sdk-base-0.6.0","matrix-sdk-base-0.8.0","matrix-sdk-base-0.9.0","matrix-sdk-common-0.10.0","matrix-sdk-common-0.11.0","matrix-sdk-common-0.12.0","matrix-sdk-common-0.13.0","matrix-sdk-common-0.14.0","matrix-sdk-common-0.4.0","matrix-sdk-common-0.4.1","matrix-sdk-common-0.5.0","matrix-sdk-common-0.6.0","matrix-sdk-common-0.8.0","matrix-sdk-common-0.9.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-0.10.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-0.11.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-0.11.1","matrix-sdk-crypto-0.12.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-0.13.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-0.14.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-0.4.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-0.4.1","matrix-sdk-crypto-0.5.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-0.6.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-0.8.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-0.9.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.1.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.1.1","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.1.10","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.1.2","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.1.3","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.1.4","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.1.5","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.1.6","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.1.7","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.1.8","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.1.9","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.11.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.11.1","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.2.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.2.1","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.3.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.3.1","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.3.10","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.3.11","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.3.12","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.3.13","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.3.2","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.3.4","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.3.5","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.3.6","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.3.7","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.3.8","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.3.9","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.4.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.4.1","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.4.2","matrix-sdk-crypto-ffi-0.4.3","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-0.1.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-0.1.0-alpha.10","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-0.1.0-alpha.6","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-0.1.0-alpha.8","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-0.1.0-alpha.9","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-0.1.2","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-0.1.3","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-0.1.4","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-v0.1.0-alpha.0","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-v0.1.0-alpha.1","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-v0.1.0-alpha.2","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-v0.1.0-alpha.3","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-v0.1.0-alpha.4","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-v0.1.0-alpha.5","matrix-sdk-crypto-js-v0.1.0-alpha.6","matrix-sdk-crypto-nodejs-v0.1.0-beta.0","matrix-sdk-ffi-0.11.0","matrix-sdk-ffi-0.12.0","matrix-sdk-ffi-0.13.0","matrix-sdk-ffi-0.14.0","matrix-sdk-ffi/20240618","matrix-sdk-ffi/20240704","matrix-sdk-ffi/20240722","matrix-sdk-ffi/20240813","matrix-sdk-ffi/20240827","matrix-sdk-ffi/20240904","matrix-sdk-ffi/20240911","matrix-sdk-ffi/20240913","matrix-sdk-ffi/20240918","matrix-sdk-ffi/20240924","matrix-sdk-ffi/20241008","matrix-sdk-ffi/20241024","matrix-sdk-ffi/20241107","matrix-sdk-ffi/20241127","matrix-sdk-ffi/20241203","matrix-sdk-ffi/20241204","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250131","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250225","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250306","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250320","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250325","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250408","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250422","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250506","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250507","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250521","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250603","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250618","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250701","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250702","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250715","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250728","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250826","matrix-sdk-ffi/20250909","matrix-sdk-ffi/20251007","matrix-sdk-ffi/20251104","matrix-sdk-ffi/20251118","matrix-sdk-ffi/20252502","matrix-sdk-indexeddb-0.1.0","matrix-sdk-indexeddb-0.10.0","matrix-sdk-indexeddb-0.11.0","matrix-sdk-indexeddb-0.12.0","matrix-sdk-indexeddb-0.13.0","matrix-sdk-indexeddb-0.14.0","matrix-sdk-indexeddb-0.2.0","matrix-sdk-indexeddb-0.8.0","matrix-sdk-indexeddb-0.9.0","matrix-sdk-qrcode-0.10.0","matrix-sdk-qrcode-0.11.0","matrix-sdk-qrcode-0.12.0","matrix-sdk-qrcode-0.13.0","matrix-sdk-qrcode-0.14.0","matrix-sdk-qrcode-0.3.0","matrix-sdk-qrcode-0.4.0","matrix-sdk-qrcode-0.8.0","matrix-sdk-qrcode-0.9.0","matrix-sdk-search-0.14.0","matrix-sdk-sled-0.1.0","matrix-sdk-sled-0.2.0","matrix-sdk-sqlite-0.10.0","matrix-sdk-sqlite-0.11.0","matrix-sdk-sqlite-0.12.0","matrix-sdk-sqlite-0.13.0","matrix-sdk-sqlite-0.14.0","matrix-sdk-sqlite-0.8.0","matrix-sdk-sqlite-0.9.0","matrix-sdk-store-encryption-0.1.0","matrix-sdk-store-encryption-0.10.0","matrix-sdk-store-encryption-0.11.0","matrix-sdk-store-encryption-0.12.0","matrix-sdk-
