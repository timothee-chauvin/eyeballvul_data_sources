Versions 0.56.0 and below are vulnerable to excessive memory allocation through quic-go's HTTP/3 client and server implementations by sending a QPACK-encoded HEADERS frame that decodes into a large header field section (many unique header names and/or large values). The implementation builds an http.Header (used on the http.Request and http.Response, respectively), while only enforcing limits on the size of the (QPACK-compressed) HEADERS frame, but not on the decoded header, leading to memory exhaustion. This issue is fixed in version 0.57.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5b2d2129f8315da41e01eff0a847ab38a34e83a8"}]}],"versions":["v.0.21","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.22.0","v0.23.0","v0.24.0","v0.25.0","v0.26.0","v0.27.0","v0.28.0","v0.28.1","v0.29.0","v0.30.0","v0.31.0","v0.31.1","v0.32.0","v0.33.0","v0.34.0","v0.35.0","v0.35.1","v0.36.0","v0.37.0","v0.37.1","v0.38.0","v0.38.1","v0.39.0","v0.4","v0.40.0","v0.41.0","v0.42.0","v0.43.0","v0.44.0","v0.45.0","v0.46.0","v0.47.0","v0.48.0","v0.48.1","v0.49.0","v0.5.0","v0.50.0","v0.51.0","v0.52.0","v0.53.0","v0.54.0","v0.55.0","v0.56.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64702.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64702.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/commit/5b2d2129f8315da41e01eff0a847ab38a34e83a8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/security/advisories/GHSA-g754-hx8w-x2g6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64702"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64702.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
