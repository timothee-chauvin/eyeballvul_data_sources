Prior to version 6.3.23, XSLT transforms performed by various components are vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where org.hl7.fhir.core is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. This issue has been patched in release 6.3.23. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/hl7/fhir-ig-publisher","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"33e2566af5b442c6565664e1152763ce0f8caac3"}]}],"versions":["1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.10","1.1.100","1.1.101","1.1.102","1.1.103","1.1.104","1.1.105","1.1.106","1.1.107","1.1.108","1.1.109","1.1.11","1.1.110","1.1.111","1.1.112","1.1.113","1.1.114","1.1.115","1.1.116","1.1.117","1.1.118","1.1.119","1.1.12","1.1.120","1.1.121","1.1.122","1.1.123","1.1.124","1.1.125","1.1.126","1.1.127","1.1.128","1.1.129","1.1.13","1.1.130","1.1.131","1.1.14","1.1.15","1.1.16","1.1.17","1.1.18","1.1.19","1.1.2","1.1.20","1.1.21","1.1.22","1.1.23","1.1.24","1.1.25","1.1.26","1.1.27","1.1.3","1.1.32","1.1.33","1.1.34","1.1.35","1.1.37","1.1.38","1.1.39","1.1.4","1.1.40","1.1.41","1.1.42","1.1.43","1.1.44","1.1.45","1.1.47","1.1.48","1.1.5","1.1.50","1.1.51","1.1.53","1.1.54","1.1.55","1.1.56","1.1.57","1.1.58","1.1.59","1.1.6","1.1.60","1.1.61","1.1.62","1.1.63","1.1.64","1.1.65","1.1.66","1.1.67","1.1.68","1.1.7","1.1.71","1.1.72","1.1.73","1.1.74","1.1.75","1.1.76","1.1.77","1.1.78","1.1.79","1.1.8","1.1.80","1.1.81","1.1.82","1.1.83","1.1.84","1.1.85","1.1.86","1.1.87","1.1.88","1.1.89","1.1.9","1.1.90","1.1.91","1.1.92","1.1.93","1.1.94","1.1.95","1.1.96","1.1.97","1.1.98","1.1.99","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.10","1.2.11","1.2.12","1.2.13","1.2.14","1.2.15","1.2.17","1.2.18","1.2.19","1.2.2","1.2.20","1.2.21","1.2.22","1.2.23","1.2.24","1.2.25","1.2.26","1.2.27","1.2.28","1.2.29","1.2.3","1.2.30","1.2.31","1.2.32","1.2.33","1.2.34","1.2.35","1.2.36","1.2.37","1.2.38","1.2.39","1.2.4","1.2.40","1.2.41","1.2.42","1.2.43","1.2.44","1.2.45","1.2.46","1.2.47","1.2.48","1.2.49","1.2.5","1.2.50","1.2.51","1.2.52","1.2.53","1.2.54","1.2.6","1.2.7","1.2.8","1.2.9","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.10","1.3.11","1.3.12","1.3.13","1.3.14","1.3.15","1.3.16","1.3.17","1.3.18","1.3.19","1.3.2","1.3.20","1.3.21","1.3.22","1.3.23","1.3.24","1.3.25","1.3.26","1.3.27","1.3.28","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.5","1.3.6","1.3.7","1.3.8","1.3.9","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.10","1.4.11","1.4.12","1.4.13","1.4.14","1.4.15","1.4.16","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.4.8","1.4.9","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.5.10","1.5.11","1.5.12","1.5.13","1.5.14","1.5.15","1.5.16","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.4","1.5.5","1.5.6","1.5.8","1.5.9","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.10","1.6.11","1.6.12","1.6.13","1.6.14","1.6.15","1.6.16","1.6.17","1.6.18","1.6.19","1.6.2","1.6.20","1.6.21","1.6.3","1.6.4","1.6.5","1.6.6","1.6.7","1.6.8","1.6.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45294.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2721ebb8c60b20b94cb1f29f9469afbae7c0caf6"}]}],"versions":["1.1.67","5.0.10","5.0.11","5.0.12","5.0.13","5.0.14","5.0.15","5.0.16","5.0.17","5.0.18","5.0.19","5.0.20","5.0.21","5.0.22","5.0.6","5.0.7","5.0.8","5.0.9","5.1.1","5.1.10","5.1.11","5.1.12","5.1.13","5.1.14","5.1.15","5.1.16","5.1.17","5.1.18","5.1.19","5.1.2","5.1.20","5.1.21","5.1.22","5.1.3","5.1.4","5.1.5","5.1.6","5.1.7","5.1.8","5.1.9","5.2.1","5.2.10","5.2.11","5.2.12","5.2.13","5.2.16","5.2.18","5.2.19","5.2.20","5.2.3","5.2.4","5.2.5","5.2.7","5.2.9","5.3.1","5.3.10","5.3.11","5.3.12","5.3.14","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.3.4","5.3.5","5.3.6","5.3.7","5.3.8","5.3.9","5.4.1","5.4.10","5.4.11","5.4.12","5.4.2","5.4.3","5.4.4","5.4.5","5.4.6","5.4.7","5.4.8","5.4.9","5.5.1","5.5.10","5.5.11","5.5.12","5.5.13","5.5.14","5.5.15","5.5.3","5.5.4","5.5.6","5.5.7","5.5.8","5.5.9","5.6.0","5.6.1","5.6.100","5.6.101","5.6.102","5.6.103","5.6.104","5.6.105","5.6.106","5.6.107","5.6.108","5.6.109","5.6.110","5.6.111","5.6.112","5.6.113","5.6.114","5.6.115","5.6.116","5.6.117","5.6.15","5.6.17","5.6.18","5.6.19","5.6.20","5.6.21","5.6.22","5.6.23","5.6.24","5.6.25","5.6.26","5.6.27","5.6.28","5.6.29","5.6.3","5.6.30","5.6.31","5.6.32","5.6.33","5.6.34","5.6.35","5.6.36","5.6.37","5.6.38","5.6.39","5.6.4","5.6.40","5.6.41","5.6.42","5.6.43","5.6.44","5.6.45","5.6.46","5.6.47","5.6.48","5.6.5","5.6.50","5.6.51","5.6.52","5.6.53","5.6.54","5.6.55","5.6.56","5.6.57","5.6.58","5.6.59","5.6.6","5.6.60","5.6.61","5.6.62","5.6.63","5.6.64","5.6.65","5.6.66","5.6.67","5.6.68","5.6.69","5.6.7","5.6.70","5.6.71","5.6.72","5.6.73","5.6.74","5.6.75","5.6.76","5.6.77","5.6.78","5.6.79","5.6.80","5.6.81","5.6.82","5.6.83","5.6.84","5.6.85","5.6.86","5.6.87","5.6.88","5.6.89","5.6.9","5.6.90","5.6.91","5.6.92","5.6.93","5.6.94","5.6.95","5.6.96","5.6.97","5.6.98","5.6.99","6.0.0","6.0.1","6.0.10","6.0.11","6.0.12","6.0.13","6.0.14","6.0.15","6.0.16","6.0.17","6.0.18","6.0.19","6.0.2","6.0.20","6.0.21","6.0.22","6.0.23","6.0.24","6.0.25","6.0.3","6.0.4","6.0.5","6.0.6","6.0.7","6.0.8","6.0.9","6.1.0","6.1.1","6.1.10","6.1.11","6.1.12","6.1.13","6.1.14","6.1.15","6.1.16","6.1.2","6.1.3","6.1.4","6.1.5","6.1.6","6.1.7","6.1.8","6.1.9","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.2.10","6.2.11","6.2.12","6.2.13","6.2
