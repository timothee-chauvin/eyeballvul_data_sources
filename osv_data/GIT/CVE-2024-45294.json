Prior to version 6.3.23, XSLT transforms performed by various components are vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where org.hl7.fhir.core is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. This issue has been patched in release 6.3.23. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/hl7/fhir-ig-publisher","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"33e2566af5b442c6565664e1152763ce0f8caac3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45294.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2721ebb8c60b20b94cb1f29f9469afbae7c0caf6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45294.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/releases/tag/1.6.22"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/security/advisories/GHSA-59rq-22fm-x8q5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/releases/tag/6.3.23"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/security/advisories/GHSA-6cr6-ph3p-f5rf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-611"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
