{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-61913","published":"2025-10-08T22:43:24Z","modified":"2025-11-14T19:40:35.897670Z","aliases":["GHSA-jv9m-vf54-chjj"],"related":["GHSA-j44m-5v8f-gc9c","GHSA-jv9m-vf54-chjj"],"summary":"Flowise is vulnerable to arbitrary file read, arbitrary file write","details":"Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In versions prior to 3.0.8, WriteFileTool and ReadFileTool in Flowise do not restrict file path access, allowing authenticated attackers to exploit this vulnerability to read and write arbitrary files to any path in the file system, potentially leading to remote command execution. Flowise 3.0.8 fixes this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/flowiseai/flowise","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ac794ab6eb8025144d044013f75b07c75ca938b8"}]}],"versions":["flowise-components@1.0.0","flowise-components@1.1.0","flowise-components@1.1.1","flowise-components@1.2.1","flowise-components@1.2.10","flowise-components@1.2.11","flowise-components@1.2.12","flowise-components@1.2.13","flowise-components@1.2.14","flowise-components@1.2.15","flowise-components@1.2.16","flowise-components@1.2.17","flowise-components@1.2.2","flowise-components@1.2.3","flowise-components@1.2.4","flowise-components@1.2.5","flowise-components@1.2.6","flowise-components@1.2.7","flowise-components@1.2.8","flowise-components@1.2.9","flowise-components@1.3.0","flowise-components@1.3.1","flowise-components@1.3.10","flowise-components@1.3.11","flowise-components@1.3.2","flowise-components@1.3.3","flowise-components@1.3.4","flowise-components@1.3.5","flowise-components@1.3.7","flowise-components@1.3.8","flowise-components@1.3.9","flowise-components@1.4.0","flowise-components@1.4.0-rc.1","flowise-components@1.4.1","flowise-components@1.4.2","flowise-components@1.4.3","flowise-components@1.4.6","flowise-components@1.4.7","flowise-components@1.4.8","flowise-components@1.4.9","flowise-components@1.5.0","flowise-components@1.5.1","flowise-components@1.5.2","flowise-components@1.5.3","flowise-components@1.6.0","flowise-components@1.6.1","flowise-components@1.6.2","flowise-components@1.6.3","flowise-components@1.6.4","flowise-components@1.6.5","flowise-components@1.6.6","flowise-components@1.6.7","flowise-components@1.6.8","flowise-components@1.7.0","flowise-components@1.7.1","flowise-components@1.7.2","flowise-components@1.8.0","flowise-components@1.8.1","flowise-components@1.8.3","flowise-components@1.8.4","flowise-components@1.8.6","flowise-components@2.0.2","flowise-components@2.0.3","flowise-components@2.0.4","flowise-components@2.0.5","flowise-components@2.0.6","flowise-components@2.0.7","flowise-components@2.1.0","flowise-components@2.1.1","flowise-components@2.1.2","flowise-components@2.1.3","flowise-components@2.1.4","flowise-components@2.1.5","flowise-components@2.2.0","flowise-components@2.2.1","flowise-components@2.2.2","flowise-components@2.2.3","flowise-components@2.2.4","flowise-components@2.2.5","flowise-components@2.2.6","flowise-components@2.2.7","flowise-components@2.2.7-patch.1","flowise-components@2.2.8","flowise-components@3.0.0","flowise-components@3.0.1","flowise-components@3.0.2","flowise-components@3.0.3","flowise-components@3.0.4","flowise-components@3.0.5","flowise-components@3.0.6","flowise-components@3.0.7","flowise-ui@1.0.0","flowise-ui@1.1.0","flowise-ui@1.2.0","flowise-ui@1.2.1","flowise-ui@1.2.10","flowise-ui@1.2.11","flowise-ui@1.2.12","flowise-ui@1.2.13","flowise-ui@1.2.14","flowise-ui@1.2.15","flowise-ui@1.2.2","flowise-ui@1.2.3","flowise-ui@1.2.4","flowise-ui@1.2.5","flowise-ui@1.2.6","flowise-ui@1.2.7","flowise-ui@1.2.9","flowise-ui@1.3.0","flowise-ui@1.3.1","flowise-ui@1.3.2","flowise-ui@1.3.3","flowise-ui@1.3.4","flowise-ui@1.3.5","flowise-ui@1.3.6","flowise-ui@1.3.7","flowise-ui@1.4.0","flowise-ui@1.4.0-rc.1","flowise-ui@1.4.1","flowise-ui@1.4.2","flowise-ui@1.4.3","flowise-ui@1.4.4","flowise-ui@1.4.5","flowise-ui@1.4.6","flowise-ui@1.4.7","flowise-ui@1.4.8","flowise-ui@1.4.9","flowise-ui@1.5.0","flowise-ui@1.5.1","flowise-ui@1.6.0","flowise-ui@1.6.1","flowise-ui@1.6.2","flowise-ui@1.6.3","flowise-ui@1.6.4","flowise-ui@1.6.5","flowise-ui@1.6.6","flowise-ui@1.7.0","flowise-ui@1.7.1","flowise-ui@1.7.2","flowise-ui@1.8.0","flowise-ui@1.8.1","flowise-ui@1.8.2","flowise-ui@1.8.3","flowise-ui@1.8.4","flowise-ui@2.0.2","flowise-ui@2.0.3","flowise-ui@2.0.4","flowise-ui@2.0.5","flowise-ui@2.0.6","flowise-ui@2.0.7","flowise-ui@2.1.0","flowise-ui@2.1.1","flowise-ui@2.1.2","flowise-ui@2.1.3","flowise-ui@2.1.4","flowise-ui@2.1.5","flowise-ui@2.2.0","flowise-ui@2.2.1","flowise-ui@2.2.2","flowise-ui@2.2.3","flowise-ui@2.2.4","flowise-ui@2.2.5","flowise-ui@2.2.6","flowise-ui@2.2.7","flowise-ui@2.2.7-patch.1","flowise-ui@2.2.8","flowise-ui@3.0.0","flowise-ui@3.0.1","flowise-ui@3.0.2","flowise-ui@3.0.3","flowise-ui@3.0.4","flowise-ui@3.0.5","flowise-ui@3.0.6","flowise-ui@3.0.7","flowise@1.0.0","flowise@1.0.1","flowise@1.1.0","flowise@1.1.1","flowise@1.2.1","flowise@1.2.10","flowise@1.2.11","flowise@1.2.12","flowise@1.2.13","flowise@1.2.14","flowise@1.2.15","flowise@1.2.16","flowise@1.2.2","flowise@1.2.3","flowise@1.2.4","flowise@1.2.5","flowise@1.2.6","flowise@1.2.7","flowise@1.2.8","flowise@1.2.9","flowise@1.3.0","flowise@1.3.1","flowise@1.3.2","flowise@1.3.3","flowise@1.3.4","flowise@1.3.5","flowise@1.3.6","flowise@1.3.7","flowise@1.3.8","flowise@1.3.9","flowise@1.4.0","flowise@1.4.0-rc.1","flowise@1.4.1","flowise@1.4.10","flowise@1.4.11","flowise@1.4.12","flowise@1.4.2","flowise@1.4.3","flowise@1.4.4","flowise@1.4.5","flowise@1.4.6","flowise@1.4.7","flowise@1.4.8","flowise@1.4.9","flowise@
