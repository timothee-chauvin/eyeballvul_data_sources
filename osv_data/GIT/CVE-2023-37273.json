Running Auto-GPT version prior to 0.4.3 by cloning the git repo and executing `docker compose run auto-gpt` in the repo root uses a different docker-compose.yml file from the one suggested in the official docker set up instructions. The docker-compose.yml file located in the repo root mounts itself into the docker container without write protection. This means that if malicious custom python code is executed via the `execute_python_file` and `execute_python_code` commands, it can overwrite the docker-compose.yml file and abuse it to gain control of the host system the next time Auto-GPT is started. The issue has been patched in version 0.4.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/significant-gravitas/auto-gpt","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"80151dd6b2870dc6f91aafadb3a451f2e440a3ba"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3-alpha"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-37273.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/security/advisories/GHSA-x5gj-2chr-4ch6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/4761"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
