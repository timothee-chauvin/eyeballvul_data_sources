Instead of polling the\nregisters, software can wait until the low latency interrupt is fired.\n\nThis logic makes use of the Tx timestamp tracking structure, ice_ptp_tx, as\nit uses the same \"ready\" bitmap to track which Tx timestamps complete.\n\nUnfortunately, the ice_ll_ts_intr() function does not check if the\ntracker is initialized before its first access. This results in NULL\ndereference or use-after-free bugs similar to the issues fixed in the\nice_ptp_ts_irq() function.\n\nFix this by only checking the in_use bitmap (and other fields) if the\ntracker is marked as initialized. The reset flow will clear the init field\nunder lock before it tears the tracker down, thus preventing any\nuse-after-free or NULL access.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"82e71b226e0ef770d7bc143701c8b4960b4eb3d5"},{"fixed":"2cde98a02da958357fe240a6ba269b69d913b6ba"},{"fixed":"923c267bdbb64f65bc1149d184efcf8b047d7d64"},{"fixed":"f6486338fde3f04ed0ec59fe67a69a208c32734f"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.16.1","v6.16.2","v6.16.3","v6.16.4","v6.16.5","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.7","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39854.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.46"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39854.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2cde98a02da958357fe240a6ba269b69d913b6ba"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/923c267bdbb64f65bc1149d184efcf8b047d7d64"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f6486338fde3f04ed0ec59fe67a69a208c32734f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/39xxx/CVE-2025-39854.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39854"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/39xxx/CVE-2025-39854.json"}}
