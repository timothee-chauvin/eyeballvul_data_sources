Whenever an admin generates a database backup, the backup is stored in the web root while the file name has a format of \"opensisBackup<date>.sql\" (e.g. \"opensisBackup07-20-2023.sql\"), i.e. can easily be guessed. This file can be accessed by any unauthenticated actor and contains a dump of the whole database including password hashes.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/os4ed/opensis-responsive-design","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0d3e2d52912540d4edf87d5b8c005cd6b32ff313"}]}],"versions":["V7.5","V7.6","V8.0","V9.0","Ver7.0Prod","Ver7.0Prod_update","Ver7.0beta1","v7.1","v7.2","v7.3","ver7.1","ver7.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-38880.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/dub-flow/vulnerability-research/tree/main/CVE-2023-38880"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/OS4ED/openSIS-Classic"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.os4ed.com/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
