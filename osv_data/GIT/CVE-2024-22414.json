Improper storage and rendering of the `/user/<user>` page allows a user's comments to execute arbitrary javascript code. The html template `user.html` contains the following code snippet to render comments made by a user: `<div class=\"content\" tag=\"content\">{{comment[2]|safe}}</div>`. Use of the \"safe\" tag causes flask to _not_ escape the rendered content. To remediate this, simply remove the `|safe` tag from the HTML above. No fix is is available and users are advised to manually edit their installation.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dogukanurker/flaskblog","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"571a251045877de6f537a259f1937f4a7ca873a4"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","1.0.9","1.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-22414.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DogukanUrker/flaskBlog/security/advisories/GHSA-mrcw-j96f-p6v6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
