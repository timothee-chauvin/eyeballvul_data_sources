{
  "id": "CVE-2020-26268",
  "details": "In affected versions of TensorFlow the tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst operation returns a constant tensor created from a memory mapped file which is assumed immutable. However, if the type of the tensor is not an integral type, the operation crashes the Python interpreter as it tries to write to the memory area. If the file is too small, TensorFlow properly returns an error as the memory area has fewer bytes than what is needed for the tensor it creates. However, as soon as there are enough bytes, the above snippet causes a segmentation fault. This is because the allocator used to return the buffer data is not marked as returning an opaque handle since the needed virtual method is not overridden. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.",
