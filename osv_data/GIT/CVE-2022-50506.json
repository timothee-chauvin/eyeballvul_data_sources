{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-50506","published":"2025-10-04T15:43:54.955Z","modified":"2025-11-19T19:59:38.491249Z","summary":"drbd: only clone bio if we have a backing device","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrbd: only clone bio if we have a backing device\n\nCommit c347a787e34cb (drbd: set ->bi_bdev in drbd_req_new) moved a\nbio_set_dev call (which has since been removed) to \"earlier\", from\ndrbd_request_prepare to drbd_req_new.\n\nThe problem is that this accesses device->ldev->backing_bdev, which is\nnot NULL-checked at this point. When we don't have an ldev (i.e. when\nthe DRBD device is diskless), this leads to a null pointer deref.\n\nSo, only allocate the private_bio if we actually have a disk. This is\nalso a small optimization, since we don't clone the bio to only to\nimmediately free it again in the diskless case.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"c347a787e34cba0e5a80a04082dacaf259105605"},{"fixed":"05580a3bbf3cec677cb00a85dfeb21d6a9b48eaf"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"c347a787e34cba0e5a80a04082dacaf259105605"},{"fixed":"6d42ddf7f27b6723549ee6d4c8b1b418b59bf6b5"}]}],"versions":["v5.17","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50506.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50506.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/05580a3bbf3cec677cb00a85dfeb21d6a9b48eaf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6d42ddf7f27b6723549ee6d4c8b1b418b59bf6b5"}]}
