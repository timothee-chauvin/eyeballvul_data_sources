Versions prior to 1.1.3 are subject to an arbitrary file read vulnerability. The attacker must have access to the target host or trick an administrator into executing a malicious gh-ost command on a host running gh-ost, plus network access from host running gh-ost to the attack's malicious MySQL server. The `-database` parameter does not properly sanitize user input which can lead to arbitrary file reads.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/github/gh-ost","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a91ab042de013cfd8fbb633763438932d9080d8f"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-21687.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/github/gh-ost/commit/a91ab042de013cfd8fbb633763438932d9080d8f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/github/gh-ost/security/advisories/GHSA-rrp4-2xx3-mv29"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
