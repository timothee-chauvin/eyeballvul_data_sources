GeoTools Schema class use of Eclipse XSD library to represent schema data structure is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) exploit. This impacts whoever exposes XML processing with gt-xsd-core involved in parsing, when the documents carry a reference to an external XML schema. The gt-xsd-core Schemas class is not using the EntityResolver provided by the ParserHandler (if any was configured). This also impacts users of gt-wfs-ng DataStore where the ENTITY_RESOLVER connection parameter was not being used as intended. This vulnerability is fixed in GeoTools 33.1, 32.3, 31.7, and 28.6.1, GeoServer 2.27.1, 2.26.3, and 2.25.7, and GeoNetwork 4.4.8 and 4.2.13.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork","events":[{"introduced":"bdc0a9c92ef52718f7582bfa87149d1b93e02c0b"},{"fixed":"42984e723d2c8e7b62e85915c730a617d5041ad1"}]}],"versions":["4.2.0","4.2.1","4.2.10","4.2.11","4.2.2","4.2.3","4.2.4","4.2.5","4.2.6","4.2.7","4.2.8","4.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-30220.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"035172d66d5225f758d789b0863bd46b2f7c15e8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-30220.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/geotools/geotools","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4f5e91f481b5779b63e3bcecb3bf25389bca0ca9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-30220.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/security/advisories/GHSA-2p76-gc46-5fvc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-jj54-8f66-c5pc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/geotools/geotools/security/advisories/GHSA-826p-4gcg-35vw"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/pull/8757"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/pull/8803"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/pull/8812"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/production/config.html#production-config-external-entities"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-611","CWE-918"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L"}]}
