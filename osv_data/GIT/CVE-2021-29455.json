Grassroot Platform before master deployment as of 2021-04-16 did not properly verify the signature of JSON Web Tokens when refreshing an existing JWT. This allows to forge a valid JWT. The problem has been patched in version 1.3.1 by deprecating the JWT refresh function, which was an overdue deprecation regardless (the \"refresh\" flow is no longer used).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/grassrootza/grassroot-platform","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a2e6e885f8183a066d938cf909fd813a7af7d67f"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-29455.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/grassrootza/grassroot-platform/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/grassrootza/grassroot-platform/commit/a2e6e885f8183a066d938cf909fd813a7af7d67f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/grassrootza/grassroot-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-f65w-6xw8-6734"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
