Based on Notary Project specifications. The issue was identified during Quarkslab's security audit on the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) based revocation check feature.\nAfter retrieving the CRL, notation-go attempts to update the CRL cache using the os.Rename method. However, this operation may fail due to operating system-specific limitations, particularly when the source and destination paths are on different mount points. This failure could lead to an unexpected program termination. In method `crl.(*FileCache).Set`, a temporary file is created in the OS dedicated area (like /tmp for, usually, Linux/Unix). The file is written and then it is tried to move it to the dedicated `notation` cache directory thanks `os.Rename`. As specified in Go documentation, OS specific restriction may apply. When used with Linux OS, it is relying on rename syscall from the libc and as per the documentation, moving a file to a different mountpoint raises an EXDEV error, interpreted as Cross device link not permitted error. Some Linux distribution, like RedHat use a dedicated filesystem (tmpfs), mounted on a specific mountpoint (usually /tmp) for temporary files. When using such OS, revocation check based on CRL will repeatedly crash notation. As a result the signature verification process is aborted as process crashes. This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3c3302258ad510fbca2f8a73731569d91f07d196"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0-alpha.3","v0.11.0-alpha.4","v0.12.0-beta.1","v0.7.0-alpha.1","v0.8.0-alpha.1","v0.9.0-alpha.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc.1","v1.0.0-rc.2","v1.0.0-rc.3","v1.0.0-rc.4","v1.0.0-rc.5","v1.0.0-rc.6","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.2.0-beta.1","v1.3.0-rc.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-51491.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/commit/3c3302258ad510fbca2f8a73731569d91f07d196"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/security/advisories/GHSA-qjh3-4j3h-vmwp"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/rename.2.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-703"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
