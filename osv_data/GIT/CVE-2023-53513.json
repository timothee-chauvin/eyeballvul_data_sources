of ioctl arg","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnbd: fix incomplete validation of ioctl arg\n\nWe tested and found an alarm caused by nbd_ioctl arg without verification.\nThe UBSAN warning calltrace like below:\n\nUBSAN: Undefined behaviour in fs/buffer.c:1709:35\nsigned integer overflow:\n-9223372036854775808 - 1 cannot be represented in type

is __block_write_full_page()\n-> i_size_read(inode) - 1 overflow.\ninode->i_size is assigned in __nbd_ioctl() -> nbd_set_size() -> bytesize.\nWe think it is necessary to limit the size of arg to prevent errors.\n\nMoreover, __nbd_ioctl() -> nbd_add_socket(), arg will be cast to int.\nAssuming the value of arg is 0x80000000000000001) (on a 64-bit machine),\nit will become 1 after the coercion, which will return unexpected results.\n\nFix it by adding checks to prevent passing in too large
