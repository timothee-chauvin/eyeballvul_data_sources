move dpu_encoder's connector assignment to atomic_enable()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/dpu: move dpu_encoder's connector assignment to atomic_enable()\n\nFor cases where the crtc's connectors_changed was set without enable/active\ngetting toggled , there is an atomic_enable() call followed by an\natomic_disable() but without an atomic_mode_set().\n\nThis results in a NULL ptr access for the dpu_encoder_get_drm_fmt() call in\nthe atomic_enable() as the dpu_encoder's connector was cleared in the\natomic_disable() but not re-assigned as there was no atomic_mode_set() call.\n\nFix the NULL ptr access by moving the assignment for atomic_enable() and also\nuse drm_atomic_get_new_connector_for_encoder() to get the connector from\nthe atomic_state.\n\nPatchwork:
