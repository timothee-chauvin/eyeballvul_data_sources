As a result, the system tries to lock the mutex whole holding\nthe spinlock.\n\nIt seems, the internal regmap locks are not needed in this driver at all.\nmcp->lock seems to protect the regmap from concurrent accesses already,\nexcept, probably, in mcp_pinconf_get/set.\n\nmcp23s08_irq_set_type() and mcp23s08_irq_mask/unmask() are called under\nchip_bus_lock(), which calls mcp23s08_irq_bus_lock(). The latter takes\nmcp->lock and enables regmap caching, so that the potentially slow I2C\naccesses are deferred until chip_bus_unlock().\n\nThe accesses to the regmap from mcp23s08_probe_one() do not need additional\nlocking.\n\nIn all remaining places where the regmap is accessed, except\nmcp_pinconf_get/set(), the driver already takes mcp->lock.\n\nThis patch adds locking in mcp_pinconf_get/set() and disables internal\nlocking in the regmap config. Among other things, it fixes the sleeping\nin atomic context described
