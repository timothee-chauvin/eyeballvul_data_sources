{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-54886","published":"2025-08-08T00:03:45Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:39:52.423110Z","aliases":["GHSA-378x-6p4f-8jgm"],"summary":"skops: Card.get_model does not block arbitrary code execution","details":"skops is a Python library which helps users share and ship their scikit-learn based models. In versions 0.12.0 and below, the Card.get_model does not contain any logic to prevent arbitrary code execution. The Card.get_model function supports both joblib and skops for model loading. When loading .skops models, it uses skops' secure loading with trusted type validation, raising errors for untrusted types unless explicitly allowed. However, when non-.zip file formats are provided, the function silently falls back to joblib without warning. Unlike skops, joblib allows arbitrary code execution during loading, bypassing security measures and potentially enabling malicious code execution. This issue is fixed in version 0.13.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/skops-dev/skops","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"579923f75e4b079e0b4f3b1d8c5a9ffcecf4a2e8"}]}],"versions":["v0.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54886.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/skops-dev/skops/commit/29d61ea8a92f2bde6830e8f32cc72a1a87211cda"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/skops-dev/skops/security/advisories/GHSA-378x-6p4f-8jgm"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
