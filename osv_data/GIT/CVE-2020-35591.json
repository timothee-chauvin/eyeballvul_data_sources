The application does not generate a new session cookie after the user is logged in. A malicious user is able to create a new session cookie value and inject it to a victim. After the victim logs in, the injected cookie becomes valid, giving the attacker access to the user's account through the active session.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pi-hole/adminlte","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"a03d1bddf74f0164f637126b06705bb659dfa4e7"},{"last_affected":"b86e4a3178e46cef9fc738c6a0fb8d0ef0ff2fbc"},{"last_affected":"d8d3f316061ba60e0b1dfc6a11f6e917380aca5f"}]}],"versions":["0.1","1.0","1.1","1.2","1.2.1","1.3","2.0.0","2.1.0","2.1.1","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.2","v1.3","v1.4","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.3.1","v1.4.3.1a","v1.4.4","v1.4.4.1","v1.4.4.2","v2.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.1","v2.1.0-alpha-1","v2.1.0-beta","v2.1.2","v2.2","v2.2.0","v2.3","v2.3.1","v2.4","v2.5","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v3.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.1a","v3.1","v3.2","v3.2.1","v3.3","v4.0","v4.1","v4.1.1","v4.2","v4.3","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v5.0","v5.1","v5.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-35591.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"4d25f695267590b61a4061f9bb43448005d99b85"},{"last_affected":"56cd7c4d59ceb629a2170cd1c8ab78ef26366019"},{"last_affected":"e9b039139c468798fb6d9457e4c9012171faee33"}]}],"versions":["2.0","2.8","V2.5.1","V2.9.1","V2.9.2","v2.1","v2.10","v2.10.1","v2.10.2","v2.11","v2.11.1","v2.11.2","v2.12","v2.12.1","v2.13","v2.13.1","v2.13.2","v2.2","v2.3","v2.4","v2.5","v2.5.2","v2.5.3","v2.6","v2.6.1","v2.6.1.1","v2.6.1.2","v2.6.2","v2.6.3","v2.7","v2.7.1","v2.8.1","v2.9","v2.9.3","v2.9.4","v2.9.4a","v2.9.5","v3.0","v3.0.1","v3.1","v3.1.4","v3.2","v3.2.1","v3.3","v3.3.1","v4.0","v4.1","v4.1.1","v4.2","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.3","v4.3.1","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v4.3.4","v4.3.5","v4.4","v5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-35591.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://discourse.pi-hole.net/c/announcements/5"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://n4nj0.github.io/advisories/pi-hole-multiple-vulnerabilities-i/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
