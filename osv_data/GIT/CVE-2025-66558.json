Prior to 1.4.2 and 2.4.1, a missing ownership check allowed an attack to take-away a 2FA webauthn device when correctly guessing a 80-128 character long random string of letters, numbers and symbols. The victim would then be prompted to register a new device on the next login. The attacker can not authenticate as the victim. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.2 and 2.4.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/twofactor_webauthn","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7da9d0691cb0392ceabcc967a7c9fc7151f1e43a"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/twofactor_webauthn","events":[{"introduced":"92487d5cf1425c006795713e21adc81c6d1e0dc3"},{"fixed":"72be9ebf76478e59724580ca4336fc517202e0e1"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.0.0-beta.1"},{"fixed":"2.4.1"}]}}],"versions":["v0.3.1","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.0-rc.1","v1.4.1","v2.0.0-beta.1","v2.1.0-beta.1","v2.3.0","v2.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66558.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66558.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-fr8x-mvjg-wf9q"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/twofactor_webauthn/commit/5d2302166d31ee2e01b2e21556bd5372156da13d"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/twofactor_webauthn/pull/881"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/3360354"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66558"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-639"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66558.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
