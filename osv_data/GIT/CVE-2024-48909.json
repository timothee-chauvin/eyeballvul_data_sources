Starting in version 1.35.0 and prior to version 1.37.1, clients that have enabled `LookupResources2` and have caveats in the evaluation path for their requests can return a permissionship of `CONDITIONAL` with context marked as missing, even then the context was supplied. LookupResources2 is the new default in SpiceDB 1.37.0 and has been opt-in since SpiceDB 1.35.0. The bug is patched as part of SpiceDB 1.37.1. As a workaround, disable LookupResources2 via the `--enable-experimental-lookup-resources` flag by setting it to `false`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb","events":[{"introduced":"62be65d833178adfe409b55556860e3de77684e0"},{"fixed":"43afc28f5aaba86c4b2b13004857cfe209d444da"}]}],"versions":["v1.35.0","v1.35.1","v1.35.2","v1.35.3","v1.37.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-48909.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/48xxx/CVE-2024-48909.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/2f3cf77a7fcfcb478ef5a480a245842c96ac8853"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-3c32-4hq9-6wgj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-48909"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-172"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/48xxx/CVE-2024-48909.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
