{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53376","published":"2025-09-18T13:33:22.364Z","modified":"2025-12-05T03:09:16.147025Z","summary":"scsi: mpi3mr: Use number of bits to manage bitmap sizes","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: mpi3mr: Use number of bits to manage bitmap sizes\n\nTo allocate bitmaps, the mpi3mr driver calculates sizes of bitmaps using\nbyte as unit. However, bitmap helper functions assume that bitmaps are\nallocated using unsigned long as unit. This gap causes memory access beyond\nthe bitmap sizes and results in \"BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds\".  The BUG\nwas observed at firmware download to eHBA-9600. Call trace indicated that\nthe out-of-bounds access happened in find_first_zero_bit() called from\nmpi3mr_send_event_ack() for miroc->evtack_cmds_bitmap.\n\nTo fix the BUG, do not use bytes to manage bitmap sizes. Instead, use\nnumber of bits, and call bitmap helper functions which take number of bits\nas arguments. For memory allocation, call bitmap_zalloc() instead of\nkzalloc() and krealloc(). For memory free, call bitmap_free() instead of\nkfree(). For zero clear, call bitmap_clear() instead of memset().\n\nRemove three fields for bitmap byte sizes in struct scmd_priv which are no\nlonger required. Replace the field dev_handle_bitmap_sz with\ndev_handle_bitmap_bits to keep number of bits of removepend_bitmap across\nresize.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"824a156633dfdb0e17979a0d0bb2c757d1bb949c"},{"fixed":"6a675a6d57d31da43d8da576465c1cd5d5b0bd3d"},{"fixed":"8ac713d2e9845e9234bb12ae5903040685d5aff9"},{"fixed":"339e61565f81a6534afdc18fd854b2e2628bf5db"}]}],"versions":["v5.13","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53376.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.14.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.18"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53376.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/339e61565f81a6534afdc18fd854b2e2628bf5db"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6a675a6d57d31da43d8da576465c1cd5d5b0bd3d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8ac713d2e9845e9234bb12ae5903040685d5aff9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53376.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53376"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53376.json"}}
