By sending a specially crafted host header in the reset password request, it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked, lead to an attacker-controlled server and thus leak the password reset token. This allows an attacker to reset other users' passwords.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gugoan/economizzer","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"bc406f9afbcbdfa15c7d55db0ee3b0c017abcb2b"}]}],"versions":["v0.4-alpha","v0.8-alpha","v0.9-beta1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-38877.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/gugoan/economizzer/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.economizzer.org"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/dub-flow/vulnerability-research/tree/main/CVE-2023-38877"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
