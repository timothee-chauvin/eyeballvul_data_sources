cow roots list","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix race when deleting free space root from the dirty cow roots list\n\nWhen deleting the free space tree we are deleting the free space root\nfrom the list fs_info->dirty_cowonly_roots without taking the lock that\nprotects it, which is struct btrfs_fs_info::trans_lock.\nThis unsynchronized list manipulation may cause chaos if there's another\nconcurrent manipulation of this list, such as when adding a root to it\nwith ctree.c:add_root_to_dirty_list().\n\nThis can result in all sorts of weird failures caused by a race, such as\nthe following crash:\n\n  [337571.278245] general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000108: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\n
