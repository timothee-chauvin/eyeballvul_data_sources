However, that\nfunction does not wait until the work function finishes. This\nmeans that the callback function may still be running after\nthe driver's remove function has finished, which would result\nin a use-after-free.\n\nFix by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync(), which ensures that\nthe work is properly cancelled, no longer running, and unable\nto re-schedule itself.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"b60ee210a76cabdc2dd5396de299a1860b4945cd"},{"fixed":"b85102a3aa3810a09eb55692e8cd6ffbb304e57d"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"89cdb224f2abe37ec4ac21ba0d9ddeb5a6a9cf68"},{"fixed":"390a1a98288a53b2e7555097d83c6e55d579b166"},{"fixed":"1b41beaa7a58467505ec3023af8aad74f878b888"}]}],"versions":["v6.0.11","v6.0.12","v6.0.13","v6.0.14","v6.0.15","v6.1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50305.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.16"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.1.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50305.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1b41beaa7a58467505ec3023af8aad74f878b888"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/390a1a98288a53b2e7555097d83c6e55d579b166"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b85102a3aa3810a09eb55692e8cd6ffbb304e57d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50305.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50305"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50305.json"}}
