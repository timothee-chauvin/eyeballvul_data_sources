An attacker can remotely exploit this vulnerability without authentication by providing specially crafted input that causes the application to consume an excessive amount of CPU resources. This vulnerability affects the latest version of kubeflow/kubeflow, specifically within the centraldashboard-angular backend component. The impact of exploiting this vulnerability includes resource exhaustion, and service disruption.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"48b8643bee14b8c85c3de9f6d129752bb55b44d3"}]}],"versions":["4e7f4ed","v0","v0.1.0-rc.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0-rc.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.1-rc.1","v0.4.0-rc.1","v0.6.0-rc.0","v0.6.start","v0.7.0-rc.0","v0.7.0-rc.1","v0.7.0-rc.2","v0.7.0-rc.3","v0.7.0-rc.4","v0.7.0-rc.5","v1.1.0","v1.2-rc.0","v1.5.0-rc.0","v1.9.0-rc.0","v1.9.0-rc.1","v1.9.0-rc.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-5552.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/0c1d6432-f385-4c54-beea-9f8c677def5b"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
