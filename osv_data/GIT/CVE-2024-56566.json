Because the slab is neither on the partial list nor\non the full list, it eventually lead to a list corruption (actually a\nlist poison being detected).\n\nSo we need to mark and isolate the slab page with metadata corruption,\ndo not put it back in circulation.\n\nBecause the debug caches avoid all the fastpaths, reusing the frozen bit\nto mark slab page with metadata corruption seems to be fine.\n\n[ 4277.385669] list_del corruption, ffffea00044b3e50->next is LIST_POISON1 (dead000000000100)\n[ 4277.387023] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[ 4277.387880] kernel BUG at
