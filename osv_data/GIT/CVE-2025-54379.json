In versions before 2.2.1, there is a critical SQL Injection vulnerability in the getLast API functionality of the eKuiper project. This flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the underlying SQLite database by manipulating the table name input in an API request. Exploitation can lead to data theft, corruption, or deletion, and full database compromise. This is fixed in version 2.2.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lf-edge/ekuiper","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"190113a2e4991a9dd4d6b9e0fb6b0ef973d3f472"}]}],"versions":["0.0.2","0.0.3","0.0.4","0.1","0.1.1","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.9.0","0.9.1","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.10.0","1.10.0-alpha.0","1.10.0-alpha.1","1.10.0-beta.0","1.11.0","1.11.0-alpha.0","1.11.0-alpha.1","1.11.0-alpha.2","1.11.0-beta.0","1.11.0-beta.1","1.11.1","1.12.0","1.12.0-alpha.1","1.12.0-alpha.2","1.12.0-alpha.3","1.12.0-alpha.4","1.12.0-beta.1","1.12.0-beta.2","1.12.0-beta.3","1.12.0-beta.4","1.12.0-beta.5","1.12.0-beta.6","1.12.1","1.13.0","1.13.0-alpha.1","1.13.0-alpha.2","1.13.0-beta.1","1.13.0-beta.2","1.13.0-beta.3","1.13.0-beta.4","1.13.0-beta.5","1.13.0-beta.6","1.14.0-alpha.1","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.3.0","1.3.0-beta.0","1.3.1","1.4.0","1.4.0-beta.0","1.4.0-beta.1","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.7.0","1.7.1","1.8.0","1.8.0-alpha.1","1.8.0-alpha.2","1.8.0-alpha.3","1.8.0-beta.0","1.8.0-beta.1","1.8.1","1.9.0","1.9.0-alpha.0","1.9.0-alpha.1","1.9.0-beta.0","contract/v2.0.0","contract/v2.0.0-alpha.1","contract/v2.0.0-alpha.2","contract/v2.0.0-alpha.3","contract/v2.0.0-alpha.4","contract/v2.0.0-alpha.5","contract/v2.0.0-beta.1","v1.14.0-alpha.1","v1.14.0-alpha.2","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha.10","v2.0.0-alpha.11","v2.0.0-alpha.2","v2.0.0-alpha.3","v2.0.0-alpha.4","v2.0.0-alpha.5","v2.0.0-alpha.6","v2.0.0-alpha.7","v2.0.0-alpha.8","v2.0.0-alpha.9","v2.0.0-beta.1","v2.0.0-beta.2","v2.0.0-beta.3","v2.0.0-beta.4","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-alpha.1","v2.1.0-alpha.2","v2.1.0-beta.1","v2.1.0-beta.2","v2.1.0-beta.3","v2.1.0-beta.4","v2.2.0","v2.2.0-alpha.1","v2.2.0-alpha.2","v2.2.0-alpha.3","v2.2.0-alpha.4","v2.2.0-alpha.5","v2.2.0-beta.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54379.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54379.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lf-edge/ekuiper/commit/72c4918744934deebf04e324ae66933ec089ebd3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/lf-edge/ekuiper/security/advisories/GHSA-526j-mv3p-f4vv"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54379"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-89"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54379.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
