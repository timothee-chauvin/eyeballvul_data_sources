Due to a URL parsing issue, Requests releases prior to 2.32.4 may leak .netrc credentials to third parties for specific maliciously-crafted URLs. Users should upgrade to version 2.32.4 to receive a fix. For older versions of Requests, use of the .netrc file can be disabled with `trust_env=False` on one's Requests Session.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/psf/requests","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"021dc729f0b71a3030cefdbec7fb57a0e80a6cfd"}]}],"versions":["2.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.10.3","v0.10.4","v0.10.5","v0.10.6","v0.10.7","v0.10.8","v0.11.1","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.13.3","v0.13.4","v0.13.5","v0.13.6","v0.13.7","v0.13.9","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v0.6.6","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.5","v0.7.6","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.8.5","v0.8.6","v0.8.7","v0.8.8","v0.8.9","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.3","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v2.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.11.1","v2.12.0","v2.12.1","v2.12.2","v2.12.3","v2.12.4","v2.12.5","v2.13.0","v2.14.0","v2.14.1","v2.14.2","v2.15.0","v2.15.1","v2.16.0","v2.16.1","v2.16.2","v2.16.3","v2.16.4","v2.16.5","v2.17.0","v2.17.1","v2.17.3","v2.18.0","v2.18.1","v2.18.2","v2.18.3","v2.18.4","v2.19.0","v2.19.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.20.0","v2.20.1","v2.21.0","v2.22.0","v2.24.0","v2.25.0","v2.25.1","v2.26.0","v2.27.0","v2.27.1","v2.28.0","v2.28.1","v2.28.2","v2.29.0","v2.3.0","v2.30.0","v2.31.0","v2.32.0","v2.32.1","v2.32.2","v2.32.3","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v2.5.3","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v2.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47081.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2025/Jun/2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/03/11"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/03/9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/04/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/04/6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/47xxx/CVE-2024-47081.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/psf/requests/commit/96ba401c1296ab1dda74a2365ef36d88f7d144ef"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6965"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9hjg-9r4m-mvj7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47081"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.Session.trust_env"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2025/Jun/2"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-522"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/47xxx/CVE-2024-47081.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
