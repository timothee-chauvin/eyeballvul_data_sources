Prior to versions 1.13.13, 1.14.8, and 1.15.2, in Cilium clusters with IPsec enabled and traffic matching Layer 7 policies, IPsec-eligible traffic between a node's Envoy proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted and IPsec-eligible traffic between a node's DNS proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted. This issue has been resolved in Cilium 1.15.2, 1.14.8, and 1.13.13. There is no known workaround for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ca1af73ffe025e2ebdb6c8cd5b2cfb1909cb3b06"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium","events":[{"introduced":"b5013e1562dbfe442dd2011a5af46de9095315ff"},{"fixed":"cf6e022edbedc39c35237330ab85c158ff17f207"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium","events":[{"introduced":"2db45c468981a863b230186ad37d44e5a7c08d61"},{"fixed":"7cf5782920423b07e7a4e6e67fafd81e1d4a1d33"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-rc0","1.11.0-rc0","1.11.0-rc1","1.11.0-rc2","1.12.0-rc0","1.12.0-rc1","1.12.0-rc2","1.13.0","1.13.0-rc0","1.13.0-rc1","1.13.0-rc2","1.13.0-rc3","1.13.0-rc4","1.13.0-rc5","1.13.1","1.13.10","1.13.11","1.13.12","1.13.2","1.13.3","1.13.4","1.13.5","1.13.6","1.13.7","1.13.8","1.13.9","1.14.0","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.14.5","1.14.6","1.14.7","1.15.0","1.15.1","1.5.0-rc2","1.8.0-rc1","1.9.0-rc0","1.9.0-rc1","v0.10.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.10","v0.13.14","v0.13.15","v0.13.16","v0.13.17","v0.13.18","v0.13.19","v0.13.2","v0.13.20","v0.13.21","v0.13.22","v0.13.25","v0.13.4","v0.13.5","v0.13.6","v0.13.8","v0.8.0","v0.8.2","v0.9.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc4","v1.0.0-rc5","v1.0.0-rc6","v1.0.0-rc7","v1.0.0-rc8","v1.0.0-rc9","v1.10.0-rc0","v1.11.0-rc0","v1.11.0-rc1","v1.11.0-rc2","v1.12.0-rc0","v1.12.0-rc1","v1.12.0-rc2","v1.13.0","v1.13.0-rc0","v1.13.0-rc1","v1.13.0-rc2","v1.13.0-rc3","v1.13.0-rc4","v1.13.0-rc5","v1.13.1","v1.13.10","v1.13.11","v1.13.12","v1.13.2","v1.13.3","v1.13.4","v1.13.5","v1.13.6","v1.13.7","v1.13.8","v1.13.9","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.14.2","v1.14.3","v1.14.4","v1.14.5","v1.14.6","v1.14.7","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.5.0-rc1","v1.5.0-rc2","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.6.0-rc2","v1.6.0-rc3","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.7.0-rc2","v1.8.0-rc1","v1.9.0-rc0","v1.9.0-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-28249.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-j89h-qrvr-xc36"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.13.13"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.14.8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.15.2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-311"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
