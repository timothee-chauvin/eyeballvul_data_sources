Such flow is inaccurate\nas the lag driver is not responsible for loading/unloading ethernet\nrepresentors. Furthermore, the flow described above begins by holding\nlag lock to prevent bond changes during disable flow. However, when\nreaching the ethernet representors detachment from lag, the lag lock is\nrequired again, triggering the following deadlock:\n\nCall
