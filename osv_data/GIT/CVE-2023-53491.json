This was fixed in\ngcc-11. Now that the function attribute is available, let's start using\nit.\n\nCallers of boot_init_stack_canary need to use this function attribute\nunless they're compiled with -fno-stack-protector, otherwise the canary\nstored in the stack slot of the caller will differ upon the call to\nboot_init_stack_canary.
