{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-53533","published":"2025-10-27T19:06:32Z","modified":"2025-10-28T02:58:06.560866Z","aliases":["GHSA-w8f8-92rx-4f6w"],"summary":"Pi-hole Admin Interface vulnerable to cross-site scripting via malformed URL path on 404 error page","details":"Pi-hole Admin Interface is a web interface for managing Pi-hole, a network-level advertisement and internet tracker blocking application. Pi-hole Admin Interface versions 6.2.1 and earlier are vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) via a malformed URL path. The 404 error page includes the requested path in the class attribute of the body tag without proper sanitization or escaping. An attacker can craft a URL containing an onload attribute that will execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser when a victim visits the malicious link. If an attacker sends a crafted pi-hole link to a victim and the victim visits it, attacker-controlled JavaScript code is executed in the browser of the victim. This has been patched in version 6.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pi-hole/web","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"62c55dcf358663e39c2ab629238ac34609562ae9"}]}],"versions":["0.1","1.0","1.1","1.2","1.2.1","1.3","2.0.0","2.1.0","2.1.1","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.2","v1.3","v1.4","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.3.1","v1.4.3.1a","v1.4.4","v1.4.4.1","v1.4.4.2","v2.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.1","v2.1.0-alpha-1","v2.1.0-beta","v2.1.2","v2.2","v2.2.0","v2.3","v2.3.1","v2.4","v2.5","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v3.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.1a","v3.1","v3.2","v3.2.1","v3.3","v4.0","v4.1","v4.1.1","v4.2","v4.3","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v5.0","v5.1","v5.1.1","v5.10","v5.10.1","v5.11","v5.12","v5.13","v5.14","v5.14.1","v5.14.2","v5.15","v5.15.1","v5.16","v5.17","v5.18","v5.18.1","v5.18.2","v5.18.3","v5.18.4","v5.19","v5.2","v5.2.1","v5.2.2","v5.20","v5.20.1","v5.20.2","v5.21","v5.3","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.4","v5.5","v5.5.1","v5.6","v5.7","v5.8","v5.9","v6.0","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.1","v6.2","v6.2.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53533.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pi-hole/web/security/advisories/GHSA-w8f8-92rx-4f6w"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
