Before moving to pulling translations from the openedx-translations repository via openedx-atlas, translations in the edx-platform repository were validated using edx-i18n-tools. This validation included protection against malformed translations and translations-based script injections. Prior to this patch, the validation implemented in the openedx-translations repository did not include the same protections. The maintainer inspected the translations in the edx-platform directory of both the main and open-release/redwood.master branches of the openedx-translations repository and found no evidence of exploited translation strings.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3c4093705dec99590577c4d8270ce263f7fffc5a"},{"fixed":"b2444340e8702c7955310331c1db5fd85b25b92b"}]}],"versions":["open-release/redwood.1","open-release/redwood.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-43782.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/security/advisories/GHSA-fg8c-2pvj-wx3j"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/commit/3c4093705dec99590577c4d8270ce263f7fffc5a"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/commit/b2444340e8702c7955310331c1db5fd85b25b92b"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-74"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
