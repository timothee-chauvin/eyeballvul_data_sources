Prior to 1.5.3 and 1.6.1, due to the peer verification logic in virt-handler (via verifyPeerCert), an attacker who compromises a virt-handler instance, could exploit these shared credentials to impersonate virt-api and execute privileged operations against other virt-handler instances potentially compromising the integrity and availability of the VM managed by it. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.3 and 1.6.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4f27e414aa0e7c805b04911902b888bc9c3b2f82"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt","events":[{"introduced":"9a683cafb00c2f919e3fc8e259df1030893a4b13"},{"fixed":"00d03e43e3bf03e563136695a4732b65ed42d764"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.6.0-alpha.0"},{"fixed":"1.6.1"}]}}],"versions":["v0.0.1-alpha.0","v0.0.1-alpha.1","v0.0.1-alpha.2","v0.0.1-alpha.3","v0.0.1-alpha.4","v0.0.1-alpha.5","v0.0.1-alpha.6","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.1.0","v0.1.0-alpha","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.12.0","v0.12.0-alpha.0","v0.12.0-alpha.1","v0.12.0-alpha.2","v0.12.0-alpha.3","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.15.0","v0.15.0-alpha.0","v0.16.0","v0.16.0-alpha.0","v0.17.0","v0.17.0-alpha.0","v0.17.0-alpha.1","v0.18.0","v0.19.0","v0.19.0-rc.0","v0.2.0","v0.20.0","v0.21.0","v0.22.0","v0.23.0","v0.24.0","v0.25.0","v0.25.0-rc.0","v0.26.0","v0.26.0-rc.0","v0.26.1","v0.27.0","v0.27.0-rc.0","v0.28.0","v0.28.0-rc.0","v0.28.0-rc.1","v0.28.0-rc.2","v0.29.0","v0.29.0-rc.0","v0.29.0-rc.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.0-alpha.0","v0.3.0-alpha.1","v0.3.0-alpha.2","v0.3.0-alpha.3","v0.3.0-alpha.4","v0.30.0","v0.30.0-rc.0","v0.30.0-rc.1","v0.30.0-rc.2","v0.30.0-rc.3","v0.30.0-rc.4","v0.31.0","v0.31.0-rc.1","v0.32.0-rc.1","v0.33.0-rc.0","v0.34.0-rc.0","v0.35.0","v0.35.0-rc.0","v0.36.0-rc.0","v0.37.0-rc.0","v0.38.0","v0.38.0-rc.0","v0.39.0-rc.0","v0.4.0","v0.4.0-alpha.0","v0.4.0-alpha.1","v0.4.0-alpha.2","v0.4.1","v0.4.1-alpha.1","v0.4.1-alpha.2","v0.40.0-rc.0","v0.41.0-rc.0","v0.42.0","v0.42.0-rc.0","v0.43.0-rc.0","v0.43.1-rc.1","v0.44.0","v0.44.0-rc.0","v0.45.0","v0.45.0-rc.0","v0.46.0","v0.46.0-rc.0","v0.47.0-rc.0","v0.48.0","v0.48.0-rc.0","v0.49.0","v0.49.0-rc.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.0-alpha.0","v0.5.0-alpha.1","v0.5.1-alpha.1","v0.5.1-alpha.2","v0.5.1-alpha.3","v0.50.0","v0.50.0-rc.0","v0.51.0","v0.51.0-rc.0","v0.52.0","v0.52.0-rc.0","v0.53.0","v0.53.0-rc.0","v0.54.0","v0.54.0-rc.0","v0.55.0","v0.55.0-rc.0","v0.56.0-rc.0","v0.57.0","v0.57.0-rc.0","v0.58.0","v0.58.0-rc.0","v0.59.0-alpha.0","v0.59.0-alpha.1","v0.59.0-alpha.2","v0.59.0-rc.0","v0.59.0-rc.1","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.1-alpha.0","v0.60.0-alpha.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.0-alpha.0","v0.7.0-alpha.1","v0.7.0-alpha.2","v0.7.0-alpha.3","v0.7.0-alpha.4","v0.7.0-alpha.5","v0.8.0","v0.8.0-alpha.0","v0.8.0-alpha.1","v0.8.0-alpha.2","v0.9.0","v0.9.0-alpha.0","v0.9.0-alpha.1","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v1.0.0-alpha.0","v1.0.0-beta.0","v1.1.0-alpha.0","v1.1.0-rc.0","v1.2.0-alpha.0","v1.2.0-beta.0","v1.2.0-rc.0","v1.3.0-alpha.0","v1.3.0-beta.0","v1.4.0-alpha.0","v1.4.0-alpha.1","v1.4.0-rc.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-alpha.0","v1.5.0-beta.0","v1.5.0-rc.0","v1.5.0-rc.1","v1.5.0-rc.2","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-alpha.0","v1.6.0-beta.0","v1.6.0-rc.0","v1.6.0-rc.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64434.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/commit/231dc69723f331dc02f65a31ab4c3d6869f40d6a"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/commit/af2f08a9a186eccc650f87c30ab3e07b669e8b5b"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/commit/b9773bc588e6e18ece896a2dad5336ef7a653074"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/security/advisories/GHSA-ggp9-c99x-54gp"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
