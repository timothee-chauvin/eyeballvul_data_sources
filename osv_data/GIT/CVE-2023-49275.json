{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-49275","published":"2024-04-19T14:24:25.343Z","modified":"2025-12-05T00:16:18.541361Z","aliases":["GHSA-4mq7-w9r6-9975"],"summary":"Wazuh vulnerable to  NULL Pointer Dereference in wazuh-analysisd","details":"Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. A NULL pointer dereference was detected during fuzzing of the analysis engine, allowing malicious clients to DoS the analysis engine. The bug occurs when `analysisd` receives a syscollector message with the `hotfix` `msg_type` but lacking a `timestamp`. It uses `cJSON_GetObjectItem()` to get the `timestamp` object item and dereferences it without checking for a `NULL` value. A malicious client can DoS the analysis engine. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.7.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh","events":[{"introduced":"1dfef3696c85a19283be96b2c60218888a130a1c"},{"fixed":"5a0abd9df1faa5f4b93848cebed90c39f76d6c64"}]}],"versions":["v3.10.0","v3.10.1","v3.10.2","v3.11.0","v3.11.1","v3.11.2","v3.11.3","v3.11.4","v3.12.0","v3.12.1","v3.12.2","v3.12.3","v3.13.0","v3.13.1","v3.13.2","v3.13.3","v3.13.4","v3.13.5","v3.13.6","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.2.3","v3.2.4","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.4.0","v3.5.0","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.7.2","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.8.2","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v3.9.2","v3.9.3","v3.9.4","v3.9.5","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.1.3","v4.1.4","v4.1.5","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.2.3","v4.2.4","v4.2.5","v4.2.6","v4.2.7","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.3.10","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v4.3.4","v4.3.5","v4.3.6","v4.3.7","v4.3.8","v4.3.9","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.4.2","v4.4.3","v4.4.4","v4.4.5","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.5.2","v4.5.3","v4.5.4","v4.6.0","v4.7.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-49275.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/49xxx/CVE-2023-49275.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/blob/e1d5231b31b68a75f3b8b33f833155b362411078/src/analysisd/decoders/syscollector.c#L1573"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/blob/e1d5231b31b68a75f3b8b33f833155b362411078/src/analysisd/decoders/syscollector.c#L1578"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/security/advisories/GHSA-4mq7-w9r6-9975"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49275"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-476"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/49xxx/CVE-2023-49275.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
