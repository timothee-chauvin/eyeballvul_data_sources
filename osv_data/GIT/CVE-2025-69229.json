{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-69229","published":"2026-01-05T23:37:52.955Z","modified":"2026-01-07T14:45:51.888460Z","aliases":["GHSA-g84x-mcqj-x9qq"],"related":["CGA-fxwq-49gq-9wrw"],"summary":"AIOHTTP vulnerable to DoS through chunked messages","details":"AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In versions 3.13.2 and below, handling of chunked messages can result in excessive blocking CPU usage when receiving a large number of chunks. If an application makes use of the request.read() method in an endpoint, it may be possible for an attacker to cause the server to spend a moderate amount of blocking CPU time (e.g. 1 second) while processing the request. This could potentially lead to DoS as the server would be unable to handle other requests during that time. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"41f01ed680b7efc8f97677df45731b80328aad6c"}]}],"versions":["0.15.2","0.8.2","1.3.0","2.0.0","2.0.0rc1","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.3-1","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","4v0.21.6","v.0.6.5","v0.1","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.14.4","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.15.3","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.16.3","v0.16.4","v0.16.5","v0.16.6","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.17.3","v0.17.4","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.18.3","v0.18.4","v0.19.0","v0.2","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.21.0","v0.21.0a0","v0.21.0a1","v0.21.0a2","v0.21.1","v0.21.2","v0.21.3","v0.21.4","v0.21.5","v0.21.6","v0.22.0","v0.22.0b0","v0.22.0b1","v0.22.0b2","v0.22.0b3","v0.22.0b4","v0.22.0b5","v0.22.0b6","v0.22.1","v0.22.2","v0.22.3","v0.22.4","v0.22.5","v0.3","v0.4","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.2.0","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.2.5","v2.3.0","v2.3.0a1","v2.3.0a2","v2.3.0a3","v2.3.0a4","v2.3.1","v2.3.10","v2.3.1a1","v2.3.2","v2.3.2b1","v2.3.2b2","v2.3.2b3","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.7","v2.3.8","v2.3.9","v3.0.0","v3.0.0b0","v3.0.0b1","v3.0.0b2","v3.0.0b3","v3.0.0b4","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.0.8","v3.0.9","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.10.0","v3.10.0b0","v3.10.0b1","v3.10.0rc0","v3.10.1","v3.10.10","v3.10.11","v3.10.11rc0","v3.10.2","v3.10.3","v3.10.4","v3.10.5","v3.10.6","v3.10.6rc0","v3.10.6rc1","v3.10.6rc2","v3.10.7","v3.10.8","v3.10.9","v3.11.0","v3.11.0b0","v3.11.0b1","v3.11.0b2","v3.11.0b3","v3.11.0b4","v3.11.0b5","v3.11.0rc0","v3.11.0rc1","v3.11.0rc2","v3.11.1","v3.11.10","v3.11.11","v3.11.12","v3.11.13","v3.11.14","v3.11.15","v3.11.16","v3.11.17","v3.11.18","v3.11.2","v3.11.3","v3.11.4","v3.11.5","v3.11.6","v3.11.7","v3.11.8","v3.11.9","v3.12.0","v3.12.0b0","v3.12.0b1","v3.12.0b2","v3.12.0b3","v3.12.0rc0","v3.12.0rc1","v3.12.1","v3.12.10","v3.12.11","v3.12.12","v3.12.13","v3.12.14","v3.12.15","v3.12.1rc0","v3.12.2","v3.12.3","v3.12.4","v3.12.5","v3.12.6","v3.12.7","v3.12.7rc0","v3.12.8","v3.12.9","v3.13.0","v3.13.1","v3.13.2","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.1b1","v3.3.2","v3.3.2a0","v3.4.0","v3.4.0a0","v3.4.0a3","v3.4.0b1","v3.4.0b2","v3.4.1","v3.4.2","v3.4.3","v3.4.4","v3.5.0","v3.5.0a1","v3.5.0b1","v3.5.0b2","v3.5.0b3","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.5.3","v3.5.4","v3.6.0","v3.6.0a0","v3.6.0a1","v3.6.0a10","v3.6.0a11","v3.6.0a12","v3.6.0a2","v3.6.0a3","v3.6.0a4","v3.6.0a5","v3.6.0a6","v3.6.0a7","v3.6.0a8","v3.6.0a9","v3.6.0b0","v3.6.1","v3.6.1b3","v3.6.1b4","v3.6.2","v3.6.2a1","v3.6.2a2","v3.7.0","v3.7.0b0","v3.7.0b1","v3.7.1","v3.7.2","v3.7.3","v3.7.4","v3.7.4.post0","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.8.2","v3.8.2a0","v3.8.3","v3.8.4","v3.8.5","v3.8.6","v3.9.0","v3.9.0b0","v3.9.0b1","v3.9.0rc0","v3.9.1","v3.9.2","v3.9.3","v3.9.4","v3.9.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-69229.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/69xxx/CVE-2025-69229.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/4ed97a4e46eaf61bd0f05063245f613469700229"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/dc3170b56904bdf814228fae70a5501a42a6c712"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-g84x-mcqj-x9qq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69229"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/69xxx/CVE-2025-69229.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
