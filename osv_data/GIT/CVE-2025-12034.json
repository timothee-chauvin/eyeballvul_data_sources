This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/peixotorms/fast-velocity-minify","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"55a8b53a2ec6d358f8d7ad181170b9d8112e78ab"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-12034.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/peixotorms/fast-velocity-minify/commit/55a8b53a2ec6d358f8d7ad181170b9d8112e78ab"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3383015%40fast-velocity-minify&new=3383015%40fast-velocity-minify&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1c02e03a-7f96-4efa-9071-4a76fb21900d?source=cve"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
