There is a stack consumption vulnerability resulting from infinite recursion in the functions next_is_type_qual() and cplus_demangle_type() in cp-demangle.c. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via an ELF file, as demonstrated by nm.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"af127c216949509e57ab2a28cc56c44e4e548813"}]}],"versions":["binu_ss_19990502","binutils-2_31","gdb-4_18-branchpoint","gdb-7.10-branchpoint","gdb-7.11-branchpoint","gdb-7.12-branchpoint","gdb-7.7-branchpoint","gdb-7.8-branchpoint","gdb-7.9-branchpoint","gdb-8.0-branchpoint","gdb-8.1-branchpoint","gdb_5_2-branchpoint","gdb_5_3-branchpoint","gdb_6_0-branchpoint","gdb_6_1-branchpoint","gdb_6_2-branchpoint","gdb_6_3-branchpoint","gdb_6_4-branchpoint","gdb_6_5-branchpoint","gdb_6_6-branchpoint","gdb_6_7-branchpoint","gdb_6_8-branchpoint","gdb_7_0-branchpoint","gdb_7_1-branchpoint","gdb_7_2-branchpoint","gdb_7_3-branchpoint","gdb_7_4-branchpoint","gdb_7_5-branchpoint","gdb_7_6-branchpoint","readline_4_0","users/ARM/embedded-binutils-master-2016q4","users/ARM/embedded-binutils-master-2017q4","users/ARM/embedded-gdb-master-2017q4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-18701.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4326-1/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4336-1/"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=87675"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
