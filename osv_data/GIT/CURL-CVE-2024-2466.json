  "summary": "TLS certificate check bypass with mbedTLS",
  "details": "libcurl did not check the server certificate of TLS connections done to a host\nspecified as an IP address, when built to use mbedTLS.\n\nlibcurl would wrongly avoid using the set hostname function when the specified\nhostname was given as an IP address, therefore completely skipping the\ncertificate check. This affects all uses of TLS protocols (HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS,\nPOPS3, SMTPS, etc).",
