{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68932","published":"2025-12-26T23:43:34.693Z","modified":"2025-12-31T10:11:25.558825Z","aliases":["GHSA-j9wc-gwc6-p786"],"summary":"FreshRSS has weak cryptographic randomness in remember-me token and nonce generation","details":"FreshRSS is a free, self-hostable RSS aggregator. Prior to version 1.28.0, FreshRSS uses cryptographically weak random number generators (mt_rand() and uniqid()) to generate remember-me authentication tokens and challenge-response nonces. This allows attackers to predict valid session tokens, leading to account takeover through persistent session hijacking. The remember-me tokens provide permanent authentication and are the sole credential for \"keep me logged in\" functionality. This issue has been patched in version 1.28.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freshrss/freshrss","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"fdd82820f16733b6e07def5b590fd94879e5a520"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.7.3","0.7.4","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.9.0","0.9.1","0.9.2","0.9.3","0.9.4","1.0.0","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2-beta","1.1.3-beta","1.10.0","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.11.0","1.11.1","1.11.2","1.12.0","1.13.0","1.13.1","1.14.0","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.15.0","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.15.3","1.16.0","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.17.0","1.18.0","1.18.1","1.19.0","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.2.0","1.20.0","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.21.0","1.22.0","1.22.1","1.23.0","1.23.1","1.24.0","1.24.1","1.24.2","1.24.3","1.25.0","1.26.0","1.26.1","1.26.2","1.26.3","1.27.0","1.27.1","1.3.0-beta","1.3.1-beta","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.7.0","1.8.0","1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68932.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68932.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/commit/57e1a375cbd2db9741ff19167813344f8eff5772"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/pull/8061"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/security/advisories/GHSA-j9wc-gwc6-p786"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68932"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-338"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68932.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
