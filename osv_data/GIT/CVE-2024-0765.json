Additionally, post-download, the data is deleted so no evidence would exist that the exfiltration occured.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"08d33cfd8fc47c5052b6ea29597c964a9da641e2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-0765.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/8978ab27-710c-44ce-bfd8-a2ea416dc786"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/08d33cfd8fc47c5052b6ea29597c964a9da641e2"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
