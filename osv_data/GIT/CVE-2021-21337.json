  "details": "Products.PluggableAuthService is a pluggable Zope authentication and authorization framework. In Products.PluggableAuthService before version 2.6.0 there is an open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link to the login form and login functionality could redirect the browser to a different website. The problem has been fixed in version 2.6.1. Depending on how you have installed Products.PluggableAuthService, you should change the buildout version pin to `2.6.1` and re-run the buildout, or if you used `pip` simply do `pip install \"Products.PluggableAuthService>=2.6.1\".",
