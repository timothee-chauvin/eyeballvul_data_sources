Starting in version 11.0.0 and prior to version 11.3.0, when setting `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` to \"public\", an unauthenticated user is able to do any of the supported operations (CRUD, subscriptions) with full admin privileges. This impacts any Directus instance that has either `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` set to `public` allowing unauthenticated users to subscribe for changes on any collection or do REST CRUD operations on user defined collections ignoring permissions. Version 11.3.0 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/directus/directus","events":[{"introduced":"2b02764ac8a4aac3df7764ca935ad7f9e48581b7"},{"fixed":"6948e1f9563cbfb6286fab3364ac245c8373797f"}]}],"versions":["v11.0.0","v11.0.1","v11.0.2","v11.1.0","v11.1.1","v11.1.2","v11.2.0","v11.2.1","v11.2.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-54151.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-849r-qrwj-8rv4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/ce0397d16cf767b5293cd57f626c5349b5732a21"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
