Since SW won't initialize stuffs for unsupported bands, NULL\ndereference will happen then in the sequence, rtw89_vif_rx_stats_iter() ->\nrtw89_core_cancel_6ghz_probe_tx(). So, add a check to avoid it.\n\nThe following is a crash log for this case.\n\n BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000032\n #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n #PF:
