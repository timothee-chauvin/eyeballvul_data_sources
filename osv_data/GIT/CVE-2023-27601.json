  "details": "OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed SDP body is received and is processed by the `delete_sdp_line` function in the sipmsgops module. This issue can be reproduced by calling the function with an SDP body that does not terminate by a line feed (i.e. `\\n`).\n\nThe vulnerability was found while performing black-box fuzzing against an OpenSIPS server running a configuration that made use of the functions `codec_delete_except_re` and `codec_delete_re`. The same issue was also discovered while performing coverage guided fuzzing on the function `codec_delete_except_re`. The crash happens because the function `delete_sdp_line` expects that an SDP line is terminated by a line feed (`\\n`):\n\nBy abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash the server. It affects configurations containing functions that rely on the affected code, such as the function `codec_delete_except_re`. Due to the sanity check that is performed in the `del_lump` function, exploitation of this issue will generate an `abort` in the lumps processing function, resulting in a Denial of Service. This issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.",
