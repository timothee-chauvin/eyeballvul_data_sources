This causes\nnfs_file_open_context() to oops - however, we don't actually need the nfs\ncontext as we're only going to write to the cache.\n\nFix this by just returning if we aren't given a file pointer and emit a\nwarning if the request was for something other than copy-to-cache.\n\nFurther, fix nfs_netfs_free_request() so that it doesn't try to free the\ncontext if the pointer is NULL.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ee4cdf7ba857a894ad1650d6ab77669cbbfa329e"},{"fixed":"13a07cc81e2d116cece727a83746c74b87a9d417"},{"fixed":"86ad1a58f6a9453f49e06ef957a40a8dac00a13f"}]}],"versions":["v6.11","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-57927.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-57927.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/13a07cc81e2d116cece727a83746c74b87a9d417"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/86ad1a58f6a9453f49e06ef957a40a8dac00a13f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/57xxx/CVE-2024-57927.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-57927"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/57xxx/CVE-2024-57927.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
