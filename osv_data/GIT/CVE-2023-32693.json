  "id": "CVE-2023-32693",
  "details": "Decidim is a participatory democracy framework, written in Ruby on Rails, originally developed for the Barcelona City government online and offline participation website. The external link feature is susceptible to cross-site scripting. This allows a remote attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of a currently logged-in user. An attacker could use this vulnerability to make other users endorse or support proposals they have no intention of supporting or endorsing. The problem was patched in versions 0.27.3 and 0.26.7.",
