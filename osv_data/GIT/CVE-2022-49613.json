Therefore,\nit will not call pm_runtime_get_sync(). Later, when the actual driver\nis going to take over univ8250_console_exit() is called. As .dev is\nalready set, serial8250_console_exit() makes pm_runtime_put_sync() call\nwith usage count being zero triggering PM usage count warning\n(extra debug for univ8250_console_setup(), univ8250_console_exit(), and\nserial8250_register_ports()):\n\n[    0.068987] univ8250_console_setup ttyS0 nodev\n[    0.499670] printk: console [ttyS0] enabled\n[    0.717955] printk: console [ttyS0] printing thread started\n[    1.960163] serial8250_register_ports assigned dev for ttyS0\n[    1.976830] printk: console [ttyS0] disabled\n[    1.976888] printk: console [ttyS0] printing thread stopped\n[    1.977073] univ8250_console_exit ttyS0 usage:0\n[    1.977075] serial8250 serial8250: Runtime PM usage count underflow!\n[    1.977429] dw-apb-uart.6: ttyS0 at MMIO 0x4010006000 (irq = 33, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A\n[    1.977812] univ8250_console_setup ttyS0 usage:2\n[    1.978167] printk: console [ttyS0] printing thread started\n[    1.978203] printk: console [ttyS0] enabled\n\nTo fix the issue, call pm_runtime_get_sync() in\nserial8250_register_ports() as soon as .dev is set for an uart_port\nif it has console enabled.\n\nThis problem became apparent only recently because 82586a721595 (\"PM:\nruntime: Avoid device usage count underflows\") added the warning\nprintout.
