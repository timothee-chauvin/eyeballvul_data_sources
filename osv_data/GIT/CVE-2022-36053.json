{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-36053","published":"2022-09-01T12:00:15Z","modified":"2025-11-19T11:07:47.473870Z","aliases":["GHSA-2j9c-7754-w4cw"],"summary":"Out-of-bounds read in the uIP buffer module","details":"Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. The low-power IPv6 network stack of Contiki-NG has a buffer module (os/net/ipv6/uipbuf.c) that processes IPv6 extension headers in incoming data packets. As part of this processing, the function uipbuf_get_next_header casts a pointer to a uip_ext_hdr structure into the packet buffer at different offsets where extension headers are expected to be found, and then reads from this structure. Because of a lack of bounds checking, the casting can be done so that the structure extends beyond the packet's end. Hence, with a carefully crafted packet, it is possible to cause the Contiki-NG system to read data outside the packet buffer. A patch that fixes the vulnerability is included in Contiki-NG 4.8.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9771e9aaebbfbb5633ce69eb9876e0fc70bbcd6f"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.8"}]}}],"versions":["2.0","2.1","2.2","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.3","2.4","2.5-release","2.6","2.6-rc0","3.x","develop/v3.x-fork","develop/v4.0","develop/v4.1","develop/v4.2","develop/v4.3","develop/v4.4","develop/v4.5","develop/v4.6","develop/v4.7","develop/v4.8","fork","old/v2.0","old/v2.1","old/v2.2","old/v2.2.1","old/v2.2.2","old/v2.2.3","old/v2.3","old/v2.4","old/v2.6","release/v4.0","release/v4.1","release/v4.2","release/v4.3","release/v4.4","release/v4.5","release/v4.6","release/v4.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-36053.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1648"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-2j9c-7754-w4cw"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-125"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
