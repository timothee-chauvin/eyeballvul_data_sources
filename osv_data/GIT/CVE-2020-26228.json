In TYPO3 before versions 9.5.23 and 10.4.10 user session identifiers were stored in cleartext - without processing with additional cryptographic hashing algorithms. This vulnerability cannot be exploited directly and occurs in combination with a chained attack - like for instance SQL injection in any other component of the system. Update to TYPO3 versions 9.5.23 or 10.4.10 that fix the problem described.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/typo3/typo3","events":[{"introduced":"c91b70e450c52d29ffb08115fffbb7832b15a330"},{"fixed":"05dd328bdc752c647316be991e593a79e71a1b08"}]}],"versions":["v10.0.0","v10.1.0","v10.2.0","v10.3.0","v10.4.0","v10.4.1","v10.4.2","v10.4.3","v10.4.4","v10.4.5","v10.4.6","v10.4.7","v10.4.8","v10.4.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-26228.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/typo3/typo3.cms","events":[{"introduced":"41235ff8e38c6f3401df03ae8beddd62d662c525"},{"fixed":"e444d4492ec188d1ef996ae413a296e34850c4ec"}]}],"versions":["v9.0.0","v9.1.0","v9.2.0","v9.3.0","v9.4.0","v9.5.0","v9.5.1","v9.5.10","v9.5.11","v9.5.12","v9.5.13","v9.5.14","v9.5.15","v9.5.16","v9.5.17","v9.5.18","v9.5.19","v9.5.2","v9.5.20","v9.5.21","v9.5.22","v9.5.3","v9.5.4","v9.5.5","v9.5.6","v9.5.7","v9.5.8","v9.5.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-26228.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-954j-f27r-cj52"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-011"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
