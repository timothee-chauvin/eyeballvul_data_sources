The client as\n> a result indefinitely retries the request.\n\nThe Linux NFS client does not handle NFS?ERR_INVAL, even though all\nNFS specifications permit servers to return that status code for a\nREAD.\n\nInstead of NFS?ERR_INVAL, have out-of-range READ requests succeed\nand return a short result. Set the EOF flag in the result to prevent\nthe client from retrying the READ request. This behavior appears to\nbe consistent with Solaris NFS servers.\n\nNote that NFSv3 and NFSv4 use u64 offset values on the wire. These\nmust be converted to loff_t internally before use -- an implicit\ntype cast is not adequate for this purpose. Otherwise VFS checks\nagainst sb->s_maxbytes do not work
