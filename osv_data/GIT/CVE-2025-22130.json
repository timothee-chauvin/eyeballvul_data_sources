Prior to 0.8.2 , a path traversal attack allows existing non-admin users to access and take over other user's repositories. A malicious user then can modify, delete, and arbitrarily repositories as if they were an admin user without explicitly giving them permissions. This is patched in v0.8.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"22d00e9db31e1f4d0c32beae1e8733883f4d80d8"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.5","v0.7.6","v0.8.0","v0.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-22130.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/security/advisories/GHSA-j4jw-m6xr-fv6c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/commit/a8d1bf3f9349c138383b65079b7b8ad97fff78f4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/releases/tag/v0.8.2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
