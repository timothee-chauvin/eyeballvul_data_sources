[0]\n\nThe problem is that iptable_nat_table_init() is exposed to user space\nbefore the kernel fully initialises netns.\n\nIn the small race window, a user could call iptable_nat_table_init()\nthat accesses net_generic(net, iptable_nat_net_id), which is available\nonly after registering iptable_nat_net_ops.\n\nLet's call register_pernet_subsys() before xt_register_template().\n\n[0]:\nbpfilter:
