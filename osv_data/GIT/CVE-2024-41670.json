{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-41670","published":"2024-07-26T14:46:14.226Z","modified":"2025-11-20T04:23:28.296106Z","aliases":["GHSA-w3w3-j3mh-3354"],"summary":"PayPal Official Module for PrestaShop has Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard","details":"In the module \"PayPal Official\" for PrestaShop 7+ releases prior to version 6.4.2 and for PrestaShop 1.6 releases prior to version 3.18.1, a malicious customer can confirm an order even if payment is finally declined by PayPal. A logical weakness during the capture of a payment in case of disabled webhooks can be exploited to create an accepted order. This could allow a threat actor to confirm an order with a fraudulent payment support. Versions 6.4.2 and 3.18.1 contain a patch for the issue. Additionally, users enable webhooks and check they are callable.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/202ecommerce/paypal","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"163e9d767737779d4245d08116251970aa0993c5"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.4.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/202ecommerce/paypal","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"eaf646deca10868d5803c30b6794b27266804d92"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.18.1"}]}}],"versions":["3.10.2","3.11.3","3.11.4","3.11.5","3.11.6","3.11.7","3.12.0","3.12.1","3.12.2","3.13.0","3.13.1","3.14.0","3.14.1","3.14.2","3.15.0","3.15.1","3.16.0","3.16.1","3.16.2","3.16.3","3.16.4","3.17.0","3.18.0","3.8.3","3.8.4","4.3.0","4.3.1","4.3.2","4.3.3","4.4.0","4.4.1","4.4.2","4.4.4","4.4.5","4.4.6","4.5.0","5.0.0","5.0.1","5.0.2","5.0.3","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.1.2","5.1.3","5.1.4","5.1.5","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.4.0","5.4.1","5.4.2","5.4.3","5.4.4","5.4.5","5.4.6","5.4.7","5.5.0","5.6.0","5.7.0","5.7.1","5.7.3","5.7.4","5.7.5","5.7.6","5.7.7","5.8.0","5.8.1","6.0.0","6.0.1","6.0.2","6.1.0","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.2.2","6.3.0","6.4.0","6.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-41670.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/202ecommerce/paypal/security/advisories/GHSA-w3w3-j3mh-3354"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-285","CWE-863"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
