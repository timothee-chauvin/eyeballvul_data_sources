{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-2913","published":"2024-05-07T00:15:08Z","modified":"2025-10-21T19:53:54.311583Z","details":"A race condition vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, specifically within the user invite acceptance process. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple concurrent requests to accept a single user invite, allowing the creation of multiple user accounts from a single invite link intended for only one user. This bypasses the intended security mechanism that restricts invite acceptance to a single user, leading to unauthorized user creation without detection in the invite tab. The issue is due to the lack of validation for concurrent requests in the backend.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"013c0b9575ae6a87af87275e326041c4e0afeeee"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-2913.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/a3c69faf-cca0-4c10-8739-57e5bef7a95f"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
