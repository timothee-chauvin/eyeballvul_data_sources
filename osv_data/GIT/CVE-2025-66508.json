{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-66508","published":"2025-12-09T01:37:10.219Z","modified":"2025-12-12T02:58:07.793053Z","aliases":["GHSA-7cqv-qcq2-r765"],"summary":"1Panel IP Access Control Bypass via Untrusted X-Forwarded-For Headers","details":"1Panel is an open-source, web-based control panel for Linux server management. Versions 2.0.14 and below use Gin's default configuration which trusts all IP addresses as proxies (TrustedProxies = 0.0.0.0/0), allowing any client to spoof the X-Forwarded-For header. Since all IP-based access controls (AllowIPs, API whitelists, localhost-only checks) rely on ClientIP(), attackers can bypass these protections by simply sending X-Forwarded-For:  127.0.0.1 or any whitelisted IP. This renders all IP-based security controls ineffective. This issue is fixed in version 2.0.14.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/1panel-dev/1panel","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b3350b54b3f885a03674b86642b9f1ff73cfb43f"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.10.0-lts","v1.10.1-lts","v1.10.10-lts","v1.10.12-beta","v1.10.2-lts","v1.10.3-lts","v1.10.4-lts","v1.10.5-lts","v1.10.7-lts","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v1.9.6","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.10","v2.0.11","v2.0.12","v2.0.13","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66508.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/commit/94f7d78cc9768ee244da33e09408017d1f68b5ed"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/security/advisories/GHSA-7cqv-qcq2-r765"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66508.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66508"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-290"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66508.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
