Prior to `puma` version `5.6.2`, `puma` may not always call `close` on the response body. Rails, prior to version `7.0.2.2`, depended on the response body being closed in order for its `CurrentAttributes` implementation to work correctly. The combination of these two behaviors (Puma not closing the body + Rails' Executor implementation) causes information leakage. This problem is fixed in Puma versions 5.6.2 and 4.3.11. This problem is fixed in Rails versions 7.02.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2. Upgrading to a patched Rails _or_ Puma version fixes the vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/puma/puma","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b70f451fe8abc0cff192c065d549778452e155bb"}]}],"versions":["rm","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.2","v2.0.0","v2.0.0.b2","v2.0.0.b3","v2.0.0.b4","v2.0.0.b5","v2.0.0.b6","v2.0.0.b7","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.10.2","v2.11.0","v2.11.2","v2.11.3","v2.12.0","v2.12.1","v2.12.2","v2.12.3","v2.13.0","v2.13.1","v2.13.2","v2.13.3","v2.13.4","v2.14.0","v2.15.0","v2.15.1","v2.15.2","v2.15.3","v2.16.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v2.9.2","v3.0.0","v3.0.0.rc1","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.10.0","v3.11.0","v3.11.1","v3.11.2","v3.11.3","v3.11.4","v3.12.0","v3.12.1","v3.2.0","v3.3.0","v3.4.0","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.6.0","v3.7.1","v3.8.0","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.1.0","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.3.0","v5.0.0","v5.0.0.beta1","v5.0.0.beta2","v5.0.1","v5.0.2","v5.0.3","v5.1.0","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.2.2","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.4.0","v5.5.0","v5.5.1","v5.5.2","v5.6.0","v5.6.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23634.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rails/rails","events":[{"introduced":"2efddadd6cba4e2129acedf1d402d11abcc03996"},{"fixed":"46fe51b4875ba947cd3317cef420042f22aa8ffd"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23634.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rmj8-8hhh-gv5h"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/puma/puma/commit/b70f451fe8abc0cff192c065d549778452e155bb"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-rmj8-8hhh-gv5h"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/ruby-security-ann/c/FkTM-_7zSNA/m/K2RiMJBlBAAJ?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer&pli=1"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00034.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/08/msg00015.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F6YWGIIKL7KKTS3ZOAYMYPC7D6WQ5OA5/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L7NESIBFCNSR3XH7LXDPKVMSUBNUB43G/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TUBFJ44NCKJ34LECZRAP4N5VL6USJSIB/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-28"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5146"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
