{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62429","published":"2025-10-20T16:08:02Z","modified":"2025-10-31T02:44:59.274772Z","aliases":["GHSA-3x4g-x3gv-rjmq"],"summary":"ClipBucket v5 executes arbitrary PHP code","details":"ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. Prior to version 5.5.2 #147, ClipBucket v5 is vulnerable to arbitrary PHP code execution. In /upload/admin_area/actions/update_launch.php, the \"type\" parameter from a POST request is embedded into PHP tags and executed. Proper sanitization is not performed, and by injecting malicious code an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code. This allows an attacker to achieve RCE. This issue has been resolved in version 5.5.2 #147.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/macwarrior/clipbucket-v5","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"97b02b8cb780abb1fe21a6c1b1fa39238a559a19"},{"fixed":"e81bac602c871bb1ad971884003a3a496a2ab50b"}]}],"versions":["5.3","5.3.1","5.4.0","5.4.1","5.5.0","5.5.1","5.5.2-#103","5.5.2-#106","5.5.2-#114","5.5.2-#117","5.5.2-#120","5.5.2-#123","5.5.2-#129","5.5.2-#133","5.5.2-#135","5.5.2-#138","5.5.2-#140","5.5.2-#25","5.5.2-#38","5.5.2-#4","5.5.2-#45","5.5.2-#58","5.5.2-#69","5.5.2-#74","5.5.2-#82","5.5.2-#86","5.5.2-#90","5.5.2-#98"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62429.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-3x4g-x3gv-rjmq"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/commit/e81bac602c871bb1ad971884003a3a496a2ab50b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/releases/tag/5.5.2-%23147"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
