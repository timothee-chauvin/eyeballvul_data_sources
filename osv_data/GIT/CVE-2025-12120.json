{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-12120","published":"2025-11-20T17:15:48.640Z","modified":"2025-12-12T02:58:00.949608Z","details":"Lite XL versions 2.1.8 and prior automatically execute the .lite_project.lua file when opening a project directory, without prompting the user for confirmation. The .lite_project.lua file is intended for project-specific configuration but can contain executable Lua logic. This behavior could allow execution of untrusted Lua code if a user opens a malicious project, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Lite XL process.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0af4dae0e2748d6afe7bded41c13d96f627cb520"}]}],"versions":["1.06-subpixel-rc1","testing-2.0.2","testing-2.0.3","testing-2.0.4","v1.0","v1.01","v1.02","v1.03","v1.04","v1.05","v1.06","v1.07","v1.08","v1.08-subpixel","v1.09","v1.10","v1.10-lite-xl","v1.11","v1.11-lite-xl","v1.12-lite-xl","v1.13-lite-xl","v1.14-lite-xl","v1.14.1-lite-xl","v1.15-lite-xl","v1.15.1-lite-xl","v1.15.2-lite-xl","v1.15.3-lite-xl","v1.16.0-lite-xl","v1.16.1-lite-xl","v1.16.10","v1.16.11","v1.16.12","v1.16.2-lite-xl","v1.16.3-lite-xl","v1.16.4","v1.16.5","v1.16.6","v1.16.6-sdl-renderer-1","v1.16.6-sdl-renderer-2","v1.16.7","v1.16.8","v1.16.9","v1.16.9-dev-1","v2.0-beta1","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.3-rc1","v2.1.3-rc2","v2.1.4","v2.1.4-rc1","v2.1.5","v2.1.6","v2.1.7","v2.1.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-12120.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/579478"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/2164"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
