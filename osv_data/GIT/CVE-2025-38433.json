To fix it just adjust the logic to ensure that the second `else`\nbranch is not taken if the first instruction will be patched to a `nop`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a44fb5722199de8338d991db5ad3d509192179bb"},{"fixed":"0a24b00dcde83934a3cc13e4c6b775522903496b"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a44fb5722199de8338d991db5ad3d509192179bb"},{"fixed":"8d90d9872edae7e78c3a12b98e239bfaa66f3639"}]}],"versions":["v6.14","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.15.1","v6.15.2","v6.15.3","v6.15.4","v6.16-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38433.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.15.0"},{"fixed":"6.15.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38433.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0a24b00dcde83934a3cc13e4c6b775522903496b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d90d9872edae7e78c3a12b98e239bfaa66f3639"}]}
