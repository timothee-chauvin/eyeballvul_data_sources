{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-49800","published":"2023-12-08T23:41:55Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:40:51.838377Z","aliases":["GHSA-q6hx-3m4p-749h"],"summary":"Denial of service by abusing `fetchOptions.retry` in nuxt-api-party","details":"`nuxt-api-party` is an open source module to proxy API requests. The library allows the user to send many options directly to `ofetch`. There is no filter on which options are available. We can abuse the retry logic to cause the server to crash from a stack overflow. fetchOptions are obtained directly from the request body. A malicious user can construct a URL known  to not fetch successfully, then set the retry attempts to a high value, this will cause a stack overflow as ofetch error handling works recursively resulting in a denial of service. This issue has been addressed in version 0.22.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should limit ofetch options.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/johannschopplich/nuxt-api-party","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b13d6eff070631780b75ff134625eb1ffc096faa"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.1.9","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.10.3","v0.10.4","v0.10.5","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.11.2","v0.11.3","v0.11.4","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.15.3","v0.15.4","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.16.3","v0.16.4","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.19.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.21.2","v0.21.3","v0.22.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-49800.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/johannschopplich/nuxt-api-party/security/advisories/GHSA-q6hx-3m4p-749h"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400","CWE-674"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
