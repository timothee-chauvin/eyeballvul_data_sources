{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-31180","published":"2022-08-01T19:15:16Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:31:46.882876Z","aliases":["GHSA-44vr-rwwj-p88h"],"summary":"Insufficient escaping of whitespace in shescape","details":"Shescape is a simple shell escape package for JavaScript. Affected versions were found to have insufficient escaping of white space when interpolating output. This issue only impacts users that use the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. The result is that if an attacker is able to include whitespace in their input they can: 1. Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific special characters inserted directly after whitespace. 2. Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific special characters inserted or appearing after line terminating characters. 3. Invoke arbitrary commands by inserting a line feed character. 4. Invoke arbitrary commands by inserting a carriage return character. Behaviour number 1 has been patched in [v1.5.7] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. Behaviour number 2, 3, and 4 have been patched in [v1.5.8] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. The best workaround is to avoid having to use the `interpolation: true` option - in most cases using an alternative is possible, see [the recipes](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape#recipes) for recommendations. Alternatively, users may strip all whitespace from user input. Note that this is error prone, for example: for PowerShell this requires stripping `'\\u0085'` which is not included in JavaScript's definition of `\\s` for Regular Expressions.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"10e1d0f64f38f97dac07d9a5ef1bd394393ed4b8"},{"fixed":"8b6a0eefe08f9cd4340c3364aa90dda0acb31f18"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.5.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31180.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/security/advisories/GHSA-44vr-rwwj-p88h"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/322"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/324"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.8"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-74"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
