Affected versions of FreeRDP are subject to a Null Pointer Dereference leading a crash in the RemoteFX (rfx) handling.  Inside the `rfx_process_message_tileset` function, the program allocates tiles using `rfx_allocate_tiles` for the number of numTiles. If the initialization process of tiles is not completed for various reasons, tiles will have a NULL pointer. Which may be accessed in further processing and would cause a program crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freerdp/freerdp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1384b3c33b9bd7599633cc54bf20cf20ec6be83c"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.11.0"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freerdp/freerdp","events":[{"introduced":"f468a06d88c55b9ed484757326a9528cf27d33f4"},{"fixed":"59a5726ab36338776539192cae2563951d0ce94b"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.0.0-beta1"},{"fixed":"3.0.0-beta3"}]}}],"versions":["1.0-beta1","1.0-beta2","1.0-beta3","1.0-beta4","1.0-beta5","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0-beta+2013071101","1.1.0-beta1","1.1.0-beta1+android2","1.1.0-beta1+android3","1.1.0-beta1+android4","1.1.0-beta1+android5","1.1.0-beta1+ios1","1.1.0-beta1+ios2","1.1.0-beta1+ios3","1.1.0-beta1+ios4","1.2.0-beta1+android7","1.2.0-beta1+android9","2.0.0","2.0.0-beta1+android10","2.0.0-beta1+android11","2.0.0-rc0","2.0.0-rc1","2.0.0-rc2","2.0.0-rc3","2.0.0-rc4","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.10.0","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.4.1","2.5.0","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.9.0","3.0.0-beta1","3.0.0-beta2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-39351.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/39xxx/CVE-2023-39351.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/security/advisories/GHSA-q9x9-cqjc-rgwq"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00008.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/02/msg00016.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A6LLDAPEXRDJOM3PREDDD267SSNT77DP/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IHMTGKCZXJPQOR5ZD2I4GPDNP2DKRXMF/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OH2ATH2BKDNKCJAU4WPPXK4SHLE3UJUV/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39351"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-16"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-476"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/39xxx/CVE-2023-39351.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
