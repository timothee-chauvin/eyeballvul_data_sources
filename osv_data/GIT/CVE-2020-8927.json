It is recommended to update your Brotli library to 1.0.8 or later. If one cannot update, we recommend to use the \"streaming\" API as opposed to the \"one-shot\" API, and impose chunk size limits.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dotnet/core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8b41c63650f1c1223ce82de5d9040c1f7ff470c1"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.7","v1.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-preview1","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.4","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-preview1","v2.0.0-preview2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-8927.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/google/brotli","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e61745a6b7add50d380cfd7d3883dd6c62fc2c71"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.6.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-8927.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/powershell/powershell","events":[{"introduced":"b54b188c1804d4dcebb09a8be3a67916abd94fd7"},{"fixed":"3269c95a72af9a3a161884dbae99eae0352b3e7d"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-8927.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-09/msg00108.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/google/brotli/releases/tag/v1.0.9"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/12/msg00003.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4568-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4801"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/356JOYTWW4BWSZ42SEFLV7NYHL3S3AEH/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4TOGTZ2ZWDH662ZNFFSZVL3M5AJXV6JF/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J4E265WKWKYMK2RYYSIXBEGZTDY5IQE6/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M4VCDOJGL6BK3HB4XRD2WETBPYX2ITF6/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MMBKACMLSRX7JJSKBTR35UOEP2WFR6QP/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MQLM7ABVCYJLF6JRPF3M3EBXW63GNC27/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/W23CUADGMVMQQNFKHPHXVP7RPZJZNN6I/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WW62OZEY2GHJL4JCOLJRBSRETXDHMWRK/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZXEQ3GQVELA2T4HNZG7VPMS2HDVXMJRG/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"}]}
