When Git LFS requests credentials from Git for a remote host, it passes portions of the host's URL to the `git-credential(1)` command without checking for embedded line-ending control characters, and then sends any credentials it receives back from the Git credential helper to the remote host. By inserting URL-encoded control characters such as line feed (LF) or carriage return (CR) characters into the URL, an attacker may be able to retrieve a user's Git credentials. This problem exists in all previous versions and is patched in v3.6.1. All users should upgrade to v3.6.1. There are no workarounds known at this time.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs","events":[{"introduced":"4843542e284497c1e3745eed63059f791604868e"},{"fixed":"ea47a34bde1ba1ecf9eb8dc6d44fcf7aef42f5e3"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.1-p1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.5.0","v0.5.0.pre1","v0.5.1","v0.5.1-tracing","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.6.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.1-pre-push-tracing","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.5.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.2-rc1","v2.1.0","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.12.0","v2.13.0","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0","v3.0.0","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v3.3.0","v3.4.0","v3.5.0","v3.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-53263.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/0345b6f816e611d050c0df67b61f0022916a1c90"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/tag/v3.6.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/security/advisories/GHSA-q6r2-x2cc-vrp7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/01/msg00022.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-74"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
