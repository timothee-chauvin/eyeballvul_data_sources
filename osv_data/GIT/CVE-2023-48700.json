  "details": "The Nautobot Device Onboarding plugin uses the netmiko and NAPALM libraries to simplify the onboarding process of a new device into Nautobot down to, in many cases, an IP Address and a Location. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 3.0.0, credentials provided to onboarding task are visible via Job Results from an execution of an Onboarding Task. Version 3.0.0 fixes this issue; no known workarounds are available. Mitigation recommendations include deleting all Job Results for any onboarding task to remove clear text credentials from database entries that were run while on v2.0.X, upgrading to v3.0.0, and rotating any exposed credentials.",
