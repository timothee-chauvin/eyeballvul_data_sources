In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/x-stream/xstream","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b9ad1c02724c2b1636a8794c8e1bcd630f46c0b3"}]}],"versions":["XSTREAM_1_4_10","XSTREAM_1_4_11","XSTREAM_1_4_11_1","XSTREAM_1_4_12","XSTREAM_1_4_13","XSTREAM_1_4_14","XSTREAM_1_4_15","XSTREAM_1_4_16","XSTREAM_1_4_17","XSTREAM_1_4_5","XSTREAM_1_4_9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-39149.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-3ccq-5vw3-2p6x"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/09/msg00017.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210923-0003/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5004"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-39149.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/22KVR6B5IZP3BGQ3HPWIO2FWWCKT3DHP/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PVPHZA7VW2RRSDCOIPP2W6O5ND254TU7/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGXIU3YDPG6OGTDHMBLAFN7BPBERXREB/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
