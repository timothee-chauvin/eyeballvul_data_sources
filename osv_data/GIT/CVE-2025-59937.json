In versions 0.7.0 and below, due to incorrect handling of the mail.Address values when a sender- or recipient address is passed to the corresponding MAIL FROM or RCPT TO commands of the SMTP client, there is a possibility of wrong address routing or even ESMTP parameter smuggling. For successful exploitation, it is required that the user's code allows for arbitrary mail address input (i. e. through a web form or similar). If only static mail addresses are used (i. e. in a config file) and the mail addresses in use do not consist of quoted local parts, this should not affect users. This issue is fixed in version 0.7.1","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wneessen/go-mail","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"42e92cfe027be04aff72921adb0f72f11d517479"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.1.9","v0.1.9-beta.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.8","v0.2.9","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.3.8","v0.3.9","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.7.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59937.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/59xxx/CVE-2025-59937.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/wneessen/go-mail/commit/42e92cfe027be04aff72921adb0f72f11d517479"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/wneessen/go-mail/issues/495"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/wneessen/go-mail/pull/496"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/wneessen/go-mail/security/advisories/GHSA-wpwj-69cm-q9c5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59937"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-88"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/59xxx/CVE-2025-59937.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
