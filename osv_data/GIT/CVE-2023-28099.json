{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-28099","published":"2023-03-15T22:16:57.958Z","modified":"2025-12-04T23:45:07.790977Z","aliases":["GHSA-pfm5-6vhv-3ff3"],"summary":"OpenSIPS has vulnerability in the ds_is_in_list() function","details":"OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6, if `ds_is_in_list()` is used with an invalid IP address string (`NULL` is illegal input), OpenSIPS will attempt to print a string from a random address (stack garbage), which could lead to a crash.  All users of `ds_is_in_list()` without the `$si` variable as 1st parameter could be affected by this vulnerability to a larger, lesser or no extent at all, depending if the data passed to the function is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address string or not. Fixes will are available starting with the 3.1.9 and 3.2.6 minor releases. There are no known workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opensips/opensips","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"949719bf4baeb5da9787b9c4191e061fe800d9eb"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.9"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opensips/opensips","events":[{"introduced":"1e94abe8837fe3511fada132d67a6385d8d099a2"},{"fixed":"ce8cda891ce6cc48ff7dc2e75f683e4e45798c6c"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.2.0"},{"fixed":"3.2.6"}]}}],"versions":["1.11.0","2.1-alpha1","2.1-alpha2","2.1-alpha3","2.1-rc1","3.1.0","3.1.0-beta","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.1.4","3.1.5","3.1.6","3.1.7","3.1.8","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.2.4","3.2.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-28099.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/28xxx/CVE-2023-28099.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/e2f13d374"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/issues/2780"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-pfm5-6vhv-3ff3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28099"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-20"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/28xxx/CVE-2023-28099.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
