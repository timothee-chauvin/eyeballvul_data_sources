The value is stored in the adapter structure\nand to access it, vport pointer is used. During reset all the vports\nare released and the vport pointer that the netdev private structure\npoints to is NULL.\n\nTo avoid null-ptr-deref, store the max header length value in netdev\nprivate structure. This also helps to cache the value and avoid\naccessing adapter pointer in hot path.\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000068\n...\nRIP: 0010:idpf_features_check+0x6d/0xe0 [idpf]\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n ? __die+0x23/0x70\n ? page_fault_oops+0x154/0x520\n ? exc_page_fault+0x76/0x190\n ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30\n ? idpf_features_check+0x6d/0xe0 [idpf]\n netif_skb_features+0x88/0x310\n validate_xmit_skb+0x2a/0x2b0\n validate_xmit_skb_list+0x4c/0x70\n sch_direct_xmit+0x19d/0x3a0\n __dev_queue_xmit+0xb74/0xe70\n ...","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a251eee62133774cf35ff829041377e721ef9c8c"},{"fixed":"f6f5e9c8cb680c3cb9771fd9fa114319cbc4f514"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a251eee62133774cf35ff829041377e721ef9c8c"},{"fixed":"bf1e751c5a5611aa037ab44cca955c141eb68dcc"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a251eee62133774cf35ff829041377e721ef9c8c"},{"fixed":"2dabe349f7882ff1407a784d54d8541909329088"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.14.1","v6.14.2","v6.14.3","v6.14.4","v6.14.5","v6.14.6","v6.14.7","v6.14.8","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38053.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.31"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.14.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38053.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2dabe349f7882ff1407a784d54d8541909329088"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bf1e751c5a5611aa037ab44cca955c141eb68dcc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f6f5e9c8cb680c3cb9771fd9fa114319cbc4f514"}]}
