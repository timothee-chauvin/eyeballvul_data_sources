{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-45140","published":"2023-11-08T15:26:26.584Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:22:07.883754Z","aliases":["GHSA-pr4q-w883-pf5x"],"summary":"Group-based JIT MFA bypass on scp and sftp in The Bastion","details":"The Bastion provides authentication, authorization, traceability and auditability for SSH accesses. SCP and SFTP plugins don't honor group-based JIT MFA. Establishing a SCP/SFTP connection through The Bastion via a group access where MFA is enforced does not ask for additional factor. This abnormal behavior only applies to per-group-based JIT MFA. Other MFA setup types, such as Immediate MFA, JIT MFA on a per-plugin basis and JIT MFA on a per-account basis are not affected. This issue has been patched in version 3.14.15.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ovh/the-bastion","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"137c7b54540595f557debe3c804f00553119bd60"}]}],"versions":["v3.00.00","v3.00.01","v3.00.02","v3.01.00","v3.01.01","v3.01.02","v3.01.03","v3.01.99-rc1","v3.01.99-rc2","v3.01.99-rc3","v3.01.99-rc4","v3.02.00","v3.03.00","v3.03.01","v3.03.99-rc1","v3.03.99-rc2","v3.04.00","v3.05.00","v3.05.01","v3.06.00","v3.07.00","v3.08.00","v3.08.01","v3.09.00","v3.09.00-rc1","v3.09.00-rc2","v3.09.00-rc3","v3.09.00-really","v3.09.02","v3.10.00","v3.11.00","v3.11.01","v3.11.02","v3.12.00","v3.13.00","v3.13.01","v3.14.00"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-45140.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ovh/the-bastion/releases/tag/v3.14.15"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ovh/the-bastion/security/advisories/GHSA-pr4q-w883-pf5x"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-306"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
