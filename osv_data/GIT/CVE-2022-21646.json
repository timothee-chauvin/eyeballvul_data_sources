Any user making use of a wildcard relationship under the right hand branch of an `exclusion` or within an `intersection` operation will see `Lookup`/`LookupResources` return a resource as \"accessible\" if it is *not* accessible by virtue of the inclusion of the wildcard in the intersection or the right side of the exclusion. In `v1.3.0`, the wildcard is ignored entirely in lookup's dispatch, resulting in the `banned` wildcard being ignored in the exclusion. Version 1.4.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, don't make use of wildcards on the right side of intersections or within exclusions.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d1b6877c2f24dbe631767355f1ae6f940ae03916"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-21646.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/15bba2e2d2a4bda336a37a7fe8ef8a35028cd970"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/issues/358"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.4.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-7p8f-8hjm-wm92"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-155","CWE-20"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
