It is available as an npm package and can be installed via `npm install -g interactive-git-checkout`. Versions up to and including 1.1.4 of the `interactive-git-checkout` tool are vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability because the software passes the branch name to the `git checkout` command using the Node.js child process module's `exec()` function without proper input validation or sanitization.
