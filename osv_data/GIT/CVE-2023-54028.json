function rxe_create_qp(), rxe_qp_from_init() is called to\ninitialize qp, internally things like rxe_init_task are not setup until\nrxe_qp_init_req().\n\nIf an error occurred before this point then the unwind will call\nrxe_cleanup() and eventually to rxe_qp_do_cleanup()/rxe_cleanup_task()\nwhich will oops when trying to access the uninitialized spinlock.\n\nIf rxe_init_task is not executed, rxe_cleanup_task will not be
