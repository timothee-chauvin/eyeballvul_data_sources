Access to the font glyphs in xrdp_painter.c is not bounds-checked . Since some of this data is controllable by the user, this can result in an out-of-bounds read within the xrdp executable. The vulnerability allows an out-of-bounds read within a potentially privileged process. On non-Debian platforms, xrdp tends to run as root. Potentially an out-of-bounds write can follow the out-of-bounds read. There is no denial-of-service impact, providing xrdp is running in forking mode. This issue has been addressed in release 0.9.23.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1b49f82e398ebf7c0a46e2edaac5e1c8f0204aa6"}]}],"versions":["v0.9.1","v0.9.10","v0.9.11","v0.9.12","v0.9.13","v0.9.13.1","v0.9.14","v0.9.15","v0.9.16","v0.9.17","v0.9.18","v0.9.18.1","v0.9.19","v0.9.2","v0.9.20","v0.9.21","v0.9.21.1","v0.9.22","v0.9.22.1","v0.9.23","v0.9.3","v0.9.3.1","v0.9.3.rc1","v0.9.4","v0.9.4.rc1","v0.9.5","v0.9.6","v0.9.7","v0.9.8","v0.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-42822.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/security/advisories/GHSA-2hjx-rm4f-r9hw"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/commit/73acbe1f7957c65122b00de4d6f57a8d0d257c40"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5FPGA4M7IYCP7OILDF2ZJEVSXUOFEFQ6/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PFGL22QQF65OIZRMCKUZCVJQCKGUBRYE/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RTXODUR4ILM7ZPA6ZGY6VSK4BBSBMKGY/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-125"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
