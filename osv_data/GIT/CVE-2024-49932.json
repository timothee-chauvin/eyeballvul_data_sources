doing readahead on the relocation inode, but if the\nfilesystem is backed by a RAID stripe tree we can get ENOENT (e.g. due to\npreallocated extents not being mapped in the RST) from the lookup.\n\nBut readahead doesn't handle the error and submits invalid reads to the\ndevice, causing an assertion in the scatter-gather list code:\n\n  BTRFS info (device nvme1n1): balance: start -d -m
