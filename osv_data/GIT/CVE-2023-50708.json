In yii2-authclient prior to version 2.2.15, the Oauth1/2 `state` and OpenID Connect `nonce` is vulnerable for a `timing attack` since it is compared via regular string comparison (instead of `Yii::$app->getSecurity()->compareString()`). Version 2.2.15 contains a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-authclient","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a11cbb065a2424c25f9dc0d0df6852d605d869b2"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.0.0-beta","2.0.0-rc","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.1.7","2.1.8","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.10","2.2.11","2.2.12","2.2.13","2.2.14","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.2.4","2.2.6","2.2.7","2.2.8","2.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-50708.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/50xxx/CVE-2023-50708.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-authclient/blob/0d1c3880f4d79e20aa1d77c012650b54e69695ff/src/OAuth1.php#L158"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-authclient/blob/0d1c3880f4d79e20aa1d77c012650b54e69695ff/src/OAuth2.php#L121"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-authclient/blob/0d1c3880f4d79e20aa1d77c012650b54e69695ff/src/OpenIdConnect.php#L420"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-authclient/commit/dabddf2154ab7e7703740205a069202554089248"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-authclient/security/advisories/GHSA-w8vh-p74j-x9xp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50708"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-203"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/50xxx/CVE-2023-50708.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
