NOTE: the vendor disputes this, stating \"There is no security issue here, because GMP safely aborts in case of an OOM condition. The only attack vector here is denial of service. However, if you allow attacker-controlled, unbounded allocations you have a DoS vector regardless of GMP's OOM behavior.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/php/php-src","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1f68c9d76498819fc504bda226dd034491f73ed3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-7963.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=74308"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
