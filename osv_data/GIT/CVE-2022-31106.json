{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-31106","published":"2022-06-28T17:30:14Z","modified":"2025-12-04T10:23:56.915945Z","aliases":["GHSA-8j79-hfj5-f2xm"],"summary":"Prototype Pollution in underscore.deep","details":"Underscore.deep is a collection of Underscore mixins that operate on nested objects. Versions of `underscore.deep` prior to version 0.5.3 are vulnerable to a prototype pollution vulnerability. An attacker can craft a malicious payload and pass it to `deepFromFlat`, which would pollute any future Objects created. Any users that have `deepFromFlat` or `deepPick` (due to its dependency on `deepFromFlat`) in their code should upgrade to version 0.5.3 as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by modifying `deepFromFlat` to prevent specific keywords which will prevent this from happening.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/clever/underscore.deep","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b5e109ad05b48371be225fa4d490dd08a94e8ef7"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31106.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/31xxx/CVE-2022-31106.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Clever/underscore.deep/commit/b5e109ad05b48371be225fa4d490dd08a94e8ef7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Clever/underscore.deep/security/advisories/GHSA-8j79-hfj5-f2xm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31106"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-1321","CWE-915"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/31xxx/CVE-2022-31106.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
