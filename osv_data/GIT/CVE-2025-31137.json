There is a vulnerability in Remix/React Router that affects all Remix 2 and React Router 7 consumers using the Express adapter. Basically, this vulnerability allows anyone to spoof the URL used in an incoming Request by putting a URL pathname in the port section of a URL that is part of a Host or X-Forwarded-Host header sent to a Remix/React Router request handler. This issue has been patched and released in Remix 2.16.3 and React Router 7.4.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router","events":[{"introduced":"e8e3b004d94a949372e77ce97a543bff5bc6fb89"},{"fixed":"7350eef4e937e910308bcedd8254a4bba53058a6"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"7.0.0"},{"fixed":"7.4.1"}]}}],"versions":["@react-router/architect@7.0.0","@react-router/architect@7.0.1","@react-router/architect@7.0.2","@react-router/architect@7.1.0","@react-router/architect@7.1.1","@react-router/architect@7.1.2","@react-router/architect@7.1.3","@react-router/architect@7.1.4","@react-router/architect@7.1.5","@react-router/architect@7.2.0","@react-router/architect@7.3.0","@react-router/architect@7.4.0","@react-router/cloudflare@7.0.0","@react-router/cloudflare@7.0.1","@react-router/cloudflare@7.0.2","@react-router/cloudflare@7.1.0","@react-router/cloudflare@7.1.1","@react-router/cloudflare@7.1.2","@react-router/cloudflare@7.1.3","@react-router/cloudflare@7.1.4","@react-router/cloudflare@7.1.5","@react-router/cloudflare@7.2.0","@react-router/cloudflare@7.3.0","@react-router/cloudflare@7.4.0","@react-router/dev@7.0.0","@react-router/dev@7.0.1","@react-router/dev@7.0.2","@react-router/dev@7.1.0","@react-router/dev@7.1.1","@react-router/dev@7.1.2","@react-router/dev@7.1.3","@react-router/dev@7.1.4","@react-router/dev@7.1.5","@react-router/dev@7.2.0","@react-router/dev@7.3.0","@react-router/dev@7.4.0","@react-router/express@7.0.0","@react-router/express@7.0.1","@react-router/express@7.0.2","@react-router/express@7.1.0","@react-router/express@7.1.1","@react-router/express@7.1.2","@react-router/express@7.1.3","@react-router/express@7.1.4","@react-router/express@7.1.5","@react-router/express@7.2.0","@react-router/express@7.3.0","@react-router/express@7.4.0","@react-router/fs-routes@7.0.0","@react-router/fs-routes@7.0.1","@react-router/fs-routes@7.0.2","@react-router/fs-routes@7.1.0","@react-router/fs-routes@7.1.1","@react-router/fs-routes@7.1.2","@react-router/fs-routes@7.1.3","@react-router/fs-routes@7.1.4","@react-router/fs-routes@7.1.5","@react-router/fs-routes@7.2.0","@react-router/fs-routes@7.3.0","@react-router/fs-routes@7.4.0","@react-router/node@7.0.0","@react-router/node@7.0.1","@react-router/node@7.0.2","@react-router/node@7.1.0","@react-router/node@7.1.1","@react-router/node@7.1.2","@react-router/node@7.1.3","@react-router/node@7.1.4","@react-router/node@7.1.5","@react-router/node@7.2.0","@react-router/node@7.3.0","@react-router/node@7.4.0","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.0.0","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.0.1","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.0.2","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.1.0","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.1.1","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.1.2","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.1.3","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.1.4","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.1.5","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.2.0","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.3.0","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.4.0","@react-router/serve@7.0.0","@react-router/serve@7.0.1","@react-router/serve@7.0.2","@react-router/serve@7.1.0","@react-router/serve@7.1.1","@react-router/serve@7.1.2","@react-router/serve@7.1.3","@react-router/serve@7.1.4","@react-router/serve@7.1.5","@react-router/serve@7.2.0","@react-router/serve@7.3.0","@react-router/serve@7.4.0","create-react-router@7.0.0","create-react-router@7.0.1","create-react-router@7.0.2","create-react-router@7.1.0","create-react-router@7.1.1","create-react-router@7.1.2","create-react-router@7.1.3","create-react-router@7.1.4","create-react-router@7.1.5","create-react-router@7.2.0","create-react-router@7.3.0","create-react-router@7.4.0","react-router-dom@7.0.0","react-router-dom@7.0.1","react-router-dom@7.0.2","react-router-dom@7.1.0","react-router-dom@7.1.1","react-router-dom@7.1.2","react-router-dom@7.1.3","react-router-dom@7.1.4","react-router-dom@7.1.5","react-router-dom@7.2.0","react-router-dom@7.3.0","react-router-dom@7.4.0","react-router@7.0.0","react-router@7.0.1","react-router@7.0.2","react-router@7.1.0","react-router@7.1.1","react-router@7.1.2","react-router@7.1.3","react-router@7.1.4","react-router@7.1.5","react-router@7.2.0","react-router@7.3.0","react-router@7.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-31137.json","unresolved_ranges":[{"events":[{"introduced":"2.11.1"},{"fixed":"2.16.3"}]}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/security/advisories/GHSA-4q56-crqp-v477"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-444"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
