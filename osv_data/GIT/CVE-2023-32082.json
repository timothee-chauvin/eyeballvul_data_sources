{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-32082","published":"2023-05-11T19:22:56Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:13:09.725016Z","aliases":["BIT-etcd-2023-32082","GHSA-3p4g-rcw5-8298"],"summary":"etcd key name can be accessed via LeaseTimeToLive API","details":"etcd is a distributed key-value store for the data of a distributed system. Prior to versions 3.4.26 and 3.5.9, the LeaseTimeToLive API allows access to key names (not value) associated to a lease when `Keys` parameter is true, even a user doesn't have read permission to the keys. The impact is limited to a cluster which enables auth (RBAC). Versions 3.4.26 and 3.5.9 fix this issue. There are no known workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a603c0798948941d453b158af794edab1a8230be"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.26"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd","events":[{"introduced":"946a5a6f25c3b6b89408ab447852731bde6e6289"},{"fixed":"bdbbde998b7ed434b23676530d10dbd601c4a7c0"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.5.0"},{"fixed":"3.5.9"}]}}],"versions":["0","api/v3.5.0","api/v3.5.1","api/v3.5.2","api/v3.5.3","api/v3.5.4","api/v3.5.5","api/v3.5.6","api/v3.5.7","api/v3.5.8","client/pkg/v3.5.0","client/pkg/v3.5.1","client/pkg/v3.5.2","client/pkg/v3.5.3","client/pkg/v3.5.4","client/pkg/v3.5.5","client/pkg/v3.5.6","client/pkg/v3.5.7","client/pkg/v3.5.8","client/v2.305.0","client/v2.305.1","client/v2.305.2","client/v2.305.3","client/v2.305.4","client/v2.305.5","client/v2.305.6","client/v2.305.7","client/v2.305.8","client/v3.5.0","client/v3.5.1","client/v3.5.2","client/v3.5.3","client/v3.5.4","client/v3.5.5","client/v3.5.6","client/v3.5.7","client/v3.5.8","etcdctl/v3.5.0","etcdctl/v3.5.1","etcdctl/v3.5.2","etcdctl/v3.5.3","etcdctl/v3.5.4","etcdctl/v3.5.5","etcdctl/v3.5.6","etcdctl/v3.5.7","etcdctl/v3.5.8","etcdutl/v3.5.0","etcdutl/v3.5.1","etcdutl/v3.5.2","etcdutl/v3.5.3","etcdutl/v3.5.4","etcdutl/v3.5.5","etcdutl/v3.5.6","etcdutl/v3.5.7","etcdutl/v3.5.8","pkg/v3.5.0","pkg/v3.5.1","pkg/v3.5.2","pkg/v3.5.3","pkg/v3.5.4","pkg/v3.5.5","pkg/v3.5.6","pkg/v3.5.7","pkg/v3.5.8","raft/v3.5.0","raft/v3.5.1","raft/v3.5.2","raft/v3.5.3","raft/v3.5.4","raft/v3.5.5","raft/v3.5.6","raft/v3.5.7","raft/v3.5.8","server/v3.5.0","server/v3.5.1","server/v3.5.2","server/v3.5.3","server/v3.5.4","server/v3.5.5","server/v3.5.6","server/v3.5.7","server/v3.5.8","tests/v3.5.0","tests/v3.5.1","tests/v3.5.2","tests/v3.5.3","tests/v3.5.4","tests/v3.5.5","tests/v3.5.6","tests/v3.5.7","tests/v3.5.8","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.2.0","v0.2.0-rc0","v0.2.0-rc1","v0.2.0-rc2","v0.2.0-rc3","v0.2.0-rc4","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.5.0-alpha.0","v0.5.0-alpha.1","v0.5.0-alpha.2","v0.5.0-alpha.3","v0.5.0-alpha.4","v0.5.0-alpha.5","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-rc.1","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-alpha.0","v2.1.0-alpha.1","v2.1.0-rc.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.0-alpha.0","v2.2.0-alpha.1","v2.2.0-rc.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.0-alpha.0","v2.3.0-alpha.1","v3.0.0-beta.0","v3.1.0-alpha.0","v3.1.0-alpha.1","v3.1.0-rc.0","v3.1.0-rc.1","v3.2.0+git","v3.2.0-rc.0","v3.2.0-rc.1","v3.2.0_plus_git","v3.2.10_plus_git","v3.3.0-rc.0","v3.3.9_plus_git","v3.4.0","v3.4.0-rc.0","v3.4.0-rc.1","v3.4.0-rc.2","v3.4.0-rc.3","v3.4.0-rc.4","v3.4.1","v3.4.10","v3.4.11","v3.4.12","v3.4.13","v3.4.14","v3.4.15","v3.4.16","v3.4.17","v3.4.18","v3.4.19","v3.4.2","v3.4.20","v3.4.21","v3.4.22","v3.4.23","v3.4.24","v3.4.25","v3.4.3","v3.4.4","v3.4.5","v3.4.6","v3.4.7","v3.4.8","v3.4.9","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.5.3","v3.5.4","v3.5.5","v3.5.6","v3.5.7","v3.5.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-32082.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.4.md"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.5.md"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/15656"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/security/advisories/GHSA-3p4g-rcw5-8298"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
