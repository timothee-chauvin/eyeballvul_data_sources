The flaw could be triggered by a crafted input file under certain conditions when processed by ImageMagick. Red Hat Product Security marked this as Low severity because although it could potentially lead to an impact to application availability, no specific impact was shown in this case. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/imagemagick/imagemagick6","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bcb26c8197b73657830415bf977fb1b066e88174"}]}],"versions":["6.9.10-0","6.9.10-1","6.9.10-10","6.9.10-11","6.9.10-12","6.9.10-13","6.9.10-14","6.9.10-15","6.9.10-16","6.9.10-17","6.9.10-18","6.9.10-19","6.9.10-2","6.9.10-20","6.9.10-21","6.9.10-22","6.9.10-23","6.9.10-24","6.9.10-25","6.9.10-26","6.9.10-27","6.9.10-28","6.9.10-29","6.9.10-3","6.9.10-30","6.9.10-31","6.9.10-32","6.9.10-33","6.9.10-34","6.9.10-35","6.9.10-36","6.9.10-37","6.9.10-38","6.9.10-39","6.9.10-4","6.9.10-40","6.9.10-41","6.9.10-42","6.9.10-43","6.9.10-44","6.9.10-45","6.9.10-46","6.9.10-47","6.9.10-48","6.9.10-49","6.9.10-5","6.9.10-50","6.9.10-51","6.9.10-52","6.9.10-53","6.9.10-54","6.9.10-55","6.9.10-56","6.9.10-57","6.9.10-58","6.9.10-59","6.9.10-6","6.9.10-60","6.9.10-61","6.9.10-62","6.9.10-63","6.9.10-64","6.9.10-65","6.9.10-66","6.9.10-67","6.9.10-7","6.9.10-8","6.9.10-9","6.9.4-0","6.9.4-1","6.9.4-10","6.9.4-2","6.9.4-3","6.9.4-4","6.9.4-5","6.9.4-6","6.9.4-7","6.9.4-8","6.9.4-9","6.9.5-0","6.9.5-1","6.9.5-10","6.9.5-2","6.9.5-3","6.9.5-4","6.9.5-5","6.9.5-6","6.9.5-7","6.9.5-8","6.9.5-9","6.9.6-0","6.9.6-1","6.9.6-2","6.9.6-3","6.9.6-4","6.9.6-5","6.9.6-6","6.9.6-7","6.9.6-8","6.9.7-0","6.9.7-1","6.9.7-10","6.9.7-2","6.9.7-3","6.9.7-4","6.9.7-5","6.9.7-6","6.9.7-7","6.9.7-8","6.9.7-9","6.9.8-0","6.9.8-1","6.9.8-10","6.9.8-2","6.9.8-3","6.9.8-4","6.9.8-5","6.9.8-6","6.9.8-7","6.9.8-8","6.9.8-9","6.9.9-0","6.9.9-1","6.9.9-10","6.9.9-11","6.9.9-12","6.9.9-13","6.9.9-14","6.9.9-15","6.9.9-17","6.9.9-18","6.9.9-19","6.9.9-2","6.9.9-20","6.9.9-21","6.9.9-22","6.9.9-23","6.9.9-24","6.9.9-25","6.9.9-26","6.9.9-27","6.9.9-28","6.9.9-29","6.9.9-3","6.9.9-30","6.9.9-31","6.9.9-32","6.9.9-33","6.9.9-34","6.9.9-35","6.9.9-36","6.9.9-37","6.9.9-38","6.9.9-39","6.9.9-4","6.9.9-40","6.9.9-41","6.9.9-42","6.9.9-43","6.9.9-44","6.9.9-45","6.9.9-46","6.9.9-47","6.9.9-48","6.9.9-49","6.9.9-5","6.9.9-50","6.9.9-51","6.9.9-6","6.9.9-7","6.9.9-8","6.9.9-9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-27759.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/imagemagick/imagemagick","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"cdfd76effab52bb2489feb6518178b66324dec11"}]}],"versions":["7.0.1-0","7.0.1-1","7.0.1-10","7.0.1-2","7.0.1-3","7.0.1-4","7.0.1-5","7.0.1-6","7.0.1-7","7.0.1-8","7.0.1-9","7.0.2-0","7.0.2-1","7.0.2-10","7.0.2-2","7.0.2-3","7.0.2-4","7.0.2-5","7.0.2-6","7.0.2-7","7.0.2-8","7.0.2-9","7.0.3-0","7.0.3-1","7.0.3-10","7.0.3-2","7.0.3-3","7.0.3-4","7.0.3-5","7.0.3-6","7.0.3-7","7.0.3-8","7.0.3-9","7.0.4-0","7.0.4-1","7.0.4-10","7.0.4-2","7.0.4-3","7.0.4-4","7.0.4-5","7.0.4-6","7.0.4-7","7.0.4-8","7.0.4-9","7.0.5-0","7.0.5-1","7.0.5-10","7.0.5-2","7.0.5-3","7.0.5-4","7.0.5-5","7.0.5-6","7.0.5-7","7.0.5-8","7.0.5-9","7.0.6-0","7.0.6-1","7.0.6-2","7.0.6-3","7.0.6-4","7.0.6-5","7.0.6-6","7.0.6-7","7.0.6-8","7.0.6-9","7.0.7-0","7.0.7-1","7.0.7-10","7.0.7-11","7.0.7-12","7.0.7-13","7.0.7-14","7.0.7-15","7.0.7-16","7.0.7-17","7.0.7-18","7.0.7-19","7.0.7-2","7.0.7-20","7.0.7-21","7.0.7-22","7.0.7-23","7.0.7-24","7.0.7-25","7.0.7-26","7.0.7-27","7.0.7-28","7.0.7-29","7.0.7-3","7.0.7-30","7.0.7-31","7.0.7-32","7.0.7-33","7.0.7-34","7.0.7-35","7.0.7-36","7.0.7-37","7.0.7-38","7.0.7-39","7.0.7-4","7.0.7-5","7.0.7-6","7.0.7-8","7.0.7-9","7.0.7.7","7.0.8-0","7.0.8-1","7.0.8-10","7.0.8-11","7.0.8-12","7.0.8-13","7.0.8-14","7.0.8-15","7.0.8-16","7.0.8-17","7.0.8-18","7.0.8-19","7.0.8-2","7.0.8-20","7.0.8-21","7.0.8-22","7.0.8-23","7.0.8-24","7.0.8-25","7.0.8-26","7.0.8-27","7.0.8-28","7.0.8-29","7.0.8-3","7.0.8-30","7.0.8-31","7.0.8-32","7.0.8-33","7.0.8-34","7.0.8-35","7.0.8-36","7.0.8-37","7.0.8-38","7.0.8-39","7.0.8-4","7.0.8-40","7.0.8-41","7.0.8-42","7.0.8-43","7.0.8-44","7.0.8-45","7.0.8-46","7.0.8-47","7.0.8-48","7.0.8-49","7.0.8-5","7.0.8-50","7.0.8-51","7.0.8-52","7.0.8-53","7.0.8-54","7.0.8-55","7.0.8-56","7.0.8-57","7.0.8-58","7.0.8-59","7.0.8-6","7.0.8-60","7.0.8-61","7.0.8-62","7.0.8-63","7.0.8-64","7.0.8-65","7.0.8-66","7.0.8-67","7.0.8-7","7.0.8-8","7.0.8-9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-27759.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1894238"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00030.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/03/msg00008.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
