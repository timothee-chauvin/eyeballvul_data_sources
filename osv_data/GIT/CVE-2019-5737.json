This keeps the connection and associated resources alive for a long period of time. Potential attacks are mitigated by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer. This vulnerability is an extension of CVE-2018-12121, addressed in November and impacts all active Node.js release lines including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nodejs/node","events":[{"introduced":"ce3e3c5fe15479475c068482c48eb9cbf1ac9df5"},{"fixed":"e6a25300148c32872d6701dfa25c1210797beb4b"}]}],"versions":["v6.0.0","v6.1.0","v6.10.0","v6.10.1","v6.10.2","v6.10.3","v6.11.0","v6.11.1","v6.11.2","v6.11.3","v6.11.4","v6.11.5","v6.12.0","v6.12.1","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.13.0","v6.13.1","v6.14.0","v6.14.1","v6.14.2","v6.14.3","v6.14.4","v6.15.0","v6.15.1","v6.16.0","v6.2.0","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.3.0","v6.3.1","v6.4.0","v6.5.0","v6.6.0","v6.7.0","v6.8.0","v6.8.1","v6.9.0","v6.9.1","v6.9.2","v6.9.3","v6.9.4","v6.9.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-5737.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-03/msg00041.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00046.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00059.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1821"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2019-security-releases/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-48"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190502-0008/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
