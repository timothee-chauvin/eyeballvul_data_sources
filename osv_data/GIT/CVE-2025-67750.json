Versions 6.10.5 and below allow a maliciously crafted flow metadata file to cause arbitrary JavaScript execution during scanning. The APIVersion rule uses new Function() to evaluate expression strings, enabling an attacker to supply a malicious expression within rule configuration or crafted flow metadata. This could compromise developer machines, CI runners, or editor environments. This issue is fixed in version 6.10.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/flow-scanner/lightning-flow-scanner","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b522b476c153c9acc2bdf765f9491dbeabe3d4b4"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.3.0","2.10","2.11","2.14","2.15","2.16","2.17","2.18","2.19","2.20","2.21","2.22","2.23","2.24","2.25","2.26","2.27","2.28","2.3","2.30","2.4","2.5","2.6","2.7","2.8","2.9","3.0.0","3.10","3.11","3.12","3.16","3.17","3.17.1","3.17.2-prerelease.1","3.8","3.8.0","3.9","action-v2.3.0","action-v2.4.0","action-v2.5.0","action-v2.6.0","core-v6.10.0","core-v6.10.1","core-v6.10.2","core-v6.10.3","core-v6.10.4","core-v6.10.5","core-v6.6.1","core-v6.6.3","core-v6.6.5","core-v6.7.0","core-v6.8.0","core-v6.8.1","v.1.11.0","v1.10.0","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.11.4","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.13.3","v1.13.4","v1.13.5","v1.4.0","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.8.5","v1.8.6","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.12.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.26.0","v2.26.1","v2.26.2","v2.27.0","v2.27.1","v2.27.2","v2.27.3","v2.28.0","v2.28.1","v2.28.2","v2.28.3","v2.29.0","v2.29.1","v2.31.0","v2.31.1","v2.31.2","v2.31.3","v2.31.4","v2.31.5","v2.31.6","v2.31.7","v2.31.8","v2.32.0","v2.32.1","v2.32.2","v2.32.3","v2.33.0","v2.33.1","v2.34.0","v2.34.1","v2.34.2","v2.35.0","v2.35.1","v2.36.0","v2.36.1","v2.37.0","v2.37.1","v2.38.0","v2.38.1","v2.39.0","v2.39.1","v2.40.0","v2.40.1","v2.40.2","v2.41.0","v2.41.1","v2.42.0","v2.42.1","v2.43.0","v2.43.1","v2.44.0","v2.44.1","v2.45.0","v2.45.1","v2.46.0","v2.46.1","v2.46.2","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.10.0","v3.10.1","v3.11.0","v3.11.1","v3.12.0","v3.12.1","v3.13.0","v3.13.1","v3.14.0","v3.14.1","v3.15.0","v3.15.1","v3.16.0","v3.16.1","v3.17.0","v3.17.1","v3.17.2","v3.17.2-prerelease","v3.17.3","v3.17.4","v3.17.5","v3.18.0","v3.18.1","v3.18.2","v3.18.3","v3.18.4","v3.18.5","v3.19.0","v3.19.1","v3.19.2","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.20.0","v3.20.1","v3.20.2","v3.20.3","v3.20.4","v3.20.5","v3.20.6","v3.21.0","v3.21.1","v3.21.2","v3.21.3","v3.21.4","v3.21.5","v3.22.0","v3.22.1","v3.22.10","v3.22.11","v3.22.12","v3.22.13","v3.22.14","v3.22.15","v3.22.16","v3.22.17","v3.22.18","v3.22.19","v3.22.2","v3.22.3","v3.22.4","v3.22.5","v3.22.6","v3.22.7","v3.22.8","v3.22.9","v3.23.0","v3.23.1","v3.24.0","v3.24.1","v3.25.0","v3.25.1","v3.26.0","v3.26.1","v3.27.0","v3.27.1","v3.28.0","v3.28.1","v3.29.0","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.9.0","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.10.0","v4.10.1","v4.10.2","v4.11.0","v4.11.1","v4.11.2","v4.11.3","v4.11.4","v4.11.5","v4.11.6","v4.11.7","v4.11.8","v4.11.9","v4.12.0","v4.12.1","v4.12.2","v4.12.3","v4.13.0","v4.13.1","v4.13.10","v4.13.11","v4.13.2","v4.13.3","v4.13.4","v4.13.5","v4.13.6","v4.13.7","v4.13.8","v4.13.9","v4.14.0","v4.14.1","v4.15.0","v4.15.1","v4.16.0","v4.16.1","v4.16.2","v4.16.3","v4.17.0","v4.18.0","v4.18.1","v4.18.2","v4.18.3","v4.18.4","v4.18.5","v4.19.0","v4.19.1","v4.19.2","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.20.0","v4.20.1","v4.21.0","v4.21.1","v4.21.2","v4.22.0","v4.22.1","v4.22.2","v4.22.3","v4.22.4","v4.22.5","v4.22.6","v4.22.7","v4.23.0","v4.23.1","v4.24.0","v4.24.1","v4.24.2","v4.25.0","v4.25.1","v4.26.0","v4.26.1","v4.26.2","v4.26.3","v4.27.0","v4.27.1","v4.28.0","v4.28.1","v4.28.2","v4.28.3","v4.29.0","v4.29.1","v4.29.2","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.30.0","v4.30.1","v4.30.2","v4.31.0","v4.31.1","v4.31.2","v4.31.3","v4.32.0","v4.32.1","v4.32.2","v4.32.3","v4.32.4","v4.32.5","v4.32.6","v4.32.7","v4.33.0","v4.33.1","v4.34.0","v4.34.1","v4.35.0","v4.35.1","v4.35.2","v4.35.3","v4.35.4","v4.35.5","v4.36.0","v4.36.1","v4.36.2","v4.37.0","v4.37.1","v4.37.2","v4.37.3","v4.38.0","v4.38.1","v4.38.2","v4.39.0","v4.39.1","v4.39.2","v4.39.3","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.40.0","v4.40.1","v4.40.2","v4.41.0","v4.41.1","v4.42.0","v4.42.1","v4.43.0","v4.43.1","v4.43.2","v4.43.3","v4.43.4","v4.43.5","v4.43.6","v4.43.7","v4.44.0","v4.44.1","v4.44.2","v4.45.0","v4.45.1","v4.45.2","v4.45.3","v4.45.4","v4.46.0","v4.46.1","v4.46.2","v4.46.3","v4.47.0","v4.47.1","v4.47.2","v4.48.0","v4.48.1","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.5.2","v4.5.3","v4.6.0","v4.6.1","v4.7.0","v4.7.1","v4.8.0","v4.8.1","v4.9.0","v4.9.1","v4.9.2","v5.0.0","v5.0.1","v5.1.0","v5.2.0","v5.3.0","v5.4.0","v5.5.0","v5.7.0","v5.8.0","v5.8.1","v5.8.2","v5.9.0","v5.9.2","v5.9.3","v5.9.4","v5.9.6","v6.0.0","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.1.0","v6.1.1","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4","v6.2.5","v6.2.6","v6.2.7","v6.3.0","v6.3.1","v6.4.0","v6.4.1","v6.4.2","v6.4.3","v6.5.0","v6.5.1","v6.6.0","v6.6.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67750.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67750.json"},{"type":"FIX
