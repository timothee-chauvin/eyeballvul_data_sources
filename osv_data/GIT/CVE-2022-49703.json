The value is available when a\nqueue is first allocated and can/should be also set for primary and async\nqueues as well as subcrqs.\n\nThis fixes a crash observed during kexec/kdump on Power 9 with legacy XICS\ninterrupt controller where a pending subcrq interrupt from the previous\nkernel can be replayed immediately upon IRQ registration resulting in\ndereference of a garbage backpointer in ibmvfc_interrupt_scsi().\n\nKernel attempted to read user page (58) - exploit attempt?
