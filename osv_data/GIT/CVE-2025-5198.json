The only known potential exploit is if the script is included in the name of a Kubernetes “Role” object* that is applied to a secured cluster. This object can be used by a user with access to the cluster or through a compromised third-party product.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"63fce4eb4d89f3a88734d1950a128a02b0abcf74"}]}],"versions":["3.65.x","3.67.x","3.68.x","3.69.x","3.70.x","3.71.x","3.72.x","3.73.x","3.74.x","4.0.x"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-5198.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-5198"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2368568"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/pull/13336"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
