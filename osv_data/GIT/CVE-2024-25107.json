{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-25107","published":"2024-02-08T22:46:39.144Z","modified":"2025-11-19T02:35:34.719479Z","aliases":["GHSA-cfcf-94jv-455f"],"summary":"Cross-Site Scripting in WikiDiscover","details":"WikiDiscover is an extension designed for use with a CreateWiki managed farm to display wikis. On Special:WikiDiscover, the `Language::date` function is used when making the human-readable timestamp for inclusion on the wiki_creation column. This function uses interface messages to translate the names of months and days. It uses the `->text()` output mode, returning unescaped interface messages. Since the output is not escaped later, the unescaped interface message is included on the output, resulting in an XSS vulnerability. Exploiting this on-wiki requires the `(editinterface)` right. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `267e763a0`. Users are advised to update their installations. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/miraheze/wikidiscover","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"267e763a0d7460f001693c42f67717a0fc3fd6bb"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-25107.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/commit/267e763a0d7460f001693c42f67717a0fc3fd6bb"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/security/advisories/GHSA-cfcf-94jv-455f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/T11814"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
