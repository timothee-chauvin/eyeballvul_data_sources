Starting in version 0.3.4 and prior to version 1.0.5, running goshs without arguments makes it possible for anyone to execute commands on the server. The function `dispatchReadPump` does not checks the option cli `-c`, thus allowing anyone to execute arbitrary command through the use of websockets. Version 1.0.5 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/patrickhener/goshs","events":[{"introduced":"188589596594765ad4b22d2709fc5ca848c6a56a"},{"fixed":"1eb190b81f7a7d8bbb94387c3d192a0dfa420e87"}]}],"versions":["v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.3.8","v0.3.9","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-46816.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/46xxx/CVE-2025-46816.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/patrickhener/goshs/commit/160220974576afe5111485b8d12fd36058984cfa"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/patrickhener/goshs/security/advisories/GHSA-rwj2-w85g-5cmm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46816"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-284","CWE-77"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/46xxx/CVE-2025-46816.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
