An internal security review identified an unauthorized file disclosure vulnerability. It is possible for a malicious user to retrieve unauthorized files under some network conditions or via a fake datasource (if user has admin permissions in Grafana). All Grafana installations should be upgraded to version 3.6.1 as soon as possible. As a workaround it is possible to [disable HTTP remote rendering](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#plugingrafana-image-renderer).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana-image-renderer","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d9fc4696a6a1ec24500cdb320c2bfedf828eae5d"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31176.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana-image-renderer/security/advisories/GHSA-2cfh-233g-m4c5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221209-0004/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana-image-renderer/pull/364"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H"}]}
