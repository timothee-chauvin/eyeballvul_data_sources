And store_trace_args() won't check\nwhether these data exceeds a single page or not, caused out-of-bounds\nmemory access.\n\nIt could be reproduced by following steps:\n1. build kernel with CONFIG_KASAN enabled\n2. save follow program as test.c\n\n```\n\\#include <stdio.h>\n\\#include <stdlib.h>\n\\#include <string.h>\n\n// If string length large than MAX_STRING_SIZE, the fetch_store_strlen()\n// will return 0, cause __get_data_size() return shorter size, and\n// store_trace_args() will not trigger out-of-bounds access.\n// So make string length less than 4096.\n\\#define STRLEN 4093\n\nvoid generate_string(char *str, int n)\n{\n    int i;\n    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)\n    {\n        char c = i % 26 + 'a';\n        str[i] = c;\n    }\n    str[n-1] = '\\0';\n}\n\nvoid print_string(char *str)\n{\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", str);\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    char tmp[STRLEN];\n\n    generate_string(tmp, STRLEN);\n    print_string(tmp);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n3. compile program\n`gcc -o test test.c`\n\n4. get the offset of `print_string()`\n```\nobjdump -t test | grep -w print_string\n0000000000401199 g     F .text  000000000000001b              print_string\n```\n\n5. configure uprobe with offset 0x1199\n```\noff=0x1199\n\ncd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/\necho \"p /root/test:${off} arg1=+0(%di):ustring arg2=\\$comm arg3=+0(%di):ustring\"\n > uprobe_events\necho 1 > events/uprobes/enable\necho 1 > tracing_on\n```\n\n6. run `test`, and kasan will report error.\n==================================================================\nBUG: KASAN:
