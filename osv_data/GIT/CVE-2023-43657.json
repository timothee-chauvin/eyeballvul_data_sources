Improper escaping of encrypted topic titles could lead to a cross site scripting (XSS) issue when a site has content security policy (CSP) headers disabled. Having CSP disabled is a non-default configuration, and having it disabled with discourse-encrypt installed will result in a warning in the Discourse admin dashboard. This has been fixed in commit `9c75810af9` which is included in the latest version of the discourse-encrypt plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that CSP headers are enabled and properly configured.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-encrypt","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9c75810af9a474d7edaec67dea66f852c0ba1f4e"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-43657.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/43xxx/CVE-2023-43657.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-encrypt/commit/9c75810af9a474d7edaec67dea66f852c0ba1f4e"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-encrypt/security/advisories/GHSA-5fh6-wp7p-xx7v"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43657"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/43xxx/CVE-2023-43657.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
