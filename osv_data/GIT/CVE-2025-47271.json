In versions 1.13.2 through 1.13.5, potentially untrusted data flows into PR creation logic. A malicious actor could construct a branch name that injects arbitrary code. This is patched in 1.13.6. As a workaround, one may downgrade to a version prior to 1.13.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ozi-project/publish","events":[{"introduced":"32e7c7b76d44a458dc7538ddc1645520185aa391"},{"fixed":"d1763d63541169af7572fbe3c3b6ea9ffc2d355c"}]}],"versions":["1.13.2","1.13.3","1.13.4","1.13.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-47271.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OZI-Project/publish/commit/abd8524ec69800890529846b3ccfb09ce7c10b5c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OZI-Project/publish/security/advisories/GHSA-2487-9f55-2vg9"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1116","CWE-94","CWE-95"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
