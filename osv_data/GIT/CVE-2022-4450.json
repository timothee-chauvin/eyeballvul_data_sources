The\ncaller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a\nPEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex()\nwill return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer\nto a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer\nthen a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This\ncould be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM\nfiles for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.\n\nThe functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around\nPEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.\n\nThese functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL\nfunctions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and\nSSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal\nuses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the\nheader argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations\ninclude the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in\nOpenSSL 3.0.\n\nThe OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openssl/openssl","events":[{"introduced":"89cd17a031e022211684eb7eb41190cf1910f9fa"},{"fixed":"31157bc0b46e04227b8468d3e6915e4d0332777c"}]}],"versions":["openssl-3.0.0","openssl-3.0.1","openssl-3.0.2","openssl-3.0.3","openssl-3.0.4","openssl-3.0.5","openssl-3.0.6","openssl-3.0.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-4450.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0003"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=63bcf189be73a9cc1264059bed6f57974be74a83"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=bbcf509bd046b34cca19c766bbddc31683d0858b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
