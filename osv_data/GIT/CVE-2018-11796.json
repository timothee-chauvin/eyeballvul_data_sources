{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2018-11796","published":"2018-10-09T22:29:00.393Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:34:34.940737Z","aliases":["GHSA-h8q5-g2cj-qr5h"],"details":"In Apache Tika 1.19 (CVE-2018-11761), we added an entity expansion limit for XML parsing. However, Tika reuses SAXParsers and calls reset() after each parse, which, for Xerces2 parsers, as per the documentation, removes the user-specified SecurityManager and thus removes entity expansion limits after the first parse. Apache Tika versions from 0.1 to 1.19 are therefore still vulnerable to entity expansions which can lead to a denial of service attack. Users should upgrade to 1.19.1 or later.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/tika","events":[{"introduced":"fe7399ebe5f1d2cca553252577d0925815072b21"},{"last_affected":"199112bde63e64af3de7ec8c98475907e7513128"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-11796.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/88de8350cda9b184888ec294c813c5bd8a2081de8fd3666f8904bc05%40%3Cdev.tika.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105585"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3892"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190903-0002/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
