The vulnerability is due to inefficient MIME parsing routines that result in extremely long scan times of specially formatted email files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to scan the crafted email file indefinitely, resulting in a denial of service condition.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cisco-talos/clamav","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"8925c55dfc6f34e7667a0afa65fdc2f5a558be3e"},{"last_affected":"8efadbbb69303a35871c8a9ac376f64e1fb1abf8"}]}],"versions":["clamav-0.101.0","clamav-0.101.1","clamav-0.101.2","clamav-0.101.3","clamav-0.101.4","clamav-0.102.0","clamav-0.96","clamav-0.96.2","clamav-0.96.3","clamav-0.96.4","clamav-0.96.5","clamav-0.96rc1","clamav-0.96rc2","clamav-0.97","clamav-0.97rc","clamav-0.98-dmgxar","clamav-0.99-beta1","merge-llvm-79908","merge-llvm-80601","merge-llvm-83242","merge-llvm-90002","merge-llvm-91214","merge-llvm-91428","merge-llvm-92222","merge-llvm-94539","merge-llvm-97877","r5076"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-15961.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=12380"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/02/msg00016.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://quickview.cloudapps.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCvr56010"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-46"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4230-2/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
