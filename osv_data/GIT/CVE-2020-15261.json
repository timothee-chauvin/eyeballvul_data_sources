Since Veyon users (both students and teachers) usually don't have administrative privileges, this vulnerability is only dangerous in anyway unsafe setups. The problem has been fixed in version 4.4.2. As a workaround, the exploitation of the vulnerability can be prevented by revoking administrative privileges from all potentially untrustworthy users.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/veyon/veyon","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f231ec511b9a09f43f49b2c7bb7c60b8046276b1"}]}],"versions":["v3.99.0","v3.99.1","v3.99.2","v3.99.3","v3.99.4","v3.99.5","v3.99.6","v3.99.7","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.5","v4.0.90","v4.0.91","v4.0.92","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.1.3","v4.1.4","v4.1.90","v4.1.91","v4.1.92","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.2.3","v4.99.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-15261.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["272118001296872365787519925518929597588","275342087029539659717202817469162695245","163600722140506002111636782884147320458","118613466315895221819147265198958329498","160732023610005516958705917526652610159","24231635469766302601441547201643366241","256975937652514861376594475042041235699","258769395570646887833924535121040133852"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2020-15261-1e952060","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/veyon/veyon/commit/f231ec511b9a09f43f49b2c7bb7c60b8046276b1","target":{"file":"plugins/platform/windows/WindowsServiceControl.cpp"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"290294997321056731839350118888527666391","length":1219},"id":"CVE-2020-15261-472fe8e6","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/veyon/veyon/commit/f231ec511b9a09f43f49b2c7bb7c60b8046276b1","target":{"file":"plugins/platform/windows/WindowsServiceControl.cpp","function":"WindowsServiceControl::install"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162873/Veyon-4.4.1-Unquoted-Service-Path.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/veyon/veyon/commit/f231ec511b9a09f43f49b2c7bb7c60b8046276b1"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/veyon/veyon/issues/657"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/veyon/veyon/security/advisories/GHSA-c8cc-x786-hqqp"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48246"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49925"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
