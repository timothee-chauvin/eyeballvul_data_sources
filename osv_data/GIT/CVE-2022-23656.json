An attacker could maliciously craft a full name for their account and send messages to a topic with several participants; a victim who then opens an overflow tooltip including this full name on the recent topics page could trigger execution of JavaScript code controlled by the attacker. Users running a Zulip server from the main branch should upgrade from main (2022-03-01 or later) again to deploy this fix.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e090027adcbf62737d5b1f83a9618a9500a49321"}]}],"versions":["1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.10","1.3.11","1.3.12","1.3.13","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.5","1.3.6","1.3.7","1.3.8","1.3.9","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.6.0","1.7.0","1.8.0","1.8.0-rc1","1.9.0","1.9.0-rc2","1.9.0-rc3","2.0.0","2.0.0-rc1","2.1-dev","2.1.0","2.1.0-rc1","2.2-dev","3.0","3.0-dev","3.0-rc1","3.0-rc2","4.0","4.0-dev","5.0-dev","enterprise-1.1.5","enterprise-1.2.0","shared-0.0.1","shared-0.0.2","shared-0.0.3","shared-0.0.4","shared-0.0.5","shared-0.0.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23656.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-fc77-h3jc-6mfv"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/e090027adcbf62737d5b1f83a9618a9500a49321"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
