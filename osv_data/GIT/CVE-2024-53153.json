{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-53153","published":"2024-12-24T11:28:52.518Z","modified":"2025-12-05T07:37:30.810455Z","related":["USN-7276-1","USN-7277-1"],"summary":"PCI: qcom-ep: Move controller cleanups to qcom_pcie_perst_deassert()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: qcom-ep: Move controller cleanups to qcom_pcie_perst_deassert()\n\nCurrently, the endpoint cleanup function dw_pcie_ep_cleanup() and EPF\ndeinit notify function pci_epc_deinit_notify() are called during the\nexecution of qcom_pcie_perst_assert() i.e., when the host has asserted\nPERST#. But quickly after this step, refclk will also be disabled by the\nhost.\n\nAll of the Qcom endpoint SoCs supported as of now depend on the refclk from\nthe host for keeping the controller operational. Due to this limitation,\nany access to the hardware registers in the absence of refclk will result\nin a whole endpoint crash. Unfortunately, most of the controller cleanups\nrequire accessing the hardware registers (like eDMA cleanup performed in\ndw_pcie_ep_cleanup(), powering down MHI EPF etc...). So these cleanup\nfunctions are currently causing the crash in the endpoint SoC once host\nasserts PERST#.\n\nOne way to address this issue is by generating the refclk in the endpoint\nitself and not depending on the host. But that is not always possible as\nsome of the endpoint designs do require the endpoint to consume refclk from\nthe host (as I was told by the Qcom engineers).\n\nThus, fix this crash by moving the controller cleanups to the start of\nthe qcom_pcie_perst_deassert() function. qcom_pcie_perst_deassert() is\ncalled whenever the host has deasserted PERST# and it is guaranteed that\nthe refclk would be active at this point. So at the start of this function\n(after enabling resources), the controller cleanup can be performed. Once\nfinished, rest of the code execution for PERST# deassert can continue as\nusual.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"570d7715eed8a29ac5bd96c7694f060a991e5a31"},{"fixed":"e03b5f1615c84f4139cb53ef8659f4cdb8d6a563"},{"fixed":"516969d5765e2302d33b4f251496eedb757d55ea"},{"fixed":"7d7cf89b119af433354f865fc01017b9f8aa411a"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.11.1","v6.11.10","v6.11.2","v6.11.3","v6.11.4","v6.11.5","v6.11.6","v6.11.7","v6.11.8","v6.11.9","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.9","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-53153.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.10.0"},{"fixed":"6.11.11"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-53153.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/516969d5765e2302d33b4f251496eedb757d55ea"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7d7cf89b119af433354f865fc01017b9f8aa411a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e03b5f1615c84f4139cb53ef8659f4cdb8d6a563"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/53xxx/CVE-2024-53153.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53153"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/53xxx/CVE-2024-53153.json"}}
