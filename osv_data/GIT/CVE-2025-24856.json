  "details": "An issue was discovered in the oidc (aka OpenID Connect Authentication) extension before 4.0.0 for TYPO3. The account linking logic allows a pre-hijacking attack, leading to Account Takeover. The attack can only be exploited if the following requirements are met: (1) an attacker can anticipate the e-mail address of the user, (2) an attacker can register a public frontend user account using that e-mail address before the user's first OIDC login, and (3) the IDP returns an email field containing the e-mail address of the user,",
