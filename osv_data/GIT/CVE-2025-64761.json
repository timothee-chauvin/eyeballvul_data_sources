{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-64761","published":"2025-11-25T00:01:17.986Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:21:50.413961Z","aliases":["GHSA-7ff4-jw48-3436","GO-2025-4156"],"summary":"OpenBao Privileged Operator Identity Group Root Escalation","details":"OpenBao is an open source identity-based secrets management system. Prior to version 2.4.4, a privileged operator could use the identity group subsystem to add a root policy to a group identity group, escalating their or another user's permissions in the system. Specifically this is an issue when: an operator in the root namespace has access to identity/groups endpoints and an operator does not have policy access. Otherwise, an operator with policy access could create or modify an existing policy to grant root-equivalent permissions through the sudo capability. This issue has been patched in version 2.4.4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openbao/openbao","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4bfd70723d4f9b82be00e87b8c018ac661dd9b99"}]}],"versions":["api/auth/approle/v0.1.0","api/auth/approle/v0.1.1","api/auth/approle/v0.2.0","api/auth/approle/v0.3.0","api/auth/approle/v0.4.0","api/auth/approle/v0.4.1","api/auth/approle/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/approle/v2.0.1","api/auth/approle/v2.2.0","api/auth/approle/v2.3.0","api/auth/approle/v2.4.0","api/auth/aws/v0.1.0","api/auth/aws/v0.2.0","api/auth/aws/v0.3.0","api/auth/aws/v0.4.0","api/auth/aws/v0.4.1","api/auth/aws/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/azure/v0.1.0","api/auth/azure/v0.2.0","api/auth/azure/v0.3.0","api/auth/azure/v0.4.0","api/auth/azure/v0.4.1","api/auth/azure/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/gcp/v0.1.0","api/auth/gcp/v0.2.0","api/auth/gcp/v0.3.0","api/auth/gcp/v0.4.0","api/auth/gcp/v0.4.1","api/auth/gcp/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/jwt/v2.4.0","api/auth/kubernetes/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/kubernetes/v2.0.1","api/auth/kubernetes/v2.2.0","api/auth/kubernetes/v2.3.0","api/auth/kubernetes/v2.4.0","api/auth/ldap/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/ldap/v2.0.1","api/auth/ldap/v2.2.0","api/auth/ldap/v2.3.0","api/auth/ldap/v2.4.0","api/auth/userpass/v0.1.0","api/auth/userpass/v0.2.0","api/auth/userpass/v0.3.0","api/auth/userpass/v0.4.0","api/auth/userpass/v0.4.1","api/auth/userpass/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/userpass/v2.0.1","api/auth/userpass/v2.2.0","api/auth/userpass/v2.3.0","api/auth/userpass/v2.4.0","api/v1.0.1","api/v1.0.2","api/v1.0.3","api/v1.0.4","api/v1.1.1","api/v1.100.0-development20240408","api/v1.2.0","api/v1.3.1","api/v1.5.0","api/v1.6.0","api/v1.7.0","api/v1.7.1","api/v1.7.2","api/v1.8.0","api/v1.8.1","api/v1.8.2","api/v1.8.3","api/v1.9.0","api/v1.9.1","api/v1.9.2","api/v2.0.1","api/v2.1.0","api/v2.2.0","api/v2.3.0","api/v2.4.0","before-plugin-removal","dev-namespaces-base-20250215","dev-namespaces-base-20250311","dev-namespaces-base-20250424","fork-point","sdk/v0.1.10","sdk/v0.1.11","sdk/v0.1.12","sdk/v0.1.13","sdk/v0.1.8","sdk/v0.1.9","sdk/v0.2.1","sdk/v0.3.0","sdk/v0.4.1","sdk/v0.5.0","sdk/v0.5.1","sdk/v0.5.3","sdk/v0.6.0","sdk/v0.6.1","sdk/v0.6.2","sdk/v0.7.0","sdk/v0.8.0","sdk/v0.9.0","sdk/v0.9.1","sdk/v1.100.0-development20240408","sdk/v2.0.1","sdk/v2.1.0","sdk/v2.2.0","sdk/v2.3.0","sdk/v2.4.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha20240329","v2.0.0-beta20240618","v2.1.0-beta20241114","v2.1.0-beta20241114.1","v2.1.0-beta20241114.2","v2.1.0-beta20241114.3","v2.2.0-beta20250213","v2.3.0-beta20250528","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64761.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64761.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/openbao/openbao/commit/16bb0ccd37a502930a289d434cbe4e7b4edd66e5"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/2143"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/openbao/openbao/security/advisories/GHSA-7ff4-jw48-3436"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64761"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-266"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64761.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
