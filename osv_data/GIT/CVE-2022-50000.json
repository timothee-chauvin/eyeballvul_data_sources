{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-50000","published":"2025-06-18T11:00:59.959Z","modified":"2025-12-04T18:59:37.496515Z","summary":"netfilter: flowtable: fix stuck flows on cleanup due to pending work","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: flowtable: fix stuck flows on cleanup due to pending work\n\nTo clear the flow table on flow table free, the following sequence\nnormally happens in order:\n\n  1) gc_step work is stopped to disable any further stats/del requests.\n  2) All flow table entries are set to teardown state.\n  3) Run gc_step which will queue HW del work for each flow table entry.\n  4) Waiting for the above del work to finish (flush).\n  5) Run gc_step again, deleting all entries from the flow table.\n  6) Flow table is freed.\n\nBut if a flow table entry already has pending HW stats or HW add work\nstep 3 will not queue HW del work (it will be skipped), step 4 will wait\nfor the pending add/stats to finish, and step 5 will queue HW del work\nwhich might execute after freeing of the flow table.\n\nTo fix the above, this patch flushes the pending work, then it sets the\nteardown flag to all flows in the flowtable and it forces a garbage\ncollector run to queue work to remove the flows from hardware, then it\nflushes this new pending work and (finally) it forces another garbage\ncollector run to remove the entry from the software flowtable.\n\nStack trace:\n[47773.882335] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in down_read+0x99/0x460\n[47773.883634] Write of size 8 at addr ffff888103b45aa8 by task
