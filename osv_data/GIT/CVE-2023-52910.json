The value of iovad->anchor.pfn_hi is ~0UL, then when\niovad->cached_node is iovad->anchor, curr_iova->pfn_hi + 1 will\noverflow. As a result, if the retry logic is executed, low_pfn is\nupdated to 0, and then new_pfn < low_pfn returns false to make the\nallocation successful.\n\nThis issue occurs in the following two situations:\n1. The first iova size exceeds the domain size. When initializing\niova domain, iovad->cached_node is assigned as iovad->anchor. For\nexample, the iova domain size is 10M, start_pfn is 0x1_F000_0000,\nand the iova size allocated for the first time is 11M. The\nfollowing is the log information, new->pfn_lo is smaller than\niovad->cached_node.\n\nExample log as follows:\n[  223.798112][T1705487] sh: [name:iova&]__alloc_and_insert_iova_range\nstart_pfn:0x1f0000,retry_pfn:0x0,size:0xb00,limit_pfn:0x1f0a00\n[  223.799590][T1705487] sh: [name:iova&]__alloc_and_insert_iova_range\nsuccess start_pfn:0x1f0000,new->pfn_lo:0x1efe00,new->pfn_hi:0x1f08ff\n\n2. The node with the largest iova->pfn_lo value in the iova domain\nis deleted, iovad->cached_node will be updated to iovad->anchor,\nand then the alloc iova size exceeds the maximum iova size that can\nbe allocated in the domain.\n\nAfter judging that retry_pfn is less than limit_pfn, call retry_pfn+1\nto fix the overflow issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"4e89dce725213d3d0b0475211b500eda4ef4bf2f"},{"fixed":"c929a230c84441e400c32e7b7b4ab763711fb63e"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"4e89dce725213d3d0b0475211b500eda4ef4bf2f"},{"fixed":"61cbf790e7329ed78877560be7136f0b911bba7f"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"4e89dce725213d3d0b0475211b500eda4ef4bf2f"},{"fixed":"dcdb3ba7e2a8caae7bfefd603bc22fd0ce9a389c"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-52910.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["331164490737932709382738841840521743503","322655481134782513609083394469988925505","145750324126279323683101160982625507634","124654522755374146576810599641428743720","164667092978119551462418122788380532543","15771048002945246829079537686861749785","220553932879020379632469381425892427338","122006965820738957210256782391771237025"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2023-52910-02eec103","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git@61cbf790e7329ed78877560be7136f0b911bba7f","target":{"file":"drivers/iommu/iova.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["331164490737932709382738841840521743503","322655481134782513609083394469988925505","145750324126279323683101160982625507634","124654522755374146576810599641428743720","164667092978119551462418122788380532543","15771048002945246829079537686861749785","220553932879020379632469381425892427338","122006965820738957210256782391771237025"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2023-52910-67e10570","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git@dcdb3ba7e2a8caae7bfefd603bc22fd0ce9a389c","target":{"file":"drivers/iommu/iova.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["331164490737932709382738841840521743503","322655481134782513609083394469988925505","145750324126279323683101160982625507634","124654522755374146576810599641428743720","164667092978119551462418122788380532543","15771048002945246829079537686861749785","220553932879020379632469381425892427338","122006965820738957210256782391771237025"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2023-52910-731263b0","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git@c929a230c84441e400c32e7b7b4ab763711fb63e","target":{"file":"drivers/iommu/iova.c"}}]}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introdu
