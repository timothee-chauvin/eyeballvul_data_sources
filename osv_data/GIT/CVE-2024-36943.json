Since\nptep_modify_prot_start() gets and clears atomically, the following is the\ncorrect pattern and prevents any possible race.  Any access after the\nfirst call would see an invalid pte and cause a fault:\n\n  pte = ptep_modify_prot_start(ptep);\n  pte = pte_mkuffd_wp(pte);\n  ptep_modify_prot_commit(ptep, pte);","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"52526ca7fdb905a768a93f8faa418e9b988fc34b"},{"fixed":"74b3d66f91d9f539f99faad74d796fa9a389a015"},{"fixed":"c70dce4982ce1718bf978a35f8e26160b82081f4"}]}],"versions":["v6.6","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.8.1","v6.8.2","v6.8.3","v6.8.4","v6.8.5","v6.8.6","v6.8.7","v6.8.8","v6.8.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-36943.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.8.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-36943.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/74b3d66f91d9f539f99faad74d796fa9a389a015"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c70dce4982ce1718bf978a35f8e26160b82081f4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/36xxx/CVE-2024-36943.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36943"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/36xxx/CVE-2024-36943.json"}}
