The django_ses library implements a mail backend for Django using AWS Simple Email Service. The library exports the `SESEventWebhookView class` intended to receive signed requests from AWS to handle email bounces, subscriptions, etc. These requests are signed by AWS and are verified by django_ses, however the verification of this signature was found to be flawed as it allowed users to specify arbitrary public certificates. This issue was patched in version 3.5.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/django-ses/django-ses","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2388f4b8c644ae8d26e5457af00e2974a17d0995"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-33185.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/33xxx/CVE-2023-33185.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/django-ses/django-ses/blob/3d627067935876487f9938310d5e1fbb249a7778/CVE/001-cert-url-signature-verification.md"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/django-ses/django-ses/commit/b71b5f413293a13997b6e6314086cb9c22629795"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/django-ses/django-ses/security/advisories/GHSA-qg36-9jxh-fj25"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33185"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-347"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/33xxx/CVE-2023-33185.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
