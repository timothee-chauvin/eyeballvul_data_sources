In versions up to and including 18.26.2, between 20.00.0 and 20.15.0, 20.7-cert6, 21.00.0, 22.00.0 through 22.5.0, there is a remote DoS and possible RCE condition in `asterisk/res/res_stir_shaken /verification.c` that can be exploited when an attacker can set an arbitrary Identity header, or STIR/SHAKEN is enabled, with verification set in the SIP profile associated with the endpoint to be attacked. This is fixed in versions 18.26.3, 20.7-cert6, 20.15.1, 21.10.1 and 22.5.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"544aceb34f061af5371994e9e0701e0231d4409f"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"5b15600bd766b21b12a5d73e3050e3ec4f2e8db9"},{"fixed":"356f4d00876f07f6094f8d45a49229f29a3d59f0"}]}],"versions":["18.17.0","18.17.0-rc1","18.17.1","18.18.0","18.18.0-rc1","18.18.1","18.19.0","18.19.0-rc1","18.19.0-rc2","18.20.0","18.20.0-rc1","18.20.1","18.20.2","18.21.0","18.21.0-rc1","18.21.0-rc2","18.22.0","18.22.0-rc1","18.22.0-rc2","18.23.0","18.23.0-rc1","18.23.1","18.24.0","18.24.0-rc1","18.24.1","18.24.2","18.24.3","18.25.0","18.25.0-rc1","18.25.0-rc2","18.26.0","18.26.0-rc1","18.26.1","18.26.2","certified-20.7-cert6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-49832.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/security/advisories/GHSA-mrq5-74j5-f5cr"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
