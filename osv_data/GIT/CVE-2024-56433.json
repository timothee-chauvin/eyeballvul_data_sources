NOTE: it may also be argued that system administrators should not have assigned uids, within local networks, that are within the range that can occur in /etc/subuid.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"68061f2059124f5aa450dfbf6bbad3e7a6f65f9f"}]}],"versions":["4.2.1","4.3.0","4.3.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-56433.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/blob/e2512d5741d4a44bdd81a8c2d0029b6222728cf0/etc/login.defs#L238-L241"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/releases/tag/4.4"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/issues/1157"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
