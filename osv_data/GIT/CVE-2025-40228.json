Fix the two bugs.\n\n\nThis patch (of 2):\n\nThe damon_ctx for testing online DAMON parameters commit inputs is used\nwithout its allocation failure check.  This could result in an invalid\nmemory access.  Fix it by directly returning an error when the allocation\nfailed.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"4c9ea539ad59ec60676930dacee02b7adde2e0c0"},{"fixed":"5b3609d9b9650bdea0bfdf643e0ce57e1aed67fc"},{"fixed":"f0c5118ebb0eb7e4fd6f0d2ace3315ca141b317f"}]}],"versions":["v6.14","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.18-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40228.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.15.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40228.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5b3609d9b9650bdea0bfdf643e0ce57e1aed67fc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f0c5118ebb0eb7e4fd6f0d2ace3315ca141b317f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40228.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40228"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40228.json"}}
