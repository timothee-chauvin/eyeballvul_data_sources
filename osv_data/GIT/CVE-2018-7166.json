{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2018-7166","published":"2018-08-21T12:29:00.320Z","modified":"2025-11-20T10:53:18.634975Z","details":"In all versions of Node.js 10 prior to 10.9.0, an argument processing flaw can cause `Buffer.alloc()` to return uninitialized memory. This method is intended to be safe and only return initialized, or cleared, memory. The third argument specifying `encoding` can be passed as a number, this is misinterpreted by `Buffer's` internal \"fill\" method as the `start` to a fill operation. This flaw may be abused where `Buffer.alloc()` arguments are derived from user input to return uncleared memory blocks that may contain sensitive information.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nodejs/node","events":[{"introduced":"cf41627411886000429bde058a6594fb7f6d6d47"},{"fixed":"03b825811ed4af0addcdf6e75bacb3dc1c4c5940"}]}],"versions":["v10.0.0","v10.1.0","v10.2.0","v10.2.1","v10.3.0","v10.4.0","v10.4.1","v10.5.0","v10.6.0","v10.7.0","v10.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-7166.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2553"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/august-2018-security-releases/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
