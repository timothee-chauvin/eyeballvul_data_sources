{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-11266","published":"2025-12-12T21:15:51.653Z","modified":"2025-12-17T05:49:32.000083Z","details":"An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the Grassroots DICOM library (GDCM). The issue is triggered during parsing of a malformed DICOM file containing encapsulated PixelData fragments (compressed image data stored as multiple fragments). This vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault caused by an out-of-bounds memory access due to unsigned integer underflow in buffer indexing. It is exploitable via file input, simply opening a crafted malicious DICOM file is sufficient to trigger the crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/malaterre/gdcm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2d66f14563fb5e32fd538744f6c9fe532ddd3526"}]}],"versions":["v2.0.10","v2.0.11","v2.0.12","v2.0.13","v2.0.14","v2.0.15","v2.0.16","v2.0.17","v2.0.18","v2.0.19","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.0.9","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.2.5","v2.2.6","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.5","v2.4.6","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.6.3","v2.6.4","v2.6.5","v2.6.6","v2.6.7","v2.6.8","v2.6.9","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.8.3","v2.8.4","v2.8.5","v2.8.6","v2.8.7","v2.8.8","v2.8.9","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.10","v3.0.11","v3.0.12","v3.0.13","v3.0.14","v3.0.15","v3.0.16","v3.0.17","v3.0.18","v3.0.19","v3.0.2","v3.0.20","v3.0.21","v3.0.22","v3.0.23","v3.0.24","v3.0.25","v3.0.26","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.0.8","v3.0.9","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v3.2.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-11266.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF/blob/develop/csaf_files/OT/white/2025/icsma-25-345-01.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/malaterre/GDCM/releases/tag/v3.2.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-25-345-01"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
