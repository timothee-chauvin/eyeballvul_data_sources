However, we\ndo not hold a reference to the folio before performing these actions,\nwhich means the folio can concurrently be released and reused as another\nfolio/page/slab.\n\nGet around this altogether by just using xarray's existing machinery for\nthe folio page offsets and dirty/writeback states.\n\nThis changes behavior for tmpfs files to now always report zeroes in their\ndirty and writeback counters.  This is okay as tmpfs doesn't follow\nconventional writeback cache behavior: its pages get \"cleaned\" during\nswapout, after which they're no longer resident etc.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"cf264e1329fb0307e044f7675849f9f38b44c11a"},{"fixed":"ba60fdf75e89ea762bb617be578dc47f27655117"},{"fixed":"fe7e008e0ce728252e4ec652cceebcc62211657c"},{"fixed":"3a75cb05d53f4a6823a32deb078de1366954a804"}]}],"versions":["v6.4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.3","v6.6.4","v6.6.5","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.7.1","v6.7.2","v6.7.3","v6.7.4","v6.7.5","v6.7.6","v6.7.7","v6.7.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-26630.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.5.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.21"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.7.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-26630.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3a75cb05d53f4a6823a32deb078de1366954a804"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ba60fdf75e89ea762bb617be578dc47f27655117"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fe7e008e0ce728252e4ec652cceebcc62211657c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/26xxx/CVE-2024-26630.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26630"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/26xxx/CVE-2024-26630.json"}}
