In this case we initiate a dump\nbut don't call ->dump() until there is read space for\nan skb.\n\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 5845 at net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2210 netlink_ack_tlv_fill+0x1a8/0x560 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2209\nRIP: 0010:netlink_ack_tlv_fill+0x1a8/0x560 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2209\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n netlink_dump_done+0x513/0x970 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2250\n netlink_dump+0x91f/0xe10 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2351\n netlink_recvmsg+0x6bb/0x11d0 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1983\n sock_recvmsg_nosec net/socket.c:1051 [inline]\n sock_recvmsg+0x22f/0x280 net/socket.c:1073\n __sys_recvfrom+0x246/0x3d0 net/socket.c:2267\n __do_sys_recvfrom net/socket.c:2285 [inline]\n __se_sys_recvfrom net/socket.c:2281 [inline]\n __x64_sys_recvfrom+0xde/0x100 net/socket.c:2281\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xf3/0x230 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\n RIP: 0033:0x7ff37dd17a79","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"8af4f60472fce1f22db5068107b37bcc1a65eabd"},{"fixed":"6406d0ce0414b807af5d2a4b781c3f3ee52b8a4d"},{"fixed":"28af028a71371df5fcbf807fd4444bba8d0c33cc"},{"fixed":"3bf39fa849ab8ed52abb6715922e6102d3df9f97"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.11.1","v6.11.10","v6.11.2","v6.11.3","v6.11.4","v6.11.5","v6.11.6","v6.11.7","v6.11.8","v6.11.9","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.9","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-53212.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.10.0"},{"fixed":"6.11.11"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-53212.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/28af028a71371df5fcbf807fd4444bba8d0c33cc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3bf39fa849ab8ed52abb6715922e6102d3df9f97"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6406d0ce0414b807af5d2a4b781c3f3ee52b8a4d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/53xxx/CVE-2024-53212.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53212"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/53xxx/CVE-2024-53212.json"}}
