And we\ncould fix the flush order issue and do flush optimization later.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"b4a6bb3a67aa0c37b2b6cd47efc326eb455de674"},{"fixed":"e39e870e1e683a71d3d2e63e661a5695f60931a7"},{"fixed":"c7ab7e45ccef209809f8c2b00f497deec06b29c0"},{"fixed":"c1dbd8a849183b9c12d257ad3043ecec50db50b3"}]}],"versions":["v6.2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.4.1","v6.4.10","v6.4.11","v6.4.12","v6.4.13","v6.4.14","v6.4.15","v6.4.2","v6.4.3","v6.4.4","v6.4.5","v6.4.6","v6.4.7","v6.4.8","v6.4.9","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.5.1","v6.5.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54089.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.3.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.16"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.5.0"},{"fixed":"6.5.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54089.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c1dbd8a849183b9c12d257ad3043ecec50db50b3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c7ab7e45ccef209809f8c2b00f497deec06b29c0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e39e870e1e683a71d3d2e63e661a5695f60931a7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54089.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54089"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54089.json"}}
