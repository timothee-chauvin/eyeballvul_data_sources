{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2019-18790","published":"2019-11-22T17:15:11.740Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:33:36.570214Z","details":"An issue was discovered in channels/chan_sip.c in Sangoma Asterisk 13.x before 13.29.2, 16.x before 16.6.2, and 17.x before 17.0.1, and Certified Asterisk 13.21 before cert5. A SIP request can be sent to Asterisk that can change a SIP peer's IP address. A REGISTER does not need to occur, and calls can be hijacked as a result. The only thing that needs to be known is the peer's name; authentication details such as passwords do not need to be known. This vulnerability is only exploitable when the nat option is set to the default, or auto_force_rport.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"85335355efb2d7914a1fe20ed31afcef15fd210c"},{"fixed":"1863c35fc3f888d726e54e8674ec78a7cd099e34"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-18790.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2019-006.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/11/msg00038.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/04/msg00001.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.asterisk.org/downloads/security-advisories"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
