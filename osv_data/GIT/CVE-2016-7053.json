{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2016-7053","published":"2017-05-04T19:29:00.213Z","modified":"2025-11-20T10:31:03.020446Z","details":"In OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c, applications parsing invalid CMS structures can crash with a NULL pointer dereference. This is caused by a bug in the handling of the ASN.1 CHOICE type in OpenSSL 1.1.0 which can result in a NULL value being passed to the structure callback if an attempt is made to free certain invalid encodings. Only CHOICE structures using a callback which do not handle NULL value are affected.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openssl/openssl","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"7ea5bd2b52d0e81eaef3d109b3b12545306f201c"}]}],"versions":["BEFORE_engine","OpenSSL_0_9_1c","OpenSSL_0_9_2b","OpenSSL_0_9_3","OpenSSL_0_9_3a","OpenSSL_0_9_3beta2","OpenSSL_0_9_4","OpenSSL_0_9_5a","OpenSSL_0_9_5a-beta1","OpenSSL_0_9_5a-beta2","OpenSSL_0_9_5beta1","OpenSSL_0_9_5beta2","OpenSSL_0_9_6-beta3","OpenSSL_1_1_0","OpenSSL_1_1_0-pre1","OpenSSL_1_1_0-pre2","OpenSSL_1_1_0-pre3","OpenSSL_1_1_0-pre4","OpenSSL_1_1_0-pre5","OpenSSL_1_1_0-pre6","OpenSSL_1_1_0a","OpenSSL_1_1_0b","OpenSSL_1_1_0c","OpenSSL_1_1_0d","OpenSSL_1_1_0e","OpenSSL_1_1_0f","OpenSSL_1_1_0g","OpenSSL_1_1_0h","OpenSSL_1_1_0i","OpenSSL_1_1_0j","OpenSSL_1_1_0k","OpenSSL_1_1_0l","master-post-auto-reformat","master-post-reformat","master-pre-auto-reformat","master-pre-reformat"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2016-7053.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037261"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://h20566.www2.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbhf03744en_us"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94244"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20161110.txt"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
