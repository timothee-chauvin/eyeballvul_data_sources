This bug was found by the kernel test robot using\nCONFIG_KASAN while running the firmware selftests.\n\n  device_unregister(&fw_sysfs->dev);\n  module_put(fw_upload_priv->module);\n\nThe problem is fixed by copying fw_upload_priv->module to a local variable\nfor use when calling device_unregister().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"97730bbb242cde22b7140acd202ffd88823886c9"},{"fixed":"d380d40930a674c520a5b55f3be1eb17dc634ebc"},{"fixed":"8b40c38e37492b5bdf8e95b46b5cca9517a9957a"}]}],"versions":["v5.18","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.19.1","v5.19.2","v5.19.3","v5.19.4","v5.19.5","v5.19.6","v5.19.7","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49951.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.19.0"},{"fixed":"5.19.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49951.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8b40c38e37492b5bdf8e95b46b5cca9517a9957a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d380d40930a674c520a5b55f3be1eb17dc634ebc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49951.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49951"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49951.json"}}
