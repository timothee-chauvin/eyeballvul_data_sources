{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-46233","published":"2023-10-25T20:49:31.582Z","modified":"2025-12-05T00:09:12.772822Z","aliases":["GHSA-xwcq-pm8m-c4vf"],"summary":"crypto-js PBKDF2 1,000 times weaker than specified in 1993 and 1.3M times weaker than current standard","details":"crypto-js is a JavaScript library of crypto standards. Prior to version 4.2.0, crypto-js PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993, and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current industry standard. This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005, and defaults to one single iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. Version 4.2.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure crypto-js to use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/brix/crypto-js","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"808f499ec789fcd68416328a40b8735a5c962116"}]}],"versions":["3.1.3","3.1.4","3.1.5","3.1.6","3.1.7","3.1.8","3.1.9","3.1.9-1","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.3.0","4.0.0","4.1.0","4.1.1","release-3.1.2","release-3.1.2-1","release-3.1.2-2","release-3.1.2-3","release-3.1.2-4","release-3.1.2-5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-46233.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/46xxx/CVE-2023-46233.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/commit/421dd538b2d34e7c24a5b72cc64dc2b9167db40a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/security/advisories/GHSA-xwcq-pm8m-c4vf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00025.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46233"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-328","CWE-916"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/46xxx/CVE-2023-46233.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
