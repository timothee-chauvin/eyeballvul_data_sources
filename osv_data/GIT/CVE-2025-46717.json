{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-46717","published":"2025-05-12T14:52:55Z","modified":"2025-10-21T19:33:08Z","aliases":["GHSA-98cv-wqjx-wx8f"],"summary":"sudo-rs Allows Low Privilege Users to Discover the Existence of Files in Inaccessible Folders","details":"sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust. Prior to version 0.2.6, users with no (or very limited) sudo privileges can determine whether files exists in folders that they otherwise cannot access using `sudo --list <pathname>`. Users with local access to a machine can discover the existence/non-existence of certain files, revealing potentially sensitive information in the file names. This information can also be used in conjunction with other attacks. Version 0.2.6 fixes the vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"33f17c2a20aa93feec01437a08fb9aa8ddd61f7c"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-46717.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-98cv-wqjx-wx8f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs/releases/tag/v0.2.6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-497"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
