A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in versions 0.5.0 and earlier, wherein if a policy name is called __proto__, one can override the Object prototype. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.0. A workaround involves disabling prototype method in NodeJS, neutralizing all possible prototype pollution attacks. Provide either --disable-proto=delete (recommended) or --disable-proto=throw as an argument to node to enable this feature.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/helmetjs/content-security-policy-parser","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"927f922cb188b49009d82a1e3a3f5afdf99d2c4f"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-55164.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/helmetjs/content-security-policy-parser/commit/b13a52554f0168af393e3e38ed4a94e9e6aea9dc"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/helmetjs/content-security-policy-parser/issues/11"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/helmetjs/content-security-policy-parser/security/advisories/GHSA-w2cq-g8g3-gm83"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2025-55164-detect-node-csp-parser-vulnerability"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2025-55164-mitigate-csp-parser-vulnerability"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1321"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
