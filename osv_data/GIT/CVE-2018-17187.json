{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2018-17187","published":"2018-11-13T15:29:00.313Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:35:33.338049Z","aliases":["GHSA-xvch-r4wf-h8w9"],"details":"The Apache Qpid Proton-J transport includes an optional wrapper layer to perform TLS, enabled by use of the 'transport.ssl(...)' methods. Unless a verification mode was explicitly configured, client and server modes previously defaulted as documented to not verifying a peer certificate, with options to configure this explicitly or select a certificate verification mode with or without hostname verification being performed. The latter hostname verifying mode was not implemented in Apache Qpid Proton-J versions 0.3 to 0.29.0, with attempts to use it resulting in an exception. This left only the option to verify the certificate is trusted, leaving such a client vulnerable to Man In The Middle (MITM) attack. Uses of the Proton-J protocol engine which do not utilise the optional transport TLS wrapper are not impacted, e.g. usage within Qpid JMS. Uses of Proton-J utilising the optional transport TLS wrapper layer that wish to enable hostname verification must be upgraded to version 0.30.0 or later and utilise the VerifyMode#VERIFY_PEER_NAME configuration, which is now the default for client mode usage unless configured otherwise.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/qpid-proton-j","events":[{"introduced":"5b8f241139962b1c4ef17a37f58ac6636845d1b7"},{"last_affected":"755e8f67b39c33e36687b8005e868f0d19346140"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-17187.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/qpid-users/201811.mbox/%3CCAFitrpQSV73Vz7rJYfLJK7gvEymZSCR5ooWUeU8j4jzRydk-eg%40mail.gmail.com%3E"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://qpid.apache.org/cves/CVE-2018-17187.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105935"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PROTON-1962"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
