Cap'n Proro prior to versions 0.7.1, 0.8.1, 0.9.2, and 0.10.3, as well as versions of Cap'n Proto's Rust implementation prior to 0.13.7, 0.14.11, and 0.15.2 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read due to logic error handling list-of-list. This issue may lead someone to remotely segfault a peer by sending it a malicious message, if the victim performs certain actions on a list-of-pointer type. Exfiltration of memory is possible if the victim performs additional certain actions on a list-of-pointer type. To be vulnerable, an application must perform a specific sequence of actions, described in the GitHub Security Advisory. The bug is present in inlined code, therefore the fix will require rebuilding dependent applications. Cap'n Proto has C++ fixes available in versions 0.7.1, 0.8.1, 0.9.2, and 0.10.3. The `capnp` Rust crate has fixes available in versions 0.13.7, 0.14.11, and 0.15.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0b48fcac744dabae6b28115161e476124108d845"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.7.1"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto","events":[{"introduced":"57a4ca5af5a7f55b768a9d9d6655250bffb1257f"},{"fixed":"5ee4c653fc3ef0d8a3a2a1e1ceb61f6b172bde91"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0.8.0"},{"fixed":"0.8.1"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto","events":[{"introduced":"7f554a89784d3455970fe1edfb9f0044ac570aeb"},{"fixed":"0274bf17374df912ea834687c667bed33bd318db"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0.9.0"},{"fixed":"0.9.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto","events":[{"introduced":"52f185c227d8f6449b45b6b172eec644aa0528b5"},{"fixed":"a16468f296a9584f4068072efecdee8a9eb9c2ed"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0.10.0"},{"fixed":"0.10.3"}]}}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v0.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-46149.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/commit/25d34c67863fd960af34fc4f82a7ca3362ee74b9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/security/advisories/GHSA-qqff-4vw4-f6hx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EAHKLUMJAXJEV5BPBS5XXWBQ3ZTHGOLY/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PTS6TWD6K2NKXLEEFBPROQXMOFUTEYWY/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WKXM4JAFXLTXU5IQB3OUBQVCIICZWGYX/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZOCQQOPMVQOFUWBWAGVGN76OYAV3WXY4/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-125"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L"}]}
