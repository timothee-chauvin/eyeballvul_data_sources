{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68740","published":"2025-12-24T12:09:37.971Z","modified":"2025-12-24T22:08:20.815020Z","summary":"ima: Handle error code returned by ima_filter_rule_match()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nima: Handle error code returned by ima_filter_rule_match()\n\nIn ima_match_rules(), if ima_filter_rule_match() returns -ENOENT due to\nthe rule being NULL, the function incorrectly skips the 'if (!rc)' check\nand sets 'result = true'. The LSM rule is considered a match, causing\nextra files to be measured by IMA.\n\nThis issue can be reproduced in the following scenario:\nAfter unloading the SELinux policy module via 'semodule -d', if an IMA\nmeasurement is triggered before ima_lsm_rules is updated,\nin ima_match_rules(), the first call to ima_filter_rule_match() returns\n-ESTALE. This causes the code to enter the 'if (rc == -ESTALE &&\n!rule_reinitialized)' block, perform ima_lsm_copy_rule() and retry. In\nima_lsm_copy_rule(), since the SELinux module has been removed, the rule\nbecomes NULL, and the second call to ima_filter_rule_match() returns\n-ENOENT. This bypasses the 'if (!rc)' check and results in a false match.\n\nCall trace:\n  selinux_audit_rule_match+0x310/0x3b8\n  security_audit_rule_match+0x60/0xa0\n  ima_match_rules+0x2e4/0x4a0\n
