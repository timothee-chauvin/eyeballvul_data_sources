This lead to array-index-out-of-bounds error.\n\nFix it by checking whether the command is known before collecting the\nfailure data.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"34f46ae0d4b38e83cfb26fb6f06b5b5efea47fdc"},{"fixed":"411e4d6caa7f7169192b8dacc8421ac4fd64a354"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"34f46ae0d4b38e83cfb26fb6f06b5b5efea47fdc"},{"fixed":"d8b6f175235d7327b4e1b13216859e89496dfbd5"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"34f46ae0d4b38e83cfb26fb6f06b5b5efea47fdc"},{"fixed":"2a0a935fb64ee8af253b9c6133bb6702fb152ac2"}]}],"versions":["v5.17","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.3.1","v6.3.2","v6.3.3","v6.3.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53340.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.31"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.3.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53340.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2a0a935fb64ee8af253b9c6133bb6702fb152ac2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/411e4d6caa7f7169192b8dacc8421ac4fd64a354"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d8b6f175235d7327b4e1b13216859e89496dfbd5"}]}
