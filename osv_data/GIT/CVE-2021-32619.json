  "details": "Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust. In Deno versions 1.5.0 to 1.10.1, modules that are dynamically imported through `import()` or `new Worker` might have been able to bypass network and file system permission checks when statically importing other modules. The vulnerability has been patched in Deno release 1.10.2.",
