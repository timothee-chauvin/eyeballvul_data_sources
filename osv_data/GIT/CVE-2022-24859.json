In versions prior to 1.27.5 an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if the PyPDF2 if the code attempts to get the content stream. The reason is that the last while-loop in `ContentStream._readInlineImage` only terminates when it finds the `EI` token, but never actually checks if the stream has already ended. This issue has been resolved in version `1.27.5`. Users unable to upgrade should validate and PDFs prior to iterating over their content stream.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf2","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"733989af6fc0f87d69d78509f3766b47ffc24e1d"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.27.5"}]}}],"versions":["1.26.0","1.27.0","1.27.1","1.27.2","1.27.3","1.27.4","v1.17","v1.18","v1.19","v1.20","v1.21","v1.22","v1.23","v1.24","v1.25","v1.25.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24859.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"733989af6fc0f87d69d78509f3766b47ffc24e1d"}]}],"versions":["1.26.0","1.27.0","1.27.1","1.27.2","1.27.3","1.27.4","v1.17","v1.18","v1.19","v1.20","v1.21","v1.22","v1.23","v1.24","v1.25","v1.25.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24859.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/issues/329"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/pull/740"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/releases/tag/1.27.5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/security/advisories/GHSA-xcjx-m2pj-8g79"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/06/msg00001.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00013.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-835"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
