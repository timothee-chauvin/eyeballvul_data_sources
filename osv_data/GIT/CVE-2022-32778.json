The session cookie and the pass cookie miss the HttpOnly flag, making them accessible via JavaScript. The session cookie also misses the secure flag, which allows the session cookie to be leaked over non-HTTPS connections. This could allow an attacker to steal the session cookie via crafted HTTP requests.This vulnerability is for the pass cookie, which contains the hashed password and can be leaked via JavaScript.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wwbn/avideo","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"87a23fa13b97c7a9ca8a14701e0ba569e60a6713"}]}],"versions":["10.4","10.8","11","11.1","11.1.1","11.5","11.6","2.2","2.4","2.7","3.4","3.4.1","4.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","5.0","6.5","7.2","7.3","7.4","7.5","7.6","7.7","7.8","8.1","8.5","8.6","8.7","8.9","8.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-32778.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/WWBN/AVideo/blob/e04b1cd7062e16564157a82bae389eedd39fa088/updatedb/updateDb.v12.0.sql"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2022-1542"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
