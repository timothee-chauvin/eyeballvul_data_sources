{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-67737","published":"2025-12-12T06:53:15.213Z","modified":"2025-12-13T04:54:35.998190Z","aliases":["GHSA-9449-rphm-mjqr"],"summary":"AzuraCast Vulnerable to Pre-Auth File Deletion & Admin RCE","details":"AzuraCast is a self-hosted, all-in-one web radio management suite. Versions 0.23.1 mistakenly include an API endpoint that is intended for internal use by the SFTP software sftpgo, exposing it to the public-facing HTTP API for AzuraCast installations. A user with specific internal knowledge of a station's operations can craft a custom HTTP request that would affect the contents of a station's database, without revealing any internal information about the station. In order to carry out an attack, a malicious user would need to know a valid SFTP station username and the coordinating internal filesystem structure. This issue is fixed in version 0.23.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/azuracast/azuracast","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ee8a4ad47edc61639140d0c825f0268fc79467b0"}]}],"versions":["0.10.0","0.10.1","0.10.2","0.10.3","0.10.4","0.11","0.11.1","0.11.2","0.12","0.12.1","0.12.2","0.12.3","0.12.4","0.13.0","0.14.0","0.14.1","0.15.0","0.15.1","0.15.2","0.16.0","0.16.1","0.17.0","0.17.1","0.17.2","0.17.3","0.17.4","0.17.5","0.17.6","0.17.7","0.18.0","0.18.1","0.18.2","0.18.3","0.18.5","0.19.0","0.19.1","0.19.2","0.19.3","0.19.4","0.19.5","0.19.6","0.19.7","0.20.0","0.20.1","0.20.2","0.20.3","0.20.4","0.21.0","0.22.0","0.22.1","0.23.0","0.23.1","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.3.3","0.5.0","0.6.0","0.8.0","0.9.0","0.9.1","0.9.2","0.9.3","0.9.4","0.9.4.1","0.9.4.2","0.9.5","0.9.5.1","0.9.6","0.9.6.1","0.9.6.2","0.9.6.5","0.9.7","0.9.7.1","0.9.8","0.9.8.1","0.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67737.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/AzuraCast/AzuraCast/commit/34620dbad93f6cd8e209a4220e3e53c7c5fea844"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/AzuraCast/AzuraCast/security/advisories/GHSA-9449-rphm-mjqr"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67737.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67737"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-862"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67737.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
