Due to a missing authorization check, **Actions** were able to grant authorizations for projects that belong to other organizations inside the same Instance. Granting authorizations via API and Console is not affected by this vulnerability. There is currently no known workaround, users should update.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel","events":[{"introduced":"5b284f8c9ba65a88fb4d58ac6aa34be429b19e8e"},{"fixed":"4c26665b933dd763aa8c2779bce368708f7a7029"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.2.0"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel","events":[{"introduced":"ed80a8bb1e181b35f80907f068811471f3ef8ad6"},{"fixed":"cfb00c14a32d110224beb3282caa82f8f274ab93"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.42.0"},{"fixed":"1.87.1"}]}}],"versions":["v1.42.0","v1.42.1","v1.42.2","v1.43.0","v1.43.1","v1.43.2","v1.43.3","v1.43.4","v1.44.0","v1.44.1","v1.44.2","v1.44.3","v1.45.0","v1.45.1","v1.45.2","v1.45.3","v1.45.4","v1.45.5","v1.45.6","v1.46.0","v1.46.1","v1.46.2","v1.46.3","v1.46.4","v1.47.0","v1.47.1","v1.47.2","v1.47.3","v1.47.4","v1.47.5","v1.47.6","v1.48.0","v1.48.1","v1.48.2","v1.48.3","v1.48.4","v1.48.5","v1.48.6","v1.48.7","v1.48.8","v1.49.0","v1.49.1","v1.50.0","v1.50.1","v1.50.2","v1.50.3","v1.50.4","v1.51.0","v1.52.0","v1.52.1","v1.52.2","v1.53.0","v1.53.1","v1.53.2","v1.54.0","v1.54.1","v1.54.10","v1.54.2","v1.54.3","v1.54.4","v1.54.5","v1.54.6","v1.54.7","v1.54.8","v1.54.9","v1.55.0","v1.55.1","v1.55.2","v1.56.0","v1.56.1","v1.56.10","v1.56.11","v1.56.12","v1.56.13","v1.56.14","v1.56.15","v1.56.16","v1.56.17","v1.56.18","v1.56.19","v1.56.2","v1.56.20","v1.56.21","v1.56.22","v1.56.3","v1.56.4","v1.56.5","v1.56.6","v1.56.7","v1.56.8","v1.56.9","v1.57.0","v1.57.1","v1.58.0","v1.59.0","v1.59.1","v1.59.2","v1.59.3","v1.60.0","v1.60.1","v1.60.2","v1.60.3","v1.61.0","v1.62.0","v1.62.1","v1.62.2","v1.63.0","v1.64.0","v1.65.0","v1.66.0","v1.66.1","v1.66.2","v1.66.3","v1.66.4","v1.66.5","v1.66.6","v1.66.7","v1.66.8","v1.66.9","v1.67.0","v1.67.1","v1.68.0","v1.68.1","v1.69.0","v1.69.1","v1.69.2","v1.69.3","v1.69.4","v1.69.5","v1.69.6","v1.69.7","v1.69.8","v1.70.0","v1.70.1","v1.70.2","v1.71.0","v1.71.1","v1.71.2","v1.72.0","v1.72.1","v1.73.0","v1.73.1","v1.73.2","v1.73.3","v1.73.4","v1.74.0","v1.75.0","v1.75.1","v1.75.2","v1.75.3","v1.75.4","v1.75.5","v1.75.6","v1.75.7","v1.75.8","v1.76.0","v1.76.1","v1.76.2","v1.77.0","v1.77.1","v1.77.2","v1.78.0","v1.79.0","v1.80.0","v1.80.1","v1.81.0","v1.81.1","v1.82.0","v1.82.1","v1.82.10","v1.82.11","v1.82.12","v1.82.13","v1.82.14","v1.82.15","v1.82.16","v1.82.17","v1.82.2","v1.82.3","v1.82.4","v1.82.5","v1.82.6","v1.82.7","v1.82.8","v1.82.9","v1.83.0","v1.83.1","v1.83.2","v1.83.3","v1.83.4","v1.83.5","v1.83.6","v1.83.7","v1.84.0","v1.84.1","v1.84.2","v1.84.3","v1.84.4","v1.84.5","v1.85.0","v1.86.0","v1.87.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-36051.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v1.87.1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.2.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-c8fj-4pm8-mp2c"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-436"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
