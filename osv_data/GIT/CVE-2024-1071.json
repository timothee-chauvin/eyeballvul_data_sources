This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ultimatemember/ultimatemember","events":[{"introduced":"784191141317e184f9022f86d5e056c2c6f7e848"},{"fixed":"a6a7d13a433b24e468ee10e778e3da5668b6ef59"}]}],"versions":["2.1.10","2.1.11","2.1.12","2.1.13","2.1.14","2.1.15","2.1.16","2.1.17","2.1.18","2.1.19","2.1.20","2.1.21","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.1.7","2.1.8","2.1.9","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.2.4","2.2.5","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.5.4","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.10","2.6.11","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.6.4","2.6.5","2.6.6","2.6.7","2.6.8","2.6.9","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.8.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-1071.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ultimate-member/tags/2.8.2/includes/core/class-member-directory-meta.php?rev=3022076"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ultimate-member/tags/2.8.2/includes/core/class-member-directory-meta.php?rev=3022076#L666"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ultimate-member/tags/2.8.2/includes/core/class-member-directory-meta.php?rev=3022076#L858"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-member/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/005fa621-3c49-4c23-add5-d6b7a9110055?source=cve"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3038036/ultimate-member/trunk/includes/core/class-member-directory-meta.php"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
