If using `keep_typographic_whitespace=False` (which is the default), the sanitizer normalizes unicode to the NFKC form at the end. Some unicode characters normalize to chevrons; this allows specially crafted HTML to escape sanitization. The problem has been fixed in 2.4.2.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/matthiask/html-sanitizer","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"024004d53f8322548ed98fbe640759667dc6fc64"}]}],"versions":["1.0","1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.2","1.2.1","1.3","1.4","1.5","1.6","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.6.4","1.7","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.7.3","1.8","1.9","1.9.1","1.9.2","1.9.3","2.0","2.1","2.2","2.3","2.3.1","2.4","2.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-34078.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/matthiask/html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-wvhx-q427-fgh3"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/matthiask/html-sanitizer/commit/48db42fc5143d0140c32d929c46b802f96913550"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/08/msg00000.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
