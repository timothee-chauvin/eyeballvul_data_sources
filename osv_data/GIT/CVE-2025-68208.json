{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68208","published":"2025-12-16T13:48:35.298Z","modified":"2025-12-16T20:35:29.786470Z","summary":"bpf: account for current allocated stack depth in widen_imprecise_scalars()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: account for current allocated stack depth in widen_imprecise_scalars()\n\nThe usage pattern for widen_imprecise_scalars() looks as follows:\n\n    prev_st = find_prev_entry(env, ...);\n    queued_st = push_stack(...);\n    widen_imprecise_scalars(env, prev_st, queued_st);\n\nWhere prev_st is an ancestor of the queued_st in the explored states\ntree. This ancestor is not guaranteed to have same allocated stack\ndepth as queued_st. E.g. in the following case:\n\n    def main():\n      for i in 1..2:\n        foo(i)        // same callsite, differnt param\n\n    def foo(i):\n      if i == 1:\n        use 128 bytes of stack\n      iterator based loop\n\nHere, for a second 'foo' call prev_st->allocated_stack is 128,\nwhile queued_st->allocated_stack is much smaller.\nwiden_imprecise_scalars() needs to take this into account and avoid\naccessing bpf_verifier_state->frame[*]->stack out of bounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ab470fefce2837e66b771c60858118d50bb5bb10"},{"fixed":"64b12dca2b0abcb5fc0542887d18b926ea5cf711"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"2793a8b015f7f1caadb9bce9c63dc659f7522676"},{"fixed":"9944c7938cd5b3f37b0afec0481c7c015e4f1c58"},{"fixed":"57e04e2ff56e32f923154f0f7bc476fcb596ffe7"},{"fixed":"b0c8e6d3d866b6a7f73877f71968dbffd27b7785"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.6","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.100","v6.6.101","v6.6.102","v6.6.103","v6.6.104","v6.6.105","v6.6.106","v6.6.107","v6.6.108","v6.6.109","v6.6.110","v6.6.111","v6.6.112","v6.6.113","v6.6.114","v6.6.115","v6.6.116","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.59","v6.6.60","v6.6.61","v6.6.62","v6.6.63","v6.6.64","v6.6.65","v6.6.66","v6.6.67","v6.6.68","v6.6.69","v6.6.70","v6.6.71","v6.6.72","v6.6.73","v6.6.74","v6.6.75","v6.6.76","v6.6.77","v6.6.78","v6.6.79","v6.6.80","v6.6.81","v6.6.82","v6.6.83","v6.6.84","v6.6.85","v6.6.86","v6.6.87","v6.6.88","v6.6.89","v6.6.90","v6.6.91","v6.6.92","v6.6.93","v6.6.94","v6.6.95","v6.6.96","v6.6.97","v6.6.98","v6.6.99","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68208.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.6.117"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.59"},{"fixed":"6.17.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68208.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/57e04e2ff56e32f923154f0f7bc476fcb596ffe7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/64b12dca2b0abcb5fc0542887d18b926ea5cf711"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9944c7938cd5b3f37b0afec0481c7c015e4f1c58"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b0c8e6d3d866b6a7f73877f71968dbffd27b7785"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68208.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68208"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68208.json"}}
