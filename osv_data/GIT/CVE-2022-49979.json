In order to forward wakeup\nsmc socket waitqueue after fallback, kernel will sets\nclcsk->sk_user_data to origin smc socket in\nsmc_fback_replace_callbacks().\n\nLater, in shutdown syscall, kernel will calls\nsk_psock_get(), which treats the clcsk->sk_user_data\nas psock type, triggering the refcnt warning.\n\nSo, the root cause is that smc and psock, both will use\nsk_user_data field. So they will mismatch this field\neasily.\n\nThis patch solves it by using another bit(defined as\nSK_USER_DATA_PSOCK) in PTRMASK, to mark whether\nsk_user_data points to a psock object or not.\nThis patch depends on a PTRMASK introduced in commit f1ff5ce2cd5e\n(\"net, sk_msg: Clear sk_user_data pointer on clone if tagged\").\n\nFor there will possibly be more flags in the sk_user_data field,\nthis patch also refactor sk_user_data flags code to be more generic\nto improve its
