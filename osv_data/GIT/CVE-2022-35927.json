{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-35927","published":"2022-08-04T20:35:14Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:31:55.961662Z","aliases":["GHSA-9rm9-3phh-p4wm"],"summary":"Unverified DIO prefix info lengths in RPL-Classic in Contiki-NG","details":"Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. In the RPL-Classic routing protocol implementation in the Contiki-NG operating system, an incoming DODAG Information Option (DIO) control message can contain a prefix information option with a length parameter. The value of the length parameter is not validated, however, and it is possible to cause a buffer overflow when copying the prefix in the set_ip_from_prefix function. This vulnerability affects anyone running a Contiki-NG version prior to 4.7 that can receive RPL DIO messages from external parties. To obtain a patched version, users should upgrade to Contiki-NG 4.7 or later. There are no workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a5313885d44c496ef0f5b8a689c84840e0f9e3fd"}]}],"versions":["2.0","2.1","2.2","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.3","2.4","2.5-release","2.6","2.6-rc0","3.x","develop/v3.x-fork","develop/v4.0","develop/v4.1","develop/v4.2","develop/v4.3","develop/v4.4","develop/v4.5","develop/v4.6","develop/v4.7","fork","old/v2.0","old/v2.1","old/v2.2","old/v2.2.1","old/v2.2.2","old/v2.2.3","old/v2.3","old/v2.4","old/v2.6","release/v4.0","release/v4.1","release/v4.2","release/v4.3","release/v4.4","release/v4.5","release/v4.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35927.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-9rm9-3phh-p4wm"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1589"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1589/commits/4fffab0e632c4d01910fa957d1fd9ef321eb87d2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-120"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
