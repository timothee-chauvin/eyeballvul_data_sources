{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-36020","published":"2022-09-13T16:55:10Z","modified":"2025-12-04T10:32:51.481437Z","aliases":["GHSA-47m6-46mj-p235"],"summary":"Bypass of Cross-Site Scripting Protection in typo3/html-sanitizer","details":"The typo3/html-sanitizer package is an HTML sanitizer, written in PHP, aiming to provide XSS-safe markup based on explicitly allowed tags, attributes and values. Due to a parsing issue in the upstream package `masterminds/html5`, malicious markup used in a sequence with special HTML comments cannot be filtered and sanitized. This allows for a bypass of the cross-site scripting mechanism of `typo3/html-sanitizer`. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.0.7 and 2.0.16 of the `typo3/html-sanitizer` package. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/typo3/html-sanitizer","events":[{"introduced":"ca1c30b9b5c160024257f456606b1f3f17138ca6"},{"fixed":"37f1d10d762cf8019594ff596d9207f7551001ad"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.0.0"},{"fixed":"1.0.7"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/typo3/html-sanitizer","events":[{"introduced":"b32bbd462406f28d1fca4bde8a8cd8b49a4bdd39"},{"fixed":"60bfdc7f9b394d0236e16ee4cea8372a7defa493"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.0.16"}]}}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.10","v2.0.11","v2.0.12","v2.0.13","v2.0.14","v2.0.15","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-36020.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/36xxx/CVE-2022-36020.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/commit/60bfdc7f9b394d0236e16ee4cea8372a7defa493"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-47m6-46mj-p235"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36020"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://packagist.org/packages/masterminds/html5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/html-sanitizer"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/36xxx/CVE-2022-36020.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
