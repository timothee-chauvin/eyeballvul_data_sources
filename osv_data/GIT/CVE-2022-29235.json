{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-29235","published":"2022-06-01T23:25:18Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:29:11.405015Z","aliases":["GHSA-x82p-j22f-v4q6"],"summary":"Limited data exposure for shared external videos in BigBlueButton","details":"BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Starting in version 2.2 and prior to versions 2.3.18 and 2.4-rc-6, an attacker who is able to obtain the meeting identifier for a meeting on a server can find information related to an external video being shared, like the current timestamp and play/pause. The problem has been patched in versions 2.3.18 and 2.4-rc-6 by modifying the stream to send the data only for users in the meeting. There are currently no known workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton","events":[{"introduced":"68e35c9d722e62892d2e885646a9eab3bf44f77d"},{"fixed":"0bcb8c2b9e850b99faae7fcfb3d1014e64bff97d"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton","events":[{"introduced":"f037f0a259dd4e6e41e095a5ca4adcb2666bb8dc"},{"fixed":"07cfcd376a44aceb543bcb8f098cf34d73b6b8bf"}]}],"versions":["2.4-rc-2","v2.3.10","v2.3.11","v2.3.12","v2.3.13","v2.3.14","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.7","v2.3.8","v2.3.9","v2.4-alpha-1","v2.4-alpha-2","v2.4-beta-1","v2.4-beta-2","v2.4-beta-3","v2.4-beta-4","v2.4-rc-1","v2.4-rc-3","v2.4-rc-4","v2.4-rc-5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-29235.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-x82p-j22f-v4q6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/13788"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/14265"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.3.18"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.4-rc-6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
