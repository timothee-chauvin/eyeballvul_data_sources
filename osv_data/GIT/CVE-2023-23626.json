When feeding untrusted user input into the size parameter of `NewBitfield` and `FromBytes` functions, an attacker can trigger `panic`s. This happen when the `size` is a not a multiple of `8` or is negative. There were already a note in the `NewBitfield` documentation, however known users of this package are subject to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that `size` is a multiple of 8 before calling `NewBitfield` or `FromBytes`.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"345bb295b923068375b7b171ffc4b0923abd1c11"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-23626.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/security/advisories/GHSA-2h6c-j3gf-xp9r"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/commit/5e1d256fe043fc4163343ccca83862c69c52e579"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-754"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
