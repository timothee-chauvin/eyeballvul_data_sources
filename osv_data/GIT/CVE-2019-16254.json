If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into the response header, an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content to deceive clients. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-17742, which addressed the CRLF vector, but did not address an isolated CR or an isolated LF.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ruby/ruby","events":[{"introduced":"4e0a512972cdcbfcd5279f1a2a81ba342ed75b6e"},{"last_affected":"189a36cfabfc30e785cece0692c802be87ebd9cf"},{"introduced":"c1af7b1e1d408f9796a5f46c9ed36bc5adea4aa2"},{"last_affected":"6315e42c222d5484004494950c7524a85acadb20"},{"introduced":"d4bb726b713658f56e630b6cf817a0155b6f390e"},{"last_affected":"c91478058505cd8cae5160c1056bcde65af5a78b"},{"last_affected":"d40ea2afa6ff5a6e5befcf342fb7b6dc58796b20"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-16254.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/331984"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/11/msg00025.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-06"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4586"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4587"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.ruby-lang.org/ja/news/2019/10/01/http-response-splitting-in-webrick-cve-2019-16254/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.ruby-lang.org/ja/news/2019/10/01/ruby-2-4-8-released/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.ruby-lang.org/ja/news/2019/10/01/ruby-2-5-7-released/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.ruby-lang.org/ja/news/2019/10/01/ruby-2-6-5-released/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-03/msg00041.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/12/msg00009.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/08/msg00027.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00033.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Dec/31"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Dec/32"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
