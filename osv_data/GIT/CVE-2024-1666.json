{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-1666","published":"2024-04-16T00:15:10Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:37:00Z","details":"In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.0, an authorization flaw exists that allows unauthorized radar creation. The vulnerability stems from the lack of server-side checks to verify if a user is on a free account during the radar creation process, which is only enforced in the web UI. As a result, attackers can bypass the intended account upgrade requirement by directly sending crafted requests to the server, enabling the creation of an unlimited number of radars without payment.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c57cd50fa0477fd2a2efe60810c0099eebd66f54"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-1666.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/c57cd50fa0477fd2a2efe60810c0099eebd66f54"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/0f310501-b5b0-4be0-ae38-d6b836f71ff0"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
