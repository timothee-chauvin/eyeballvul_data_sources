{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53021","published":"2025-03-27T16:43:47.860Z","modified":"2025-11-20T00:31:21.734389Z","summary":"net/sched: sch_taprio: fix possible use-after-free","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: sch_taprio: fix possible use-after-free\n\nsyzbot reported a nasty crash [1] in net_tx_action() which\nmade little sense until we got a repro.\n\nThis repro installs a taprio qdisc, but providing an\ninvalid TCA_RATE attribute.\n\nqdisc_create() has to destroy the just initialized\ntaprio qdisc, and taprio_destroy() is called.\n\nHowever, the hrtimer used by taprio had already fired,\ntherefore advance_sched() called __netif_schedule().\n\nThen net_tx_action was trying to use a destroyed qdisc.\n\nWe can not undo the __netif_schedule(), so we must wait\nuntil one cpu serviced the qdisc before we can proceed.\n\nMany thanks to Alexander Potapenko for his help.\n\n[1]\nBUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in queued_spin_trylock include/asm-generic/qspinlock.h:94 [inline]\nBUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in do_raw_spin_trylock include/linux/spinlock.h:191 [inline]\nBUG:
