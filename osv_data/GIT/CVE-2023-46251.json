{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-46251","published":"2023-11-06T17:41:30.378Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:19:49.327028Z","aliases":["BIT-mybb-2023-46251","GHSA-wj33-q7vj-9fr8"],"summary":"Visual editor persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in MyBB","details":" MyBB is a free and open source forum software. Custom MyCode (BBCode) for the visual editor (_SCEditor_) doesn't escape input properly when rendering HTML, resulting in a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. This weakness can be exploited by pointing a victim to a page where the visual editor is active (e.g. as a post or Private Message) and operates on a maliciously crafted MyCode message. This may occur on pages where message content is pre-filled using a GET/POST parameter, or on reply pages where a previously saved malicious message is quoted. The impact is be mitigated when: 1. the visual editor is disabled globally (_Admin CP → Configuration → Settings → Clickable Smilies and BB Code: [Clickable MyCode Editor](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1836/install/resources/settings.xml#L2087-L2094)_ is set to _Off_), or 2. the visual editor is disabled for individual user accounts (_User CP → Your Profile → Edit Options_: _Show the MyCode formatting options on the posting pages_ checkbox is not checked). MyBB 1.8.37 resolves this issue with the commit `6dcaf0b4d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the impact without upgrading MyBB by changing the following setting (_Admin CP → Configuration → Settings_):\n- _Clickable Smilies and BB Code → [Clickable MyCode Editor](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1836/install/resources/settings.xml#L2087-L2094)_: _Off_. Similarly, individual MyBB forum users are able to disable the visual editor by diabling the account option (_User CP → Your Profile → Edit Options_) _Show the MyCode formatting options on the posting pages_.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mybb/mybb","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6dcaf0b4db6254f1833fe8dae295d9ddc2219276"}]}],"versions":["mybb_1800","mybb_1801","mybb_1804","mybb_1805","mybb_1806","mybb_1807","mybb_1808","mybb_1809","mybb_1810","mybb_1811","mybb_1812","mybb_1813","mybb_1814","mybb_1815","mybb_1815_build","mybb_1816","mybb_1816_build","mybb_1817","mybb_1817_build","mybb_1818","mybb_1818_build","mybb_1819","mybb_1819_build","mybb_1820","mybb_1820-rc","mybb_1820_build","mybb_1821","mybb_1821_build","mybb_1821pl1","mybb_1822","mybb_1822_build","mybb_1823","mybb_1823_build","mybb_1824","mybb_1825","mybb_1826","mybb_1827","mybb_1827_build","mybb_1828","mybb_1828_build","mybb_1829","mybb_1830","mybb_1831","mybb_1831_build","mybb_1832","mybb_1832_build","mybb_1833","mybb_1833_build","mybb_1834","mybb_1834_build","mybb_1835","mybb_1835_build","mybb_1836","mybb_1837_build"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-46251.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/6dcaf0b4db6254f1833fe8dae295d9ddc2219276"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/mybb/mybb/security/advisories/GHSA-wj33-q7vj-9fr8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://mybb.com/versions/1.8.37/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
