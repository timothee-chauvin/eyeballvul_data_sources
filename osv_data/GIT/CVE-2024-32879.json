Prior to version 5.4.1, due to default case-insensitive collation in MySQL or MariaDB databases, third-party authentication user IDs are not case-sensitive and could cause different IDs to match. This issue has been addressed by a fix released in version 5.4.1. An immediate workaround would be to change collation of the affected field.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"593ee4638eab9b1d9f252393a21ead643e3ceae6"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.1.0","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0","2.0.0","3.0.0","3.1.0","3.2.0","3.3.0","3.4.0","4.0.0","5.0.0","5.1.0","5.2.0","5.3.0","5.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-32879.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/32xxx/CVE-2024-32879.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/commit/31c3e0c7edb187004d8abbde7e9c4f7ef9098138"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/pull/566"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/security/advisories/GHSA-2gr8-3wc7-xhj3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32879"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-178","CWE-303"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/32xxx/CVE-2024-32879.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
