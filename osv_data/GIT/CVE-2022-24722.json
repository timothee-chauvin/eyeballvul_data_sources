{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-24722","published":"2022-03-02T22:40:11Z","modified":"2025-11-15T04:19:02.010181Z","aliases":["GHSA-cm9w-c4rj-r2cf"],"summary":"Cross-site Scripting in view_component","details":"VIewComponent is a framework for building view components in Ruby on Rails. Versions prior to 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone using translations with the view_component gem. Data received via user input and passed as an interpolation argument to the `translate` method is not properly sanitized before display. Versions 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 have been released and fully mitigate the vulnerability. As a workaround, avoid passing user input to the `translate` function, or sanitize the inputs before passing them.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/github/view_component","events":[{"introduced":"73051f692acfcbe8f3535ef4952e1c1df2d86887"},{"fixed":"e3f065e3c8d47c73d98700040c0efdf4370181ad"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24722.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/viewcomponent/view_component","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3f82a6e62578ff6f361aba24a1feb2caccf83ff9"},{"fixed":"b8a5f4a97f78d60293f57aa12765a0f0007247d4"},{"fixed":"e3f065e3c8d47c73d98700040c0efdf4370181ad"}]}],"versions":["2.23.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.1","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.17.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.9.0","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.11.1","v2.12.0","v2.13.0","v2.14.0","v2.14.1","v2.15.0","v2.16.0","v2.17.0","v2.17.1","v2.18.0","v2.18.1","v2.18.2","v2.19.0","v2.19.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.20.0","v2.21.0","v2.22.0","v2.22.1","v2.23.1","v2.23.2","v2.24.0","v2.25.0","v2.25.1","v2.26.0","v2.26.1","v2.27.0","v2.28.0","v2.29.0","v2.3.0","v2.30.0","v2.31.0","v2.31.1","v2.32.0","v2.33.0","v2.34.0","v2.35.0","v2.36.0","v2.37.0","v2.38.0","v2.39.0","v2.4.0","v2.40.0","v2.41.0","v2.42.0","v2.43.0","v2.43.1","v2.44.0","v2.45.0","v2.46.0","v2.47.0","v2.48.0","v2.49.0","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24722.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/github/view_component/commit/3f82a6e62578ff6f361aba24a1feb2caccf83ff9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/github/view_component/releases/tag/v2.31.2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/github/view_component/releases/tag/v2.49.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/github/view_component/security/advisories/GHSA-cm9w-c4rj-r2cf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
