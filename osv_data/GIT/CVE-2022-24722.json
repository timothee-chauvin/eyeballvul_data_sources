Versions prior to 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone using translations with the view_component gem. Data received via user input and passed as an interpolation argument to the `translate` method is not properly sanitized before display. Versions 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 have been released and fully mitigate the vulnerability. As a workaround, avoid passing user input to the `translate` function, or sanitize the inputs before passing them.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/viewcomponent/view_component","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3f82a6e62578ff6f361aba24a1feb2caccf83ff9"},{"fixed":"b8a5f4a97f78d60293f57aa12765a0f0007247d4"},{"fixed":"e3f065e3c8d47c73d98700040c0efdf4370181ad"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24722.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/github/view_component","events":[{"introduced":"73051f692acfcbe8f3535ef4952e1c1df2d86887"},{"fixed":"e3f065e3c8d47c73d98700040c0efdf4370181ad"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24722.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/github/view_component/commit/3f82a6e62578ff6f361aba24a1feb2caccf83ff9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/github/view_component/releases/tag/v2.31.2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/github/view_component/releases/tag/v2.49.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/github/view_component/security/advisories/GHSA-cm9w-c4rj-r2cf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
