{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-66448","published":"2025-12-01T22:45:42.566Z","modified":"2025-12-03T02:18:56.683167Z","aliases":["GHSA-8fr4-5q9j-m8gm"],"summary":"vLLM vulnerable to remote code execution via transformers_utils/get_config","details":"vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). Prior to 0.11.1, vllm has a critical remote code execution vector in a config class named Nemotron_Nano_VL_Config. When vllm loads a model config that contains an auto_map entry, the config class resolves that mapping with get_class_from_dynamic_module(...) and immediately instantiates the returned class. This fetches and executes Python from the remote repository referenced in the auto_map string. Crucially, this happens even when the caller explicitly sets trust_remote_code=False in vllm.transformers_utils.config.get_config. In practice, an attacker can publish a benign-looking frontend repo whose config.json points via auto_map to a separate malicious backend repo; loading the frontend will silently run the backend’s code on the victim host. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.11.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"439368496db48d8f992ba8c606a0c0b1eebbfa69"}]}],"versions":["submission","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.10.0","v0.10.0rc1","v0.10.0rc2","v0.10.1rc1","v0.10.2rc1","v0.10.2rc2","v0.11.0rc1","v0.11.1rc0","v0.11.1rc1","v0.11.1rc2","v0.11.1rc3","v0.11.1rc4","v0.11.1rc5","v0.11.1rc6","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.4.0","v0.4.0.post1","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.5.0","v0.5.0.post1","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.3.post1","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.1.post1","v0.6.1.post2","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.3.post1","v0.6.4","v0.6.4.post1","v0.6.5","v0.6.6","v0.6.6.post1","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.8.0rc1","v0.8.0rc2","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3rc1","v0.8.4","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.1rc1","v0.9.1rc2","v0.9.2rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66448.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/ffb08379d8870a1a81ba82b72797f196838d0c86"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/28126"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-8fr4-5q9j-m8gm"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
