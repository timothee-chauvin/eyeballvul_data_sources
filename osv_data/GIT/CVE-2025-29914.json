Prior to 3.3.3, if a request is made on an URI starting with //, coraza will set a wrong value in REQUEST_FILENAME. For example, if the URI //bar/uploads/foo.php?a=b is passed to coraza: , REQUEST_FILENAME will be set to /uploads/foo.php. This can lead to a rules bypass. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.3.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4722c9ad0d502abd56b8d6733c6b47eb4111742d"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.0-beta.1","v1.0.0-beta.2","v1.0.0-beta.3","v1.0.0-beta.4","v1.0.0-beta.5","v1.0.0-beta.6","v1.0.0-beta.7","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha.1","v2.0.0-beta.2","v2.0.0-beta.3","v2.0.0-beta.4","v2.0.0-beta.5","v2.0.0-beta.6","v2.0.0-rc.1","v2.0.0-rc.2","v2.0.0-rc.3","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-rc.1","v3.0.0-rc.2","v3.0.0-rc.3","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-29914.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza/commit/4722c9ad0d502abd56b8d6733c6b47eb4111742d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza/security/advisories/GHSA-q9f5-625g-xm39"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-706"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
