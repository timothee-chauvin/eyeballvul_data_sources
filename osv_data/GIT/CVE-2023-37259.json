{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-37259","published":"2023-07-18T16:59:21Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:14:35.316251Z","aliases":["GHSA-c9vx-2g7w-rp65"],"related":["openSUSE-SU-2024:13054-1","openSUSE-SU-2024:13055-1"],"summary":"Cross site scripting in Export Chat feature","details":"matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. The Export Chat feature includes certain attacker-controlled elements in the generated document without sufficient escaping, leading to stored Cross site scripting (XSS). Since the Export Chat feature generates a separate document, an attacker can only inject code run from the `null` origin, restricting the impact. However, the attacker can still potentially use the XSS to leak message contents. A malicious homeserver is a potential attacker since the affected inputs are controllable server-side. This issue has been addressed in commit `22fcd34c60` which is included in release version 3.76.0. Users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable or to not use the Export Chat feature.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk","events":[{"introduced":"4ceb2a74cf44daf21322e25adcdf5ad6a72b5f8f"},{"fixed":"35c7df19aff56befd8d06980dfe79a699710a14e"}]}],"versions":["no-media-devices-release","v3.32.0","v3.32.1","v3.33.0","v3.33.0-rc.1","v3.33.0-rc.2","v3.34.0","v3.34.0-rc.1","v3.35.0","v3.35.0-rc.1","v3.35.1","v3.36.0","v3.36.0-rc.1","v3.36.1","v3.37.0","v3.37.0-rc.1","v3.38.0","v3.38.0-rc.1","v3.39.0","v3.39.0-rc.1","v3.39.0-rc.2","v3.39.1","v3.40.0","v3.40.0-rc.1","v3.40.0-rc.2","v3.40.1","v3.41.0","v3.41.0-rc.1","v3.41.1","v3.42.0","v3.42.0-rc.1","v3.42.1","v3.42.1-rc.1","v3.42.2-rc.1","v3.42.3","v3.42.4","v3.43.0","v3.43.0-rc.1","v3.44.0","v3.44.0-rc.1","v3.44.0-rc.2","v3.45.0","v3.45.0-rc.1","v3.45.0-rc.2","v3.45.0-rc.3","v3.46.0","v3.46.0-rc.1","v3.47.0","v3.48.0","v3.48.0-rc.1","v3.49.0","v3.49.0-rc.1","v3.49.0-rc.2","v3.50.0","v3.51.0","v3.51.0-rc.1","v3.52.0","v3.52.0-rc.1","v3.52.0-rc.2","v3.53.0","v3.53.0-rc.1","v3.53.0-rc.2","v3.54.0","v3.54.0-rc.1","v3.55.0","v3.55.0-rc.1","v3.56.0","v3.57.0","v3.58.0","v3.58.0-rc.1","v3.58.0-rc.2","v3.58.1","v3.59.0","v3.59.0-rc.1","v3.59.0-rc.2","v3.59.1","v3.60.0","v3.60.0-rc.1","v3.60.0-rc.2","v3.61.0","v3.61.0-rc.1","v3.62.0","v3.62.0-rc.1","v3.62.0-rc.2","v3.63.0","v3.63.0-rc.1","v3.63.0-rc.2","v3.64.0","v3.64.0-rc.1","v3.64.0-rc.2","v3.64.0-rc.3","v3.64.0-rc.4","v3.64.1","v3.64.2","v3.65.0","v3.65.0-rc.1","v3.66.0","v3.66.0-rc.1","v3.67.0","v3.67.0-rc.1","v3.67.0-rc.2","v3.68.0","v3.68.0-rc.1","v3.68.0-rc.2","v3.68.0-rc.3","v3.69.0","v3.69.1","v3.70.0","v3.70.0-rc.1","v3.71.0","v3.71.0-rc.1","v3.71.1","v3.72.0","v3.72.0-rc.1","v3.72.0-rc.2","v3.73.0","v3.73.0-rc.1","v3.73.0-rc.2","v3.73.0-rc.3","v3.73.1","v3.74.0","v3.74.0-rc1","v3.75.0","v3.75.0-no-media-devices-hotfix","v3.75.0-rc.1","v3.76.0-rc.1","v3.76.0-rc.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-37259.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/commit/22fcd34c606f32129ebc967fc21f24fb708a98b8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-c9vx-2g7w-rp65"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
