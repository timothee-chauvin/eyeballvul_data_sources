In versions 2.22.0 through 2.24.3, 2.25.0  and 2.25.1, Coder can be compromised through insecure session handling in prebuilt workspaces. Coder automatically generates a session token for a user when a workspace is started. It is automatically exposed via coder_workspace_owner.session_token. Prebuilt workspaces are initially owned by a built-in prebuilds system user. When a prebuilt workspace is claimed, a new session token is generated for the user that claimed the workspace, but the previous session token for the prebuilds user was not expired. Any Coder workspace templates that persist this automatically generated session token are potentially impacted. This is fixed in versions 2.24.4 and 2.25.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/coder/coder","events":[{"introduced":"b568aa74165a698ebfb1ef85938560510a43f8b0"},{"fixed":"ecc6d536bac21fda59dd720f7adb48fa8ed73b2b"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.22.0"},{"fixed":"2.24.4"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/coder/coder","events":[{"introduced":"e6ec95757ab9772b1f5f1ed8a49e6d2640927318"},{"fixed":"f51e22da5caeae6be27dfe08e8ef98f9e1e838fa"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.25.0"},{"fixed":"2.25.2"}]}}],"versions":["v2.25.0","v2.25.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58437.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/58xxx/CVE-2025-58437.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/coder/coder/commit/06cbb2890f453cd522bb2158a6549afa3419c276"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/coder/coder/commit/20d67d7d7191a4fd5d36a61c6fc1e23ab59befc0"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/coder/coder/commit/ec660907faa0b0eae20fa2ba58ce1733f5f4b35a"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/coder/coder/pull/19667"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/coder/coder/pull/19668"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/coder/coder/pull/19669"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/coder/coder/security/advisories/GHSA-j6xf-jwrj-v5qp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58437"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-277","CWE-279","CWE-613"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/58xxx/CVE-2025-58437.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
