Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mozilla/hawk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"44957bb34aae9ab9f7b6780876f951ea1983a3b2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-29167.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/security/advisories/GHSA-44pw-h2cw-w3vq"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/pull/286"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
