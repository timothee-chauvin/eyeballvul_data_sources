For preallocated htab map, these fields are\ninitialized through __GFP_ZERO in bpf_map_area_alloc(), so do the\nsimilar thing for non-preallocated htab in bpf memory allocator. And\nthere is no need to use __GFP_ZERO for per-cpu bpf memory allocator,\nbecause __alloc_percpu_gfp() does it implicitly.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0fd7c5d43339b783ee3301a05f925d1e52ac87c9"},{"fixed":"678ea18d6240299fd77d7000c8b1d7e5f274c8af"},{"fixed":"5d447e04290e78bdc1a3a6c321320d384e09c2f1"},{"fixed":"997849c4b969034e225153f41026657def66d286"}]}],"versions":["v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.2.1","v6.2.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53790.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.1.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.16"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53790.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5d447e04290e78bdc1a3a6c321320d384e09c2f1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/678ea18d6240299fd77d7000c8b1d7e5f274c8af"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/997849c4b969034e225153f41026657def66d286"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53790.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53790"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53790.json"}}
