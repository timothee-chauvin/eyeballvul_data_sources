This resulted in memory corruption and crashes eventually.\nUnfortunately it's a void pointer, hence the compiler couldn't know\nthat it's wrong.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"4fe238513407d83f38bf5782e8bcdd7b8baeb85d"},{"fixed":"2812815aa79637d39d4398ecd7e58f65d1c79231"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"4fe238513407d83f38bf5782e8bcdd7b8baeb85d"},{"fixed":"3f4422e7c9436abf81a00270be7e4d6d3760ec0e"}]}],"versions":["v6.15","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.16.1","v6.16.2","v6.16.3","v6.17-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39696.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39696.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2812815aa79637d39d4398ecd7e58f65d1c79231"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3f4422e7c9436abf81a00270be7e4d6d3760ec0e"}]}
