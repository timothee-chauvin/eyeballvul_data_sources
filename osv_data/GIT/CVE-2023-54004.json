__sk_mem_raise_allocated().","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nudplite: Fix NULL pointer dereference in __sk_mem_raise_allocated().\n\nsyzbot reported [0] a null-ptr-deref in sk_get_rmem0() while using\nIPPROTO_UDPLITE (0x88):\n\n  14:25:52 executing program 1:\n  r0 = socket$inet6(0xa, 0x80002, 0x88)\n\nWe had a similar report [1] for probably sk_memory_allocated_add()\nin __sk_mem_raise_allocated(), and commit c915fe13cbaa (\"udplite: fix\nNULL pointer dereference\") fixed it by setting .memory_allocated for\nudplite_prot and udplitev6_prot.\n\nTo fix the variant, we need to set either .sysctl_wmem_offset or\n.sysctl_rmem.\n\nNow UDP and UDPLITE share the same value for .memory_allocated, so we\nuse the same .sysctl_wmem_offset for UDP and UDPLITE.\n\n[0]:\ngeneral protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000000: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN\nKASAN: null-ptr-deref in range
