Versions prior to 0.4.5 were found to lack rate limiting on authentication views which allows brute-force attacks. This issue has been patched in version 0.4.5.

Users unable to upgrade may update their nginx.conf files with the changes manually.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"580745bee365b646de7be5b6ad13ad6818efcecc"}]}],"versions":["0.4.2","v0.0.1","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35925.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/35xxx/CVE-2022-35925.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/security/advisories/GHSA-jvp3-mqv8-5rjw"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://huntr.dev/bounties/ebee593d-3fd0-4985-bf5e-7e7927e08bf6/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35925"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/commit/7bbe42fb30a79a26115524d18b697d895563c92f"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-287"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/35xxx/CVE-2022-35925.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
