If those \nrewrite rules effectively enforced security constraints, those \nconstraints could be bypassed.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.5, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.39, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.102.\nThe following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are \nknown to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions \nmay also be affected.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version [FIXED_VERSION], which fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/tomcat","events":[{"introduced":"16bf392c67833ad549733b58c350ff92b5ee782a"},{"fixed":"f8cfae0a0d1c8dc592099a1430cd08e352430823"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-31651.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.apache.org/list.html?announce@tomcat.apache.org"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/04/28/3"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
