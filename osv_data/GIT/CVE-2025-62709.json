{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62709","published":"2025-11-20T16:50:03.193Z","modified":"2025-11-27T13:19:23.595363Z","aliases":["GHSA-xhhf-mpqr-2cq5"],"summary":"ClipBucket v5 is vulnerable to password reset link manipulation","details":"ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. In ClipBucket version 5.5.2, a change to network.class.php causes the application to dynamically build the server URL from the incoming HTTP Host header when the configuration base_url is not set. Because Host is a client-controlled header, an attacker can supply an arbitrary Host value. This allows an attacker to cause password-reset links (sent by forget.php) to be generated with the attacker’s domain. If a victim follows that link and enters their activation code on the attacker-controlled domain, the attacker can capture the code and use it to reset the victim’s password and take over the account. This issue has been patched in version 5.5.2#162.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/macwarrior/clipbucket-v5","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1a93532e665217b5d329808ca78e37e59e9f8a9d"}]}],"versions":["5.3","5.3.1","5.4.0","5.4.1","5.5.0","5.5.1","5.5.2-#103","5.5.2-#106","5.5.2-#114","5.5.2-#117","5.5.2-#120","5.5.2-#123","5.5.2-#129","5.5.2-#133","5.5.2-#135","5.5.2-#25","5.5.2-#38","5.5.2-#4","5.5.2-#45","5.5.2-#58","5.5.2-#69","5.5.2-#74","5.5.2-#82","5.5.2-#86","5.5.2-#90","5.5.2-#98"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62709.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/commit/1a93532e665217b5d329808ca78e37e59e9f8a9d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-xhhf-mpqr-2cq5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-640"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
