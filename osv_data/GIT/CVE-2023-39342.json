The Dangerzone CLI (`dangerzone-cli` command) logs output from the container where the file sanitization takes place, to the user's terminal. Prior to version 0.4.2, if the container is compromised and can return attacker-controlled strings, then the attacker may be able to spoof messages in the user's terminal or change the window title. Besides logging output from containers, it also logs the names of the files it sanitizes. If these files contain ANSI escape sequences, then the same issue applies. Dangerzone is predominantly a GUI application, so this issue should leave most of our users unaffected. Nevertheless, we always suggest updating to the newest version. This issue is fixed in Dangerzone 0.4.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1837c826a69f7f550f86188a81e5e09de6d82a08"}]}],"versions":["dev-v0.3.2-rc1","dev-v0.3.2-rc2","dev-v0.3.2-rc3","dev-v0.3.dev1","v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.1","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.2","v0.2.1","v0.3","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.dev1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.1-rc1","v0.4.1-rc2","v0.4.1-rc3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-39342.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/security/advisories/GHSA-pvwq-6vpp-2632"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/pull/491"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/releases/tag/v0.4.2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-150"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
