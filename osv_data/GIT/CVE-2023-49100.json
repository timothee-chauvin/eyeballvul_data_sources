{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-49100","published":"2024-02-21T16:15:49.457Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:21:38.374493Z","details":"Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A) before 2.10 has a potential read out-of-bounds in the SDEI service. The input parameter passed in register x1 is not validated well enough in the function sdei_interrupt_bind. The parameter is passed to a call to plat_ic_get_interrupt_type. It can be any arbitrary value passing checks in the function plat_ic_is_sgi. A compromised Normal World (Linux kernel) can enable a root-privileged attacker to issue arbitrary SMC calls. Using this primitive, he can control the content of registers x0 through x6, which are used to send parameters to TF-A. Out-of-bounds addresses can be read in the context of TF-A (EL3). Because the read value is never returned to non-secure memory or in registers, no leak is possible. An attacker can still crash TF-A, however.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/arm-software/arm-trusted-firmware","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b6c0948400594e3cc4dbb5a4ef04b815d2675808"}]}],"versions":["for-v0.4-rc0","v0.2","v0.3","v0.4","v0.4-rc1","v0.4-rc2","v1.0","v1.0-rc0","v1.1","v1.1-rc0","v1.1-rc1","v1.1-rc2","v1.1-rc3","v1.2","v1.2-rc0","v1.3","v1.3-rc0","v1.3_rc1","v1.3_rc2","v1.4","v1.4-rc0","v1.5","v1.5-rc0","v1.5-rc1","v1.5-rc2","v1.5-rc3","v1.6","v1.6-rc0","v1.6-rc1","v2.0","v2.0-rc0","v2.1","v2.1-rc0","v2.1-rc1","v2.10-rc0","v2.10-rc1","v2.2","v2.2-rc0","v2.2-rc1","v2.2-rc2","v2.3","v2.3-rc0","v2.3-rc1","v2.3-rc2","v2.4","v2.4-rc0","v2.4-rc1","v2.4-rc2","v2.5","v2.5-rc0","v2.5-rc1","v2.6","v2.6-rc0","v2.6-rc1","v2.7","v2.7-rc0","v2.7-rc1","v2.7.0","v2.8","v2.8-rc0","v2.8.0","v2.9","v2.9-rc0","v2.9-rc1","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-49100.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/a05414bedc9b1cc35cf0795ce641b6b4db5bc97e/services/std_svc/sdei/sdei_main.c#L708"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/a05414bedc9b1cc35cf0795ce641b6b4db5bc97e/services/std_svc/sdei/sdei_main.c#L714"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security_advisories/security-advisory-tfv-11.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
