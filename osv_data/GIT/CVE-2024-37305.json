Flaws have been identified in the way oqs-provider handles lengths decoded with DECODE_UINT32 at the start of serialized hybrid (traditional + post-quantum) keys and signatures. Unchecked length values are later used for memory reads and writes; malformed input can lead to crashes or information leakage. Handling of plain/non-hybrid PQ key operation is not affected. This issue has been patched in in v0.6.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c4130ea3ae14f8adfb08235d0d7c5c5a3470666b"}]}],"versions":["0.3.0","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.5.1-rc1","0.5.2","0.6.0","0.6.0-rc1","0.6.1-rc1","ietf116","openssl-3.0.0-alpha12-liboqs-0.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-37305.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/security/advisories/GHSA-pqvr-5cr8-v6fx"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/416"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-120","CWE-130","CWE-190","CWE-680","CWE-805"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H"}]}
