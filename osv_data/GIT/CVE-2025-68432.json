{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68432","published":"2025-12-17T22:45:42.228Z","modified":"2025-12-18T21:44:55.599647Z","aliases":["GHSA-29cp-2hmh-hcxj"],"summary":"Zed IDE LSP Binary Configuration Arbitrary Code Execution","details":"Zed, a code editor, has an aribtrary code execution vulnerability in versions prior to 0.218.2-pre. The Zed IDE loads Language Server Protocol (LSP) configurations from the `settings.json` file located within a project’s `.zed` subdirectory. A malicious LSP configuration can contain arbitrary shell commands that run on the host system with the privileges of the user running the IDE. This can be triggered when a user opens project file for which there is an LSP entry.  A concerted effort by an attacker to seed a project settings file (`./zed/settings.json`) with malicious language server configurations could result in arbitrary code execution with the user's privileges if the user opens the project in Zed without reviewing the contents. Version 0.218.2-pre fixes the issue by implementing worktree trust mechanism. As a workaround, users should carefully review the contents of project settings files (`./zed/settings.json`) before opening new projects in Zed.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zed-industries/zed","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d00da08950b357874097cf3d7c8bb86c62bb93cf"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.218.2-pre"}]}}],"versions":["benchmark-m4","collab-v0.10.0","collab-v0.11.0","collab-v0.12.0","collab-v0.12.1","collab-v0.12.3","collab-v0.12.4","collab-v0.12.5","collab-v0.13.0","collab-v0.13.1","collab-v0.14.0","collab-v0.14.1","collab-v0.14.2","collab-v0.15.0","collab-v0.16.0","collab-v0.17.0","collab-v0.18.0","collab-v0.19.0","collab-v0.2.0","collab-v0.2.1","collab-v0.2.2","collab-v0.2.3","collab-v0.2.4","collab-v0.2.5","collab-v0.20.0","collab-v0.21.0","collab-v0.22.0","collab-v0.22.1","collab-v0.23.0","collab-v0.23.1","collab-v0.23.2","collab-v0.23.3","collab-v0.24.0","collab-v0.25.0","collab-v0.26.0","collab-v0.27.0","collab-v0.28.0","collab-v0.29.0","collab-v0.29.1","collab-v0.3.0","collab-v0.3.1","collab-v0.3.10","collab-v0.3.11","collab-v0.3.12","collab-v0.3.13","collab-v0.3.14","collab-v0.3.2","collab-v0.3.3","collab-v0.3.4","collab-v0.3.5","collab-v0.3.6","collab-v0.3.7","collab-v0.3.8","collab-v0.3.9","collab-v0.30.0","collab-v0.30.1","collab-v0.31.0","collab-v0.32.0","collab-v0.33.0","collab-v0.34.0","collab-v0.35.0","collab-v0.36.0","collab-v0.36.1","collab-v0.37.0","collab-v0.38.0","collab-v0.39.0","collab-v0.4.0","collab-v0.4.1","collab-v0.4.2","collab-v0.40.0","collab-v0.40.1","collab-v0.41.0","collab-v0.42.0","collab-v0.42.1","collab-v0.43.0","collab-v0.44.0","collab-v0.5.0","collab-v0.5.1","collab-v0.5.2","collab-v0.5.3","collab-v0.5.4","collab-v0.6.0","collab-v0.6.1","collab-v0.6.2","collab-v0.7.0","collab-v0.7.1","collab-v0.7.2","collab-v0.8.0","collab-v0.8.1","collab-v0.8.2","collab-v0.8.3","collab-v0.9.0","extension-cli","nightly-1","v0.1","v0.10","v0.10.1","v0.11","v0.11.0","v0.12","v0.13","v0.13.1","v0.14","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.16.0","v0.17.0","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.19.0","v0.2","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.20","v0.20.0","v0.21.0","v0.218.0-pre","v0.218.1-pre","v0.22.0","v0.23.0","v0.24.0","v0.24.1","v0.25.0","v0.26.0","v0.27.0","v0.28.0","v0.28.1","v0.29.0","v0.3","v0.3.1","v0.30.0","v0.31.0","v0.32.0","v0.33.0","v0.34.0","v0.35.0","v0.36.0","v0.36.1","v0.37.0","v0.38.0","v0.39.0","v0.4","v0.40.0","v0.41.0","v0.42.0","v0.43.0","v0.44.0","v0.44.1","v0.45.0","v0.46.0","v0.47.0","v0.47.1","v0.48.0","v0.48.1","v0.49.0","v0.49.1","v0.5","v0.50.0","v0.51.0","v0.51.1","v0.52.0","v0.53.0","v0.53.1","v0.54.0","v0.54.1","v0.55.0","v0.56.0","v0.57.0","v0.58.0","v0.59.0","v0.6","v0.60.0","v0.60.1","v0.60.2","v0.60.3","v0.60.4","v0.61.0","v0.7","v0.8.0","v0.9","vConradTest"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68432.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68432.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/security/advisories/GHSA-29cp-2hmh-hcxj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68432"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://zed.dev/blog/secure-by-default"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-77"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68432.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
