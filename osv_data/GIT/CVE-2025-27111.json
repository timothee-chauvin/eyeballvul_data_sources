The Rack::Sendfile middleware logs unsanitised header values from the X-Sendfile-Type header. An attacker can exploit this by injecting escape sequences (such as newline characters) into the header, resulting in log injection. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.12, 3.0.13, and 3.1.11.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rack/rack","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"78296637d7b35dcd357a64e8c76bd7f664c1cdbf"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.2.12"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rack/rack","events":[{"introduced":"52901caf09ebcda879512a8605059963a49df55d"},{"fixed":"ef96f4aa2f6f670233eca3e9bc780809914dd93b"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.0"},{"fixed":"3.0.13"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rack/rack","events":[{"introduced":"606365ba1353cbffdf94422c20166dc2e6d6286d"},{"fixed":"c827c3324827f3aefe73f0800d1a717c0c15537b"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.1"},{"fixed":"3.1.11"}]}}],"versions":["0.1","0.2","0.3","1.0","1.1","1.2","1.2.1","1.3.0","1.3.0.beta","1.3.0.beta2","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.6.0","1.6.0.beta","1.6.0.beta2","2.0.0","2.0.0.alpha","2.0.0.rc1","2.0.1","2.1.0","2.2.0","2.2.3","2.2.3.1","2.2.4","3.0.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.10","v2.2.11","v2.2.2","v2.2.5","v2.2.6","v2.2.6.1","v2.2.6.2","v2.2.6.3","v2.2.6.4","v2.2.7","v2.2.8","v2.2.8.1","v2.2.9","v3.0.1","v3.0.10","v3.0.12","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.4.1","v3.0.4.2","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.6.1","v3.0.7","v3.0.8","v3.0.9","v3.0.9.1","v3.1.0","v3.1.10","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.1.4","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.1.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27111.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/803aa221e8302719715e224f4476e438f2531a53"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/aeac570bb8080ca7b53b7f2e2f67498be7ebd30b"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/b13bc6bfc7506aca3478dc5ac1c2ec6fc53f82a3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-8cgq-6mh2-7j6v"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/03/msg00016.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-117","CWE-93"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
