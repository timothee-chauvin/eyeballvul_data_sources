{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-66581","published":"2025-12-05T18:26:20.622Z","modified":"2025-12-12T02:58:22.576742Z","aliases":["GHSA-2ch7-c74m-432m"],"summary":"Frappe LMS is Missing Server-Side Authorization in Business Logic","details":"Frappe Learning Management System (LMS) is a learning system that helps users structure their content. Prior to 2.41.0, a flaw in the server-side authorization logic allowed authenticated users to perform actions beyond their assigned roles across multiple features. Because the affected endpoints relied on client-side or UI-level checks instead of enforcing permissions on the server, users with low-privileged roles (such as students) could perform operations intended only for instructors or administrators via directly using the API's. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.41.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/frappe/lms","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"87a7b933342084132240f8911c16bfa9445403e6"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.1.0","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.12.0","v2.13.0","v2.14.0","v2.15.0","v2.16.0","v2.17.0","v2.18.0","v2.19.0","v2.2.0","v2.20.0","v2.21.0","v2.22.0","v2.23.0","v2.24.0","v2.25.0","v2.26.0","v2.27.0","v2.28.0","v2.28.1","v2.29.0","v2.3.0","v2.30.0","v2.31.0","v2.32.0","v2.32.1","v2.32.2","v2.33.0","v2.34.0","v2.34.1","v2.35.0","v2.36.0","v2.37.0","v2.38.0","v2.39.0","v2.39.1","v2.39.2","v2.4.0","v2.40.0","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66581.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66581.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/frappe/lms/security/advisories/GHSA-2ch7-c74m-432m"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66581"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-863"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66581.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
