{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-65563","published":"2025-12-18T19:16:33.850Z","modified":"2026-01-09T07:59:17.706124Z","details":"A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the omec-project UPF (component upf-epc/pfcpiface) up to at least version upf-epc-pfcpiface:2.1.3-dev. When the UPF receives a PFCP Association Setup Request that is missing the mandatory NodeID Information Element, the association setup handler dereferences a nil pointer instead of validating the message, causing a panic and terminating the UPF process. An attacker who can send PFCP Association Setup Request messages to the UPF's N4/PFCP endpoint can exploit this issue to repeatedly crash the UPF and disrupt user-plane services.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/omec-project/upf","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0a494e3d2f9b59d912e6dc37d4e8b3789776959b"}]}],"versions":["v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65563.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/omec-project/upf/issues/955"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/omec-project/upf/pull/963"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
