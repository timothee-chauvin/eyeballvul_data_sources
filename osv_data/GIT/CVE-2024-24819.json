{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-24819","published":"2024-02-09T00:11:11Z","modified":"2025-10-21T19:33:45Z","aliases":["GHSA-p8vv-9pqq-rm8p"],"summary":"icingaweb2-module-incubator base implementation for HTML forms is susceptible to CSRF","details":"icingaweb2-module-incubator is a working project of bleeding edge Icinga Web 2 libraries. In affected versions the class `gipfl\\Web\\Form` is the base for various concrete form implementations [1] and provides protection against cross site request forgery (CSRF) by default. This is done by automatically adding an element with a CSRF token to any form, unless explicitly disabled, but even if enabled, the CSRF token (sent during a client's submission of a form relying on it) is not validated. This enables attackers to perform changes on behalf of a user which, unknowingly, interacts with a prepared link or website. The version 0.22.0 is available to remedy this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/icinga/icingaweb2-module-incubator","events":[{"introduced":"2ff5465a9a77caab83d5fee625523437f3dafc46"},{"fixed":"74afd948165048ab0712ec08121069b68301624a"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-24819.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-incubator/security/advisories/GHSA-p8vv-9pqq-rm8p"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-incubator/commit/db7dc49585fee0b4e96be666d7f6009a74a1ccb5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/search?q=gipfl%5CWeb%5CForm%3B&type=code"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-352"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L"}]}
