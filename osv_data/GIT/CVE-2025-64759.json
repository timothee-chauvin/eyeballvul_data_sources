Prior to version 1.43.3, stored XSS vulnerability exists, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser, with minimal or no user interaction required, due to the rendering of a malicious uploaded SVG file. This could be abused to add an attacker's account to the \"credentials-admin\" group, giving them full administrative access, if a user logged in as an administrator was to view the page which renders or redirects to the SVG. This issue has been patched in version 1.43.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/homarr-labs/homarr","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0bba7be8d5a27276641700ce310b3c270f8b1aa7"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-beta.1","v1.0.0-beta.10","v1.0.0-beta.11","v1.0.0-beta.12","v1.0.0-beta.2","v1.0.0-beta.3","v1.0.0-beta.4","v1.0.0-beta.5","v1.0.0-beta.6","v1.0.0-beta.7","v1.0.0-beta.8","v1.0.0-beta.9","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.17.0","v1.18.0","v1.18.1","v1.19.0","v1.19.1","v1.2.0","v1.20.0","v1.21.0","v1.22.0","v1.23.0","v1.24.0","v1.25.0","v1.26.0","v1.27.0","v1.28.0","v1.28.1","v1.29.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.30.0","v1.30.1","v1.31.0","v1.32.0","v1.33.0","v1.34.0","v1.35.0","v1.35.1","v1.36.0","v1.36.1","v1.37.0","v1.38.0","v1.39.0","v1.4.0","v1.40.0","v1.41.0","v1.42.0","v1.42.1","v1.43.0","v1.43.1","v1.43.2","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64759.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/homarr-labs/homarr/commit/aaa23f37321be1e110f722b36889b2fd3bea2059"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/homarr-labs/homarr/security/advisories/GHSA-wj62-c5gr-2x53"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20","CWE-434"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
