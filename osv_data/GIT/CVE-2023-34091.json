In versions of Kyverno prior to 1.10.0, resources which have the `deletionTimestamp` field defined can bypass validate, generate, or mutate-existing policies, even in cases where the `validationFailureAction` field is set to `Enforce`. This situation occurs as resources pending deletion were being consciously exempted by Kyverno, as a way to reduce processing load as policies are typically not applied to objects which are being deleted. However, this could potentially result in allowing a malicious user to leverage the Kubernetes finalizers feature by setting a finalizer which causes the Kubernetes API server to set the `deletionTimestamp` and then not completing the delete operation as a way to explicitly to bypass a Kyverno policy. Note that this is not applicable to Kubernetes Pods but, as an example, a Kubernetes Service resource can be manipulated using an indefinite finalizer to bypass policies. This is resolved in Kyverno 1.10.0. There is no known workaround.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"da6f5c18132f773af15d0e09cbf2e16a36725232"}]}],"versions":["1.3.0-rc10","1.6-dev","1.7-dev","1.8-dev","1.9-dev","helm-chart-v2.0.3","helm-chart-v2.0.3-rc1","helm-chart-v2.0.3-rc2","helm-chart-v2.1.0","helm-chart-v2.1.3","kyverno-chart-3.0.0-alpha.1","kyverno-chart-3.0.0-alpha.2","kyverno-chart-3.0.0-beta.1","kyverno-chart-3.0.0-rc.1","kyverno-policies-chart-3.0.0-alpha.1","kyverno-policies-chart-3.0.0-alpha.2","kyverno-policies-chart-3.0.0-beta.1","kyverno-policies-chart-3.0.0-rc.1","test-dev","v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.10","v1.1.11","v1.1.12","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.3-rc1","v1.1.4","v1.1.4-rc1","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.6-rc1","v1.1.6-rc2","v1.1.6-rc3","v1.1.6-rc4","v1.1.6-rc5","v1.1.7","v1.1.7-rc1","v1.1.7-rc2","v1.1.7-rc3","v1.1.7-rc4","v1.1.8","v1.1.9","v1.10.0-alpha.1","v1.10.0-alpha.2","v1.10.0-beta.1","v1.10.0-rc.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.3.0-rc10","v1.3.0-rc11","v1.3.0-rc12","v1.3.0-rc2","v1.3.0-rc3","v1.3.0-rc4","v1.3.0-rc5","v1.3.0-rc6","v1.3.0-rc7","v1.3.0-rc8","v1.3.0-rc9","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.2-rc1","v1.3.2-rc2","v1.3.2-rc3","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.4-rc1","v1.3.5","v1.3.5-rc1","v1.3.5-rc2","v1.3.5-rc3","v1.3.5-rc4","v1.3.5-rc5","v1.3.6","v1.3.6-rc1","v1.3.6-rc2","v1.3.6-rc3","v1.3.6-rc4","v1.3.6-rc5","v1.4.0","v1.4.0-rc1","v1.4.0-rc2","v1.4.0-rc3","v1.4.0-rc4","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.2-rc1","v1.4.2-rc2","v1.4.2-rc3","v1.4.2-rc4","v1.4.3","v1.4.3-rc1","v1.4.3-rc2","v1.5.0-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-34091.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/releases/tag/v1.10.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/security/advisories/GHSA-hq4m-4948-64cc"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-285"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
