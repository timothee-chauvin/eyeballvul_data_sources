The server exposes an endpoint that is vulnerable to OS command injection. This allows unauthenticated network attackers to send a POST request to the server and run arbitrary executables. On Windows, the attackers can also execute arbitrary shell commands with fully controlled arguments.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/react-native-community/cli","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15089907d1f1301b22c72d7f68846a2ef20df547"}]}],"versions":["2.0.1","@react-native-community/cli@1.2.0","@react-native-community/cli@1.2.2","@react-native-community/cli@1.2.3","@react-native-community/cli@1.2.4","@react-native-community/cli@1.3.0","@react-native-community/cli@1.3.1","@react-native-community/cli@1.3.2","@react-native-community/cli@1.4.3","@react-native-community/cli@1.4.4","react-native-cli@2.0.1","react-native-cli@2.0.2","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.5","v10.0.0","v10.0.0-alpha.0","v10.0.0-alpha.1","v10.0.0-alpha.2","v10.0.0-alpha.3","v10.0.0-alpha.4","v10.0.0-alpha.5","v10.1.0","v10.1.1","v10.1.2","v10.1.3","v11.0.0","v11.0.0-11.0.0-alpha.1.0","v11.0.0-alpha.0","v11.0.0-alpha.1","v11.0.0-alpha.2","v11.0.1","v11.0.2","v11.1.0","v11.1.1","v12.0.0","v12.0.0-alpha.0","v12.0.0-alpha.1","v12.0.0-alpha.10","v12.0.0-alpha.11","v12.0.0-alpha.12","v12.0.0-alpha.13","v12.0.0-alpha.14","v12.0.0-alpha.15","v12.0.0-alpha.16","v12.0.0-alpha.17","v12.0.0-alpha.18","v12.0.0-alpha.2","v12.0.0-alpha.3","v12.0.0-alpha.4","v12.0.0-alpha.5","v12.0.0-alpha.6","v12.0.0-alpha.7","v12.0.0-alpha.8","v12.0.0-alpha.9","v12.1.0","v12.1.1","v12.2.0","v13.0.0","v13.0.1","v13.1.0","v13.2.0","v13.3.0","v13.4.0","v13.5.0","v13.5.1","v13.5.1-alpha.0","v13.5.2","v13.6.0","v13.6.1","v14.0.0","v14.0.0-alpha.0","v14.0.0-alpha.1","v14.0.0-alpha.10","v14.0.0-alpha.11","v14.0.0-alpha.12","v14.0.0-alpha.2","v14.0.0-alpha.3","v14.0.0-alpha.4","v14.0.0-alpha.5","v14.0.0-alpha.6","v14.0.0-alpha.7","v14.0.0-alpha.8","v14.0.0-alpha.9","v14.0.1","v14.1.0","v15.0.0","v15.0.0-alpha.0","v15.0.0-alpha.1","v15.0.0-alpha.2","v15.0.1","v15.0.1-alpha.0","v15.1.0","v15.1.1","v15.1.2","v16.0.0","v16.0.1","v16.0.2","v17.0.0","v18.0.0","v19.0.0","v19.0.0-alpha.0","v19.0.0-alpha.1","v19.0.0-alpha.2","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha.10","v2.0.0-alpha.11","v2.0.0-alpha.12","v2.0.0-alpha.13","v2.0.0-alpha.14","v2.0.0-alpha.15","v2.0.0-alpha.17","v2.0.0-alpha.18","v2.0.0-alpha.19","v2.0.0-alpha.20","v2.0.0-alpha.21","v2.0.0-alpha.22","v2.0.0-alpha.23","v2.0.0-alpha.4","v2.0.0-alpha.5","v2.0.0-alpha.6","v2.0.0-alpha.7","v2.0.0-alpha.8","v2.0.0-alpha.9","v2.0.0-rc.0","v2.0.0-rc.1","v2.0.0-rc.2","v2.0.0-rc.3","v2.0.0-rc.4","v2.0.0-rc.5","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.8.3","v20.0.0-alpha.0","v20.0.0-alpha.1","v20.0.0-alpha.2","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-alpha.1","v3.0.0-alpha.2","v3.0.0-alpha.3","v3.0.0-alpha.5","v3.0.0-alpha.6","v3.0.0-alpha.7","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5-alpha.0","v3.0.5-alpha.1","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.10.0","v4.10.1","v4.11.0","v4.12.0","v4.13.0","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.2.3","v4.2.4","v4.3.0","v4.4.0","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.6.0","v4.6.2","v4.7.0","v4.9.0","v5.0.0-alpha.0","v5.0.1-alpha.1","v5.0.1-alpha.2","v6.0.0","v6.0.0-rc.0","v6.0.1","v6.1.0","v6.2.0","v6.3.0","v6.3.1","v6.4.0","v7.0.1","v8.0.0","v8.0.0-alpha.0","v8.0.0-alpha.2","v8.0.0-alpha.3","v8.0.0-alpha.4","v8.0.0-alpha.5","v8.0.0-alpha.6","v8.0.0-alpha.trigger.4","v9.0.0","v9.0.0-alpha.0","v9.0.0-alpha.1","v9.0.0-alpha.10","v9.0.0-alpha.11","v9.0.0-alpha.12","v9.0.0-alpha.2","v9.0.0-alpha.3","v9.0.0-alpha.4","v9.0.0-alpha.5","v9.0.0-alpha.6","v9.0.0-alpha.7","v9.0.0-alpha.8","v9.0.0-alpha.9","v9.0.1","v9.1.0","v9.1.1","v9.1.2","v9.1.3","v9.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-11953.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://jfrog.com/blog/cve-2025-11953-critical-react-native-community-cli-vulnerability"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/commit/15089907d1f1301b22c72d7f68846a2ef20df547"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
