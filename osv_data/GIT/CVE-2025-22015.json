Namely, once it is in swap cache, folio->mapping should be\nNULL, and the folio is no longer in a shmem mapping.\n\nIn __folio_migrate_mapping(), to determine the number of xarray entries to\nupdate, folio_test_swapbacked() is used, but that conflates shmem in page\ncache case and shmem in swap cache case.  It leads to xarray multi-index\nentry corruption, since it turns a sibling entry to a normal entry during\nxas_store() (see [1] for a userspace reproduction).  Fix it by only using\nfolio_test_swapcache() to determine whether xarray is storing swap cache\nentries or not to choose the right number of xarray entries to update.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/Z8idPCkaJW1IChjT@casper.infradead.org/\n\nNote:\nIn __split_huge_page(), folio_test_anon() && folio_test_swapcache() is\nused to get swap_cache address space, but that ignores the shmem folio in\nswap cache case.  It could lead to NULL pointer dereferencing when a\nin-swap-cache shmem folio is split at __xa_store(), since\n!folio_test_anon() is true and folio->mapping is NULL.  But fortunately,\nits caller split_huge_page_to_list_to_order() bails out early with EBUSY\nwhen folio->mapping is NULL.  So no need to take care of it here.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"be72d197b2281e2ee3f28017fc9be1ab17e26d16"},{"fixed":"49100c0b070e900f87c8fac3be9b9ef8a30fa673"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"07550b1461d4d0499165e7d6f7718cfd0e440427"},{"fixed":"29124ae980e2860f0eec7355949d3d3292ee81da"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"fc346d0a70a13d52fe1c4bc49516d83a42cd7c4c"},{"fixed":"c057ee03f751d6cecf7ee64f52f6545d94082aaa"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"fc346d0a70a13d52fe1c4bc49516d83a42cd7c4c"},{"fixed":"75cfb92eb63298d717b6b0118f91ba12c4fcfeb5"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"fc346d0a70a13d52fe1c4bc49516d83a42cd7c4c"},{"fixed":"60cf233b585cdf1f3c5e52d1225606b86acd08b0"}]}],"versions":["v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.1.96","v6.1.97","v6.1.98","v6.1.99","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.13.1","v6.13.2","v6.13.3","v6.13.4","v6.13.5","v6.13.6","v6.13.7","v6.13.8","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.59","v6.6.60","v6.6.61","v6.6.62","v6.6.63","v6.6.64","v6.6.65","v6.6.66","v6.6.67","v6.6.68","v6.6.69","v6.6.70","v6.6.71","v6.6.72","v6.6.73","v6.6.74","v6.6.75","v6.6.76","v6.6.77","v6.6.78","v6.6.79","v6.6.80","v6.6.81","v6.6.82","v6.6.83","v6.6.84","v6.7","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-22015.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.132"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.85"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.21"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.13.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-22015.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/29124ae980e2860f0eec7355949d3d3292ee81da"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/49100c0b070e900f87c8fac3be9b9ef8a30fa673"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/60cf233b585cdf1f3c5e52d1225606b86acd08b0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/75cfb92eb63298d717b6b0118f91ba12c4fcfeb5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c057ee03f751d6cecf7ee64f52f6545d94082aaa"}]}
