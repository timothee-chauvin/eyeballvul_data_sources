KaTeX users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter malicious input using `\\def` or `\\newcommand` that causes a near-infinite loop, despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. KaTeX supports an option named maxExpand which aims to prevent infinitely recursive macros from consuming all available memory and/or triggering a stack overflow error. Unfortunately, support for \"Unicode (sub|super)script characters\" allows an attacker to bypass this limit. Each sub/superscript group instantiated a separate Parser with its own limit on macro executions, without inheriting the current count of macro executions from its parent. This has been corrected in KaTeX v0.16.10.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/katex/katex","events":[{"introduced":"575dab79f1772ab524fca3ca455f903e6195cb6e"},{"fixed":"ab323598fbf90a39c2c65bccd88f86b1ddfad931"}]}],"versions":["v0.15.4","v0.15.5","v0.15.6","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.16.3","v0.16.4","v0.16.5","v0.16.6","v0.16.7","v0.16.8","v0.16.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-28244.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/commit/085e21b5da05414efefa932570e7201a7c70e5b2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/security/advisories/GHSA-cvr6-37gx-v8wc"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-674"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
