[0]\n\nThe NULL pointer is sk->sk_user_data, and the offset 8 is of protocol\nin struct fou.\n\nWhen fou_release() is called due to netns dismantle or explicit tunnel\nteardown, udp_tunnel_sock_release() sets NULL to sk->sk_user_data.\nThen, the tunnel socket is destroyed after a single RCU grace period.\n\nSo, in-flight udp4_gro_receive() could find the socket and execute the\nFOU GRO handler, where sk->sk_user_data could be NULL.\n\nLet's use rcu_dereference_sk_user_data() in fou_from_sock() and add NULL\nchecks in FOU GRO handlers.\n\n[0]:\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer
