In version 1.4.0, a regression allowed folder visibility/ownership to be inferred from folder names. Low-privilege users could see or interact with folders matching their username and, in some cases, other usersâ€™ content. This issue has been patched in version 1.5.0, where it introduces explicit per-folder ACLs (owners/read/write/share/read_own) and strict server-side checks across list, read, write, share, rename, copy/move, zip, and WebDAV paths.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/error311/filerise","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b6d86b78967baa2f5a1e191903fc4df13998d87f"}]}],"versions":["1.4.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.13","v1.3.15","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62510.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/error311/FileRise/security/advisories/GHSA-jm96-2w52-5qjj"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/error311/FileRise/commit/b6d86b78967baa2f5a1e191903fc4df13998d87f"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/error311/FileRise/issues/55"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-280","CWE-284"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
