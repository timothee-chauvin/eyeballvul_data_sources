{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-40187","published":"2023-08-31T21:21:12Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:12:08.804762Z","aliases":["GHSA-pwf9-v5p9-ch4f"],"summary":"Use-After-Free in FreeRDP","details":"FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions of the 3.x beta branch are subject to a Use-After-Free issue in the `avc420_ensure_buffer` and `avc444_ensure_buffer` functions. If the value of `piDstSize[x]` is 0, `ppYUVDstData[x]` will be freed. However, in this case `ppYUVDstData[x]` will not have been updated which leads to a Use-After-Free vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in version 3.0.0-beta3. Users of the 3.x beta releases are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freerdp/freerdp","events":[{"introduced":"f468a06d88c55b9ed484757326a9528cf27d33f4"},{"fixed":"59a5726ab36338776539192cae2563951d0ce94b"}]}],"versions":["3.0.0-beta1","3.0.0-beta2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-40187.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/blob/5be5553e0da72178a4b94cc1ffbdace9ceb153e5/libfreerdp/codec/h264.c#L413-L427"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/security/advisories/GHSA-pwf9-v5p9-ch4f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-16"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-416"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
