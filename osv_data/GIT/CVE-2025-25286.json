{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-25286","published":"2025-02-13T00:36:55Z","modified":"2025-11-13T19:53:02.110884Z","aliases":["GHSA-mm6v-68qp-f9fw"],"summary":"Crayfish allows Remote Code Execution via Homarus Authorization header","details":"Crayfish is a collection of Islandora 8 microservices, one of which, Homarus, provides FFmpeg as a microservice. Prior to Crayfish version 4.1.0, remote code execution may be possible in web-accessible installations of Homarus in certain configurations. The issue has been patched in `islandora/crayfish:4.1.0`. Some workarounds are available. The exploit requires making a request against the Homarus's `/convert` endpoint; therefore, the ability to exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet, so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Homarus. Alternatively or additionally, configure auth in Crayfish to be more strongly required, such that requests with `Authorization` headers that do not validate are rejected before the problematic CLI interpolation occurs.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/islandora/crayfish","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a0b33d30db775171722cde7b46c1163c6660c5b9"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.10","0.0.11","0.0.12","0.0.13","0.0.14","0.0.15","0.0.2","0.0.3","0.0.4","0.0.5","0.0.6","0.0.7","0.0.8","0.0.9","0.1.0","0.2.0","0.2.1","1.0.0","2.0.0","3.0.0","4.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-25286.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/commit/64cb4cec688928798cc40e6f0a0e863d7f69fd89"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/security/advisories/GHSA-mm6v-68qp-f9fw"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-150","CWE-157"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
