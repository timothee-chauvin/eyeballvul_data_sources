{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68155","published":"2025-12-16T18:20:51.428Z","modified":"2025-12-20T15:34:55.571061Z","aliases":["GHSA-g239-q96q-x4qm"],"summary":"@vitejs/plugin-rsc has Arbitrary File Read via `/__vite_rsc_findSourceMapURL` Endpoint on Development","details":"@vitejs/plugin-rs provides React Server Components (RSC) support for Vite. Prior to version 0.5.8, the `/__vite_rsc_findSourceMapURL` endpoint in `@vitejs/plugin-rsc` allows unauthenticated arbitrary file read during development mode. An attacker can read any file accessible to the Node.js process by sending a crafted HTTP request with a `file://` URL in the `filename` query parameter. Version 0.5.8 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"604c3a24e319dc7e8aa8f2111e56d6fef4348cb6"}]}],"versions":["plugin-react-oxc@0.1.1","plugin-react-oxc@0.2.0","plugin-react-oxc@0.2.1","plugin-react-oxc@0.2.2","plugin-react-oxc@0.2.3","plugin-react-oxc@0.3.0","plugin-react-oxc@0.4.0","plugin-react-oxc@0.4.0-beta.0","plugin-react-oxc@0.4.1","plugin-react-oxc@0.4.2","plugin-react-oxc@0.4.3","plugin-react-swc@3.10.0","plugin-react-swc@3.10.1","plugin-react-swc@3.10.2","plugin-react-swc@3.11.0","plugin-react-swc@3.9.0","plugin-react-swc@3.9.0-beta.0","plugin-react-swc@3.9.0-beta.2","plugin-react-swc@3.9.0-beta.3","plugin-react-swc@4.0.0","plugin-react-swc@4.0.0-beta.0","plugin-react-swc@4.0.1","plugin-react-swc@4.1.0","plugin-react-swc@4.2.0","plugin-react-swc@4.2.1","plugin-react-swc@4.2.2","plugin-react@3.0.0","plugin-react@3.0.0-alpha.2","plugin-react@3.0.0-beta.0","plugin-react@3.0.1","plugin-react@3.1.0","plugin-react@3.1.0-beta.0","plugin-react@4.0.0","plugin-react@4.0.0-beta.0","plugin-react@4.0.0-beta.1","plugin-react@4.0.1","plugin-react@4.0.2","plugin-react@4.0.3","plugin-react@4.0.4","plugin-react@4.1.0","plugin-react@4.1.1","plugin-react@4.2.0","plugin-react@4.2.1","plugin-react@4.3.0","plugin-react@4.3.1","plugin-react@4.3.2","plugin-react@4.3.3","plugin-react@4.3.4","plugin-react@4.4.0","plugin-react@4.4.0-beta.0","plugin-react@4.4.0-beta.1","plugin-react@4.4.0-beta.2","plugin-react@4.4.1","plugin-react@4.5.0","plugin-react@4.5.1","plugin-react@4.5.2","plugin-react@4.6.0","plugin-react@4.7.0","plugin-react@5.0.0","plugin-react@5.0.0-beta.0","plugin-react@5.0.1","plugin-react@5.0.2","plugin-react@5.0.3","plugin-react@5.0.4","plugin-react@5.1.0","plugin-react@5.1.1","plugin-react@5.1.2","plugin-rsc@0.4.10","plugin-rsc@0.4.11","plugin-rsc@0.4.12","plugin-rsc@0.4.13","plugin-rsc@0.4.14","plugin-rsc@0.4.15","plugin-rsc@0.4.16","plugin-rsc@0.4.17","plugin-rsc@0.4.18","plugin-rsc@0.4.19","plugin-rsc@0.4.20","plugin-rsc@0.4.21","plugin-rsc@0.4.22","plugin-rsc@0.4.23","plugin-rsc@0.4.24","plugin-rsc@0.4.25","plugin-rsc@0.4.26","plugin-rsc@0.4.27","plugin-rsc@0.4.28","plugin-rsc@0.4.29","plugin-rsc@0.4.30","plugin-rsc@0.4.31","plugin-rsc@0.4.32","plugin-rsc@0.4.33","plugin-rsc@0.4.34","plugin-rsc@0.5.0","plugin-rsc@0.5.1","plugin-rsc@0.5.2","plugin-rsc@0.5.3","plugin-rsc@0.5.4","plugin-rsc@0.5.5","plugin-rsc@0.5.6","plugin-rsc@0.5.7","v3.9.0-beta.2","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v4.3.4","v4.4.0-beta.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68155.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68155.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/29708"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/30741"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/commit/582fba0b9a52b13fcff6beaaa3bfbd532bc5359d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/security/advisories/GHSA-g239-q96q-x4qm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68155"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-73"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68155.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
