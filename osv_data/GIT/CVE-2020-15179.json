Using <script> tag inside <scratchsig> tag, attackers with edit permission can execute scripts on visitors' browser. With MediaWiki JavaScript API, this can potentially lead to privilege escalation and/or account takeover. This has been patched in release 1.0.1. This has already been deployed to all Scratch Wikis. No workarounds exist other than disabling the extension completely.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/internationalscratchwiki/wiki-scratchsig","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4160a39a20eebeb63a59eb7597a91b961eca6388"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-15179.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/InternationalScratchWiki/wiki-scratchsig/commit/4160a39a20eebeb63a59eb7597a91b961eca6388"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/InternationalScratchWiki/wiki-scratchsig/security/advisories/GHSA-gp9v-pg9f-vmp6"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
