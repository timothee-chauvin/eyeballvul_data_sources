This happened when a server responded to a ClientHello containing psk_dhe_ke without a key_share extension. The re-use of an authenticated PSK connection that on the clients side unexpectedly did not have PFS, reduces the security of the connection.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl","events":[{"introduced":"decea12e223869c8f8f3ab5a53dc90b69f436eb2"},{"fixed":"59f4fa568615396fbf381b073b220d1e8d61e4c2"}]}],"versions":["v5.8.2-stable"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-11935.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/9112"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
