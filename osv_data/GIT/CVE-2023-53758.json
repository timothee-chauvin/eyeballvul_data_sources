So this results in an spi controller with an unbound parent\nand unmapped register space (because devm_ioremap_resource() is undone).\nSo using the remaining spi controller probably results in an oops.\n\nInstead unregister the controller unconditionally and only skip hardware\naccess and clk disable.\n\nAlso add a warning about resume failing and return zero unconditionally.\nThe latter has the only effect to suppress a less helpful error message by\nthe spi core.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"4a2f83b7f78092a6d9e98fb5573d8f4b79c56336"},{"fixed":"f6974fb20499e3b6522daa7aec822aac11dfcf42"},{"fixed":"618770d4d8e40b7f8ed9eb5f210cd9164dfac47d"},{"fixed":"77806d7c9bebe40a8cdce2b8d30fbe6511745df8"},{"fixed":"9448bc1dee65f86c0fe64d9dea8b410af0586886"}]}],"versions":["v5.19","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.2.1","v6.2.10","v6.2.11","v6.2.12","v6.2.13","v6.2.14","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4","v6.2.5","v6.2.6","v6.2.7","v6.2.8","v6.2.9","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.3.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53758.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.28"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.15"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.3.0"},{"fixed":"6.3.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53758.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/618770d4d8e40b7f8ed9eb5f210cd9164dfac47d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/77806d7c9bebe40a8cdce2b8d30fbe6511745df8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9448bc1dee65f86c0fe64d9dea8b410af0586886"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f6974fb20499e3b6522daa7aec822aac11dfcf42"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53758.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53758"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53758.json"}}
