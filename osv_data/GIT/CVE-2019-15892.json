An HTTP/1 parsing failure allows a remote attacker to trigger an assert by sending crafted HTTP/1 requests. The assert will cause an automatic restart with a clean cache, which makes it a Denial of Service attack.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache","events":[{"introduced":"a068361dff0d25a0d85cf82a6e5fdaf315e06a7d"},{"fixed":"14d4eee6f0afc3020a044341235f54f3bd1449f1"}]}],"versions":["varnish-6.0.0","varnish-6.0.1","varnish-6.0.2","varnish-6.0.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-15892.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Sep/5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00003.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4514"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00069.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00089.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3OEOCYRU43TWEU2C65F3D6GK64MSWNNK/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DBAQF6UDRSTURGINIMSMLJR4PTDYWA7C/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KLSF54TDJWJLINIFEW5V5BKDNY5EQRR3/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
