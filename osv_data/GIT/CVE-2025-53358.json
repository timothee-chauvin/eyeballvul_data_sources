From versions 0.10.6 and prior, in libs/ktem/ktem/index/file/ui.py, the index_fn method accepts both URLs and local file paths without validation. The pipeline streams these paths directly and stores them, enabling attackers to traverse directories (e.g. ../../../../../.env) and exfiltrate sensitive files. This issue has been patched via commit 37cdc28, in version 0.10.7 which has not been made public at time of publication.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cinnamon/kotaemon","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"37cdc28ceb46e505d25221584daf1fe61e26b2cc"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.0","v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.10.3","v0.10.4","v0.10.5","v0.10.6","v0.10.7","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.10","v0.4.11","v0.4.12","v0.4.13","v0.4.14","v0.4.15","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.4.8","v0.4.9","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.10","v0.6.11","v0.6.12","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v0.6.6","v0.6.7","v0.6.8","v0.6.9","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.5","v0.7.6","v0.7.7","v0.7.8","v0.7.9","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.10","v0.9.11","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.5","v0.9.6","v0.9.7","v0.9.8","v0.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53358.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/53xxx/CVE-2025-53358.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/commit/37cdc28ceb46e505d25221584daf1fe61e26b2cc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/pull/755"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/security/advisories/GHSA-jw4w-xcvf-jq5x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53358"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/53xxx/CVE-2025-53358.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
