If the $patternselect parameter to validateAddress() is set to 'php' (the default, defined by PHPMailer::$validator), and the global namespace contains a function called php, it will be called in preference to the built-in validator of the same name. Mitigated in PHPMailer 6.5.0 by denying the use of simple strings as validator function names.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/phpmailer/phpmailer","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"45f3c18dc6a2de1cb1bf49b9b249a9ee36a5f7f3"}]}],"versions":["v2.2.1","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.2.10","v5.2.11","v5.2.12","v5.2.13","v5.2.14","v5.2.15","v5.2.16","v5.2.17","v5.2.18","v5.2.19","v5.2.2","v5.2.20","v5.2.21","v5.2.22","v5.2.23","v5.2.24","v5.2.25","v5.2.4","v5.2.5","v5.2.6","v5.2.7","v5.2.8","v5.2.9","v6.0.0","v6.0.0rc1","v6.0.0rc2","v6.0.0rc3","v6.0.0rc4","v6.0.0rc5","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.0.6","v6.0.7","v6.1.0","v6.1.1","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.2.0","v6.3.0","v6.4.0","v6.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-3603.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/commit/45f3c18dc6a2de1cb1bf49b9b249a9ee36a5f7f3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3YRMWGA4VTMXFB22KICMB7YMFZNFV3EJ/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FJYSOFCUBS67J3TKR74SD3C454N7VTYM/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/1-PHPMailer/PHPMailer/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
