This can happen when (a) the client has\nconnection to the server but no session or (b) another thread ends up\nsetting @ses->ses_status again to something different than\nSES_EXITING.\n\nTo fix this, we need to make sure to unconditionally set\n@ses->ses_status to SES_EXITING and prevent any other threads from\nsetting a new status while we're still tearing it down.\n\nThe following can be reproduced by adding some delay to right after\nthe ipc is freed in __cifs_put_smb_ses() - which will give\nsmb2_reconnect_server() worker a chance to run and then accessing\n@ses->ipc:\n\nkinit
