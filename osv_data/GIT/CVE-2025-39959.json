This change ensures that all\nrelevant functions correctly retrieve acp_chip_info, preventing\nfurther null pointer dereference issues.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"e3933683b25e2cc94485da4909e3338e1a177b39"},{"fixed":"65c5cfbd6d938f77a0df3c34855a4f7d8a61fd10"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"e3933683b25e2cc94485da4909e3338e1a177b39"},{"fixed":"d7871f400cad1da376f1d7724209a1c49226c456"}]}],"versions":["v6.14","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.16.1","v6.16.2","v6.16.3","v6.16.4","v6.16.5","v6.16.6","v6.16.7","v6.16.8","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39959.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.15.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39959.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/65c5cfbd6d938f77a0df3c34855a4f7d8a61fd10"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d7871f400cad1da376f1d7724209a1c49226c456"}]}
