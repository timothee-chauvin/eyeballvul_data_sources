When using an ACL on a device connected to a bridge, Incus versions 6.12 and 6.13generates nftables rules that partially bypass security options `security.mac_filtering`, `security.ipv4_filtering` and `security.ipv6_filtering`. This can lead to ARP spoofing on the bridge and to fully spoof another VM/container on the same bridge. Commit 254dfd2483ab8de39b47c2258b7f1cf0759231c8 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lxc/incus","events":[{"introduced":"11f8f9e6ae151984a7abd2d9f9b02a6f3c9af320"},{"fixed":"254dfd2483ab8de39b47c2258b7f1cf0759231c8"}]}],"versions":["v6.12.0","v6.13.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52890.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/52xxx/CVE-2025-52890.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lxc/incus/commit/254dfd2483ab8de39b47c2258b7f1cf0759231c8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/lxc/incus/security/advisories/GHSA-p7fw-vjjm-2rwp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-52890"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-863"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/52xxx/CVE-2025-52890.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
