This check works well\nfor most cases, but it does not work for conventional zones on zoned\nblock devices. F2fs assumes that zoned block devices support discard,\nand calls __submit_discard_cmd(). When __submit_discard_cmd() is called\nfor sequential write required zones, it works fine since\n__submit_discard_cmd() issues zone reset commands instead of discard\ncommands. However, when __submit_discard_cmd() is called for\nconventional zones, __blkdev_issue_discard() is called even when the\ndevices do not support discard.\n\nThe inappropriate __blkdev_issue_discard() call was not a problem before\nthe commit 30f1e7241422 (\"block: move discard checks into the ioctl\nhandler\") because __blkdev_issue_discard() checked if the target devices\nsupport discard or not. If not, it returned EOPNOTSUPP. After the\ncommit, __blkdev_issue_discard() no longer checks it. It always returns\nzero and sets NULL to the given bio pointer. This NULL pointer triggers\nf2fs_bug_on() in __submit_discard_cmd(). The BUG is recreated with the\ncommands below at the umount step, where /dev/nullb0 is a zoned null_blk\nwith 5GB total size, 128MB zone size and 10 conventional zones.\n\n$ mkfs.f2fs -f -m /dev/nullb0\n$ mount /dev/nullb0 /mnt\n$ for ((i=0;i<5;i++)); do dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test bs=65536 count=1600 conv=fsync; done\n$ umount /mnt\n\nTo fix the BUG, avoid the inappropriate __blkdev_issue_discard() call.\nWhen discard is requested for conventional zones, check if the device\nsupports discard or not. If not, return EOPNOTSUPP.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"30f1e724142242a453f92d90b33e030014900bf0"},{"fixed":"7bd7ce68ddad5a28565e42ef21cacaff113773a9"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"30f1e724142242a453f92d90b33e030014900bf0"},{"fixed":"d2352b57897f6a3349666fc318dcbec99092c6a5"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"30f1e724142242a453f92d90b33e030014900bf0"},{"fixed":"43aec4d01bd2ce961817a777b3846f8318f398e4"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.10.1","v6.10.10","v6.10.11","v6.10.12","v6.10.2","v6.10.3","v6.10.4","v6.10.5","v6.10.6","v6.10.7","v6.10.8","v6.10.9","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.11.1","v6.9","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47680.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.10.0"},{"fixed":"6.10.13"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.11.0"},{"fixed":"6.11.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47680.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/43aec4d01bd2ce961817a777b3846f8318f398e4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7bd7ce68ddad5a28565e42ef21cacaff113773a9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d2352b57897f6a3349666fc318dcbec99092c6a5"}]}
