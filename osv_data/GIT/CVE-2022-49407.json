A unlock will allocate a\n\"struct plock_op\" and a followed send_op() will append it to a global\nsend_list data structure. In some cases a followed dev_read() moves it\nto recv_list and dev_write() will cast it to \"struct plock_xop\" and access\nfields which are only available in those structures. At this point an\ninvalid read happens by accessing those fields.\n\nTo fix this issue the \"callback\" field is moved to \"struct plock_op\" to\nindicate that a cast to \"plock_xop\" is allowed and does the additional\n\"plock_xop\" handling if set.\n\nExample of the KASAN output which showed the invalid read:\n\n[ 2064.296453]
