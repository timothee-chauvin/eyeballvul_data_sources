{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-30360","published":"2025-06-03T17:41:59Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:36:24.363771Z","aliases":["GHSA-9jgg-88mc-972h"],"summary":"webpack-dev-server users' source code may be stolen when they access a malicious web site with non-Chromium based browser","details":"webpack-dev-server allows users to use webpack with a development server that provides live reloading. Prior to version 5.2.1, webpack-dev-server users' source code may be stolen when you access a malicious web site with non-Chromium based browser. The `Origin` header is checked to prevent Cross-site WebSocket hijacking from happening, which was reported by CVE-2018-14732. But webpack-dev-server always allows IP address `Origin` headers. This allows websites that are served on IP addresses to connect WebSocket. An attacker can obtain source code via a method similar to that used to exploit CVE-2018-14732. Version 5.2.1 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0d22a08cc96deeb4421251ff41a915dcda1b59c5"}]}],"versions":["v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.9.0","v2.0.0-beta","v2.1.0-beta.0","v2.1.0-beta.1","v2.1.0-beta.10","v2.1.0-beta.11","v2.1.0-beta.12","v2.1.0-beta.2","v2.1.0-beta.3","v2.1.0-beta.4","v2.1.0-beta.5","v2.1.0-beta.6","v2.1.0-beta.7","v2.1.0-beta.8","v2.1.0-beta.9","v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.11.0","v2.11.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.0-rc.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.5","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v2.9.2","v2.9.3","v2.9.5","v2.9.6","v2.9.7","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-beta.1","v3.0.0-beta.2","v3.0.1-beta.0","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.10","v3.1.11","v3.1.12","v3.1.13","v3.1.14","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.1.4","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.1.9","v3.10.0","v3.10.2","v3.10.3","v3.11.0","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.7.2","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.8.2","v3.9.0","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-beta.0","v4.0.0-beta.1","v4.0.0-beta.2","v4.0.0-beta.3","v4.0.0-rc.0","v4.0.0-rc.1","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.10.0","v4.10.1","v4.11.0","v4.11.1","v4.12.0","v4.13.0","v4.13.1","v4.13.2","v4.13.3","v4.14.0","v4.15.0","v4.15.1","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.4.0","v4.5.0","v4.6.0","v4.7.0","v4.7.1","v4.7.2","v4.7.3","v4.7.4","v4.8.0","v4.8.1","v4.9.0","v4.9.1","v4.9.2","v4.9.3","v5.0.0","v5.0.1","v5.0.2","v5.0.3","v5.0.4","v5.1.0","v5.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-30360.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/55220a800ba4e30dbde2d98785ecf4c80b32f711/lib/Server.js#L3113-L3127"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/5c9378bb01276357d7af208a0856ca2163db188e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/72efaab83381a0e1c4914adf401cbd210b7de7eb"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/security/advisories/GHSA-9jgg-88mc-972h"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-346"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
