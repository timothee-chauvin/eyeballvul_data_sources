The issue could occur when `dc->clk_mgr` or\n`dc->clk_mgr->funcs` is null.\n\nThe fix adds a check to ensure `dc->clk_mgr` and `dc->clk_mgr->funcs` is\nnot null before accessing its functions. This prevents a potential null\npointer dereference.\n\nReported by smatch:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:789 dcn30_init_hw() error: we previously assumed
