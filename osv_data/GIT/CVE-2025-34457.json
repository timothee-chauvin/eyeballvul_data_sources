{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-34457","published":"2025-12-22T22:16:04.493Z","modified":"2025-12-25T03:46:44.806618Z","details":"wb2osz/direwolf (Dire Wolf) versions up to and including 1.8, prior to commit 694c954, contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the function kiss_rec_byte() located in src/kiss_frame.c. When processing crafted KISS frames that reach the maximum allowed frame length (MAX_KISS_LEN), the function appends a terminating FEND byte without reserving sufficient space in the stack buffer. This results in an out-of-bounds write followed by an out-of-bounds read during the subsequent call to kiss_unwrap(), leading to stack memory corruption or application crashes. This vulnerability may allow remote unauthenticated attackers to trigger a denial-of-service condition.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"694c954"}]}],"versions":["1.0","1.1","1.2","1.3","1.3-beta","1.3-dev-F","1.3-dev-I","1.3-dev-K","1.4","1.4-beta","1.4-dev-D","1.4-dev-E","1.5","1.5-beta","1.5-beta2","1.5-beta3","1.5-beta4","1.6","1.7","1.7-dev-A","1.8-beta1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-34457.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/marlinkcyber/advisories/blob/main/advisories/MCSAID-2025-010-direwolf-stack-buffer-overflow-kiss-frame.md"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/wb2osz-direwolf-stack-based-buffer-overflow-dos"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/issues/617"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/commit/694c954"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
