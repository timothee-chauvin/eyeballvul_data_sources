Instead,\ncall cancel_work_sync for e1000_reset_task when the device is being\nremoved.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"e400c7444d84b0fd2ebb34e618f83abe05917543"},{"fixed":"1fd4438ddcc4958ed24662d5125114299e19bae4"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"e400c7444d84b0fd2ebb34e618f83abe05917543"},{"fixed":"b4a8085ceefb7bbb12c2b71c55e71fc946c6929f"}]}],"versions":["v6.12","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.15.1","v6.15.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38114.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.15.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38114.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1fd4438ddcc4958ed24662d5125114299e19bae4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b4a8085ceefb7bbb12c2b71c55e71fc946c6929f"}]}
