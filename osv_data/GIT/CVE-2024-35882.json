{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-35882","published":"2024-05-19T08:34:39Z","modified":"2025-10-21T21:29:00.867738Z","summary":"SUNRPC: Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nSUNRPC: Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP\n\nJan Schunk reports that his small NFS servers suffer from memory\nexhaustion after just a few days. A bisect shows that commit\ne18e157bb5c8 (\"SUNRPC: Send RPC message on TCP with a single\nsock_sendmsg() call\") is the first bad commit.\n\nThat commit assumed that sock_sendmsg() releases all the pages in\nthe underlying bio_vec array, but the reality is that it doesn't.\nsvc_xprt_release() releases the rqst's response pages, but the\nrecord marker page fragment isn't one of those, so it is never\nreleased.\n\nThis is a narrow fix that can be applied to stable kernels. A\nmore extensive fix is in the works.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"e18e157bb5c8c1cd8a9ba25acfdcf4f3035836f4"},{"fixed":"1ba1291172f935e6b6fe703161a948f3347400b8"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"e18e157bb5c8c1cd8a9ba25acfdcf4f3035836f4"},{"fixed":"a2ebedf7bcd17a1194a0a18122c885eb578ee882"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"e18e157bb5c8c1cd8a9ba25acfdcf4f3035836f4"},{"fixed":"05258a0a69b3c5d2c003f818702c0a52b6fea861"}]}],"versions":["v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.3","v6.6.4","v6.6.5","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.8.1","v6.8.2","v6.8.3","v6.8.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-35882.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.6.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.26"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.8.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-35882.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/05258a0a69b3c5d2c003f818702c0a52b6fea861"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1ba1291172f935e6b6fe703161a948f3347400b8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a2ebedf7bcd17a1194a0a18122c885eb578ee882"}]}
