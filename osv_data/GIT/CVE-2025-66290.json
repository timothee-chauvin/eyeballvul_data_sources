{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-66290","published":"2025-11-29T03:06:56.280Z","modified":"2025-12-01T19:57:04.965698Z","aliases":["GHSA-qf8r-c54j-jw88"],"summary":"OrangeHRM is Vulnerable to Improper Authorization Allowing Unauthorized Access to Candidate Attachments","details":"OrangeHRM is a comprehensive human resource management (HRM) system. From version 5.0 to 5.7, the application’s recruitment attachment retrieval endpoint does not enforce the required authorization checks before serving candidate files. Even users restricted to ESS-level access, who have no permission to view the Recruitment module, can directly access candidate attachment URLs. When an authenticated request is made to the attachment endpoint, the system validates the session but does not confirm that the requesting user has the necessary recruitment permissions. As a result, any authenticated user can download CVs and other uploaded documents for arbitrary candidates by issuing direct requests to the attachment endpoint, leading to unauthorized exposure of sensitive applicant data. This issue has been patched in version 5.8.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/orangehrm/orangehrm","events":[{"introduced":"7bd109532b98fbf2896627b86099cc82afe215fb"},{"fixed":"d3815c0d746f1484d76e3d59d25ae55f48edd9fa"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"5.0"},{"fixed":"5.8"}]}}],"versions":["v.5.0","v5.1","v5.2","v5.3","v5.4","v5.5","v5.6","v5.6.1","v5.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66290.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/orangehrm/orangehrm/security/advisories/GHSA-qf8r-c54j-jw88"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200","CWE-285"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
