  "id": "CVE-2023-31287",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in Serenity Serene (and StartSharp) before 6.7.0. Password reset links are sent by email. A link contains a token that is used to reset the password. This token remains valid even after the password reset and can be used a second time to change the password of the corresponding user. The token expires only 3 hours after issuance and is sent as a query parameter when resetting. An attacker with access to the browser history can thus use the token again to change the password in order to take over the account.",
