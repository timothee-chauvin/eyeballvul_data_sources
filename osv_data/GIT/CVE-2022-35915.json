The target contract of an EIP-165 `supportsInterface` query can cause unbounded gas consumption by returning a lot of data, while it is generally assumed that this operation has a bounded cost. The issue has been fixed in v4.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts","events":[{"introduced":"06e265b38d3e9daeaa7b33f9035c700d6bc0c6a0"},{"fixed":"64e48203cecad94f02de9891ecdeed4d629c6dae"}]}],"versions":["v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0-rc.1","v2.1.0-rc.2","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.2.0","v2.2.0-rc.1","v2.3.0","v2.3.0-rc.0","v2.3.0-rc.1","v2.3.0-rc.2","v2.3.0-rc.3","v2.4.0","v2.4.0-beta.0","v2.4.0-beta.1","v2.4.0-beta.2","v2.5.0","v2.5.0-rc.0","v2.5.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-rc.0","v3.0.0-rc.1","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.1.0","v3.1.0-rc.0","v3.1.0-solc-0.7","v3.2.0","v3.2.0-rc.0","v3.2.1-solc-0.7","v3.2.2-solc-0.7","v3.3.0","v3.3.0-rc.0","v3.3.0-rc.1","v3.3.0-rc.2","v3.4.0","v3.4.0-rc.0","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-beta.0","v4.0.0-beta.1","v4.0.0-rc.0","v4.1.0","v4.1.0-rc.0","v4.2.0","v4.2.0-rc.0","v4.3.0","v4.3.0-rc.0","v4.3.1","v4.3.2","v4.4.0","v4.4.0-rc.0","v4.4.0-rc.1","v4.4.1","v4.7.0","v4.7.0-rc.0","v4.7.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35915.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable","events":[{"introduced":"e5ba8666de51d445ad26329d74c3c295abd34595"},{"fixed":"12ad9ea7c8e8e78f6eba9ad71ad156645d3c5b4c"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35915.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/35xxx/CVE-2022-35915.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3587"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-7grf-83vw-6f5x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35915"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-400"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/35xxx/CVE-2022-35915.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
