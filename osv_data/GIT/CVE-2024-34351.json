A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in Next.js Server Actions. If the `Host` header is modified, and the below conditions are also met, an attacker may be able to make requests that appear to be originating from the Next.js application server itself. The required conditions are 1) Next.js is running in a self-hosted manner; 2) the Next.js application makes use of Server Actions; and 3) the Server Action performs a redirect to a relative path which starts with a `/`. This vulnerability was fixed in Next.js `14.1.1`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js","events":[{"introduced":"fb12a6dc877c5ce2f21246f4921494a1b8e356a6"},{"fixed":"5f59ee5f197a09275da7a9fa876986f22f4b7711"}]}],"versions":["v13.4.0","v13.4.1","v13.4.1-canary.0","v13.4.1-canary.1","v13.4.1-canary.2","v13.4.10","v13.4.10-canary.0","v13.4.10-canary.1","v13.4.10-canary.2","v13.4.10-canary.3","v13.4.10-canary.4","v13.4.10-canary.5","v13.4.10-canary.6","v13.4.10-canary.7","v13.4.10-canary.8","v13.4.11","v13.4.11-canary.0","v13.4.11-canary.1","v13.4.11-canary.2","v13.4.12","v13.4.13","v13.4.13-canary.0","v13.4.13-canary.1","v13.4.13-canary.10","v13.4.13-canary.11","v13.4.13-canary.12","v13.4.13-canary.13","v13.4.13-canary.14","v13.4.13-canary.15","v13.4.13-canary.16","v13.4.13-canary.17","v13.4.13-canary.18","v13.4.13-canary.2","v13.4.13-canary.3","v13.4.13-canary.4","v13.4.13-canary.5","v13.4.13-canary.6","v13.4.13-canary.7","v13.4.13-canary.8","v13.4.13-canary.9","v13.4.14","v13.4.14-canary.0","v13.4.14-canary.1","v13.4.14-canary.2","v13.4.14-canary.3","v13.4.14-canary.4","v13.4.14-canary.5","v13.4.15","v13.4.15-canary.0","v13.4.16","v13.4.16-canary.0","v13.4.16-canary.1","v13.4.17","v13.4.17-canary.0","v13.4.17-canary.1","v13.4.17-canary.2","v13.4.18","v13.4.18-canary.0","v13.4.19","v13.4.19-canary.0","v13.4.2","v13.4.2-canary.0","v13.4.2-canary.1","v13.4.2-canary.2","v13.4.2-canary.3","v13.4.2-canary.4","v13.4.2-canary.5","v13.4.2-canary.6","v13.4.20-canary.0","v13.4.20-canary.1","v13.4.20-canary.10","v13.4.20-canary.11","v13.4.20-canary.12","v13.4.20-canary.13","v13.4.20-canary.14","v13.4.20-canary.15","v13.4.20-canary.16","v13.4.20-canary.17","v13.4.20-canary.18","v13.4.20-canary.19","v13.4.20-canary.2","v13.4.20-canary.20","v13.4.20-canary.21","v13.4.20-canary.22","v13.4.20-canary.23","v13.4.20-canary.24","v13.4.20-canary.25","v13.4.20-canary.26","v13.4.20-canary.27","v13.4.20-canary.28","v13.4.20-canary.29","v13.4.20-canary.3","v13.4.20-canary.31","v13.4.20-canary.32","v13.4.20-canary.33","v13.4.20-canary.34","v13.4.20-canary.35","v13.4.20-canary.36","v13.4.20-canary.37","v13.4.20-canary.38","v13.4.20-canary.39","v13.4.20-canary.4","v13.4.20-canary.40","v13.4.20-canary.41","v13.4.20-canary.5","v13.4.20-canary.6","v13.4.20-canary.7","v13.4.20-canary.8","v13.4.20-canary.9","v13.4.3","v13.4.3-canary.0","v13.4.3-canary.1","v13.4.3-canary.2","v13.4.3-canary.3","v13.4.4","v13.4.4-canary.0","v13.4.4-canary.1","v13.4.4-canary.10","v13.4.4-canary.11","v13.4.4-canary.12","v13.4.4-canary.13","v13.4.4-canary.2","v13.4.4-canary.3","v13.4.4-canary.4","v13.4.4-canary.5","v13.4.4-canary.6","v13.4.4-canary.7","v13.4.4-canary.8","v13.4.4-canary.9","v13.4.5","v13.4.5-canary.0","v13.4.5-canary.1","v13.4.5-canary.10","v13.4.5-canary.11","v13.4.5-canary.12","v13.4.5-canary.2","v13.4.5-canary.3","v13.4.5-canary.4","v13.4.5-canary.5","v13.4.5-canary.6","v13.4.5-canary.7","v13.4.5-canary.8","v13.4.5-canary.9","v13.4.6","v13.4.6-canary.0","v13.4.6-canary.1","v13.4.6-canary.2","v13.4.6-canary.3","v13.4.6-canary.4","v13.4.6-canary.5","v13.4.6-canary.6","v13.4.6-canary.7","v13.4.6-canary.8","v13.4.7","v13.4.7-canary.0","v13.4.7-canary.1","v13.4.7-canary.2","v13.4.7-canary.3","v13.4.7-canary.4","v13.4.8","v13.4.8-canary.0","v13.4.8-canary.1","v13.4.8-canary.10","v13.4.8-canary.11","v13.4.8-canary.12","v13.4.8-canary.13","v13.4.8-canary.14","v13.4.8-canary.15","v13.4.8-canary.2","v13.4.8-canary.3","v13.4.8-canary.4","v13.4.8-canary.5","v13.4.8-canary.6","v13.4.8-canary.7","v13.4.8-canary.8","v13.4.8-canary.9","v13.4.9","v13.4.9-canary.0","v13.4.9-canary.1","v13.4.9-canary.2","v13.4.9-canary.3","v13.5.0","v13.5.1","v13.5.1-canary.0","v13.5.1-canary.1","v13.5.2","v13.5.2-canary.0","v13.5.2-canary.1","v13.5.2-canary.2","v13.5.3","v13.5.3-canary.0","v13.5.3-canary.1","v13.5.3-canary.3","v13.5.3-canary.4","v13.5.4","v13.5.4-canary.0","v13.5.4-canary.1","v13.5.4-canary.11","v13.5.4-canary.2","v13.5.4-canary.3","v13.5.4-canary.4","v13.5.4-canary.5","v13.5.4-canary.6","v13.5.4-canary.7","v13.5.4-canary.8","v13.5.4-canary.9","v13.5.5","v13.5.5-canary.0","v13.5.5-canary.1","v13.5.5-canary.10","v13.5.5-canary.11","v13.5.5-canary.12","v13.5.5-canary.13","v13.5.5-canary.14","v13.5.5-canary.15","v13.5.5-canary.16","v13.5.5-canary.17","v13.5.5-canary.18","v13.5.5-canary.19","v13.5.5-canary.2","v13.5.5-canary.3","v13.5.5-canary.4","v13.5.5-canary.5","v13.5.5-canary.6","v13.5.5-canary.7","v13.5.5-canary.8","v13.5.5-canary.9","v13.5.6-canary.0","v13.5.6-canary.1","v13.5.6-canary.2","v13.5.6-canary.3","v13.5.6-canary.4","v13.5.6-canary.5","v13.5.6-canary.6","v13.5.6-canary.7","v13.5.6-canary.8","v13.5.7-canary.10","v13.5.7-canary.11","v13.5.7-canary.12","v13.5.7-canary.13","v13.5.7-canary.14","v13.5.7-canary.15","v13.5.7-canary.16","v13.5.7-canary.17","v13.5.7-canary.18","v13.5.7-canary.19","v13.5.7-canary.20","v13.5.7-canary.21","v13.5.7-canary.22","v13.5.7-canary.23","v13.5.7-canary.24","v13.5.7-canary.25","v13.5.7-canary.26","v13.5.7-canary.27","v1
