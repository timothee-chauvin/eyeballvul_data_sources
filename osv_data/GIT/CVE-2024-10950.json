The root cause is the execution of user-provided prompts that generate untrusted code without a sandbox, allowing the execution of parts of the LLM-generated code. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the application backend server, potentially gaining full control of the server.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/binary-husky/gpt_academic","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"573dc4d1844705b738d3c830774c4d10dca96fad"}]}],"versions":["version2.68-3","version2.68-4","version2.7","version3.1","version3.1-2","version3.1-3","version3.15","version3.2","version3.3","version3.3-2","version3.3-3","version3.3-4","version3.32","version3.33","version3.33-2","version3.34","version3.35","version3.36","version3.37","version3.37-2","version3.37-3","version3.37-4","version3.4","version3.4-2","version3.41","version3.41-2","version3.41-3","version3.42","version3.42-2","version3.43","version3.44","version3.45","version3.47","version3.48","version3.48-1","version3.50","version3.50-1","version3.50-2","version3.50-3","version3.52","version3.52-1","version3.53","version3.53-1","version3.53-2","version3.54","version3.54-2","version3.55","version3.55-2","version3.60-1","version3.60-2","version3.60-3","version3.64-1","version3.70","version3.74","version3.75","version3.83"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-10950.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/9abb1617-0c1d-42c7-a647-d9d2b39c6866"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
