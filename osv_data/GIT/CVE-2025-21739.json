For UFS, the\ncrypto private data and pointers are stored as part of the ufs_hba's\ndata structure 'struct ufs_hba::crypto_profile'. This structure is\nallocated as part of the underlying ufshcd and therefore Scsi_host\nallocation.\n\nDuring driver release or during error handling in ufshcd_pltfrm_init(),\nthis structure is released as part of ufshcd_dealloc_host() before the\n(platform-) device associated with the crypto call above is released.\nOnce this device is released, the crypto cleanup code will run, using\nthe just-released 'struct ufs_hba::crypto_profile'. This causes a\nuse-after-free situation:\n\n  Call trace:\n   kfree+0x60/0x2d8 (P)\n   kvfree+0x44/0x60\n   blk_crypto_profile_destroy_callback+0x28/0x70\n   devm_action_release+0x1c/0x30\n   release_nodes+0x6c/0x108\n   devres_release_all+0x98/0x100\n   device_unbind_cleanup+0x20/0x70\n   really_probe+0x218/0x2d0\n\nIn other words, the initialisation code flow is:\n\n  platform-device probe\n    ufshcd_pltfrm_init()\n      ufshcd_alloc_host()\n        scsi_host_alloc()\n          allocation of struct ufs_hba\n          creation of scsi-host devices\n    devm_blk_crypto_profile_init()\n      devm registration of cleanup handler using platform-device\n\nand during error handling of ufshcd_pltfrm_init() or during driver\nremoval:\n\n  ufshcd_dealloc_host()\n    scsi_host_put()\n      put_device(scsi-host)\n        release of struct ufs_hba\n  put_device(platform-device)\n    crypto cleanup handler\n\nTo fix this use-after free, change ufshcd_alloc_host() to register a\ndevres action to automatically cleanup the underlying SCSI device on\nufshcd destruction, without requiring explicit calls to\nufshcd_dealloc_host(). This way:\n\n    * the crypto profile and all other ufs_hba-owned resources are\n      destroyed before SCSI (as they've been registered after)\n    * a memleak is plugged in tc-dwc-g210-pci.c remove() as a\n      side-effect\n    * EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ufshcd_dealloc_host) can be removed fully as\n      it's not needed anymore\n    * no future drivers using ufshcd_alloc_host() could ever forget\n      adding the cleanup","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d76d9d7d1009968dd3a0fc30e5f5ee9fbffc1350"},{"fixed":"0c77c0d754fe83cb154715fcfec6c3faef94f207"},{"fixed":"9c185beae09a3eb85f54777edafa227f7e03075d"},{"fixed":"f8fb2403ddebb5eea0033d90d9daae4c88749ada"}]}],"versions":["v5.11","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.13.1","v6.13.2","v6.14-rc1","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21739.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.14"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.13.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21739.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0c77c0d754fe83cb154715fcfec6c3faef94f207"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9c185beae09a3eb85f54777edafa227f7e03075d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f8fb2403ddebb5eea0033d90d9daae4c88749ada"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/21xxx/CVE-2025-21739.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21739"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/21xxx/CVE-2025-21739.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
