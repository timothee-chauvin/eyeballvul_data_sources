A specially crafted Socket.IO packet can trigger an uncaught exception on the Socket.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This issue is fixed by commit `15af22fc22` which has been included in `socket.io@4.6.2` (released in May 2023). The fix was backported in the 2.x branch as well with commit `d30630ba10`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may attach a listener for the \"error\" event to catch these errors.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/socketio/socket.io","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"88b2cdb6abd38d6466fa4360748f2f67d8837ad4"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.5.1"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/socketio/socket.io","events":[{"introduced":"1af3267e3f5f7884214cf2ca4d5282d620092fb0"},{"fixed":"faf914c9ab3e06a6e84fc91774a4182e58f8ae70"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.0.0"},{"fixed":"4.6.2"}]}}],"versions":["0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.10","0.7.11","0.7.2","0.7.3","0.7.4","0.7.5","0.7.6","0.7.7","0.7.8","0.7.9","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.8.2","0.8.3","0.8.4","0.8.5","0.8.6","0.8.7","0.9.0","0.9.1","0.9.1-1","0.9.10","0.9.11","0.9.12","0.9.2","0.9.3","0.9.4","0.9.5","0.9.7","0.9.8","0.9.9","1.0.0","1.0.0-pre","1.0.0-pre2","1.0.0-pre3","1.0.0-pre4","1.0.0-pre5","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.5","1.3.6","1.3.7","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.4.8","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.6.0","1.7.0","1.7.1","1.7.2","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.5.0","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.1.2","4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.1.0","4.1.1","4.1.2","4.1.3","4.2.0","4.3.0","4.3.1","4.3.2","4.4.0","4.4.1","4.5.0","4.5.1","4.5.2","4.5.3","4.5.4","4.6.0","4.6.0-alpha1","4.6.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-38355.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/15af22fc22bc6030fcead322c106f07640336115"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/d30630ba10562bf987f4d2b42440fc41a828119c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/security/advisories/GHSA-25hc-qcg6-38wj"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/unhandled-exception-in-socketio-cve-2024-38355"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20","CWE-754"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
