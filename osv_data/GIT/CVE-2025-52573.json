{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-52573","published":"2025-06-26T14:08:56.100Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:37:51.361716Z","aliases":["GHSA-6f6r-m9pv-67jw"],"summary":"Command Injection in MCP Server ios-simulator-mcp","details":"iOS Simulator MCP Server (ios-simulator-mcp) is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with iOS simulators. Versions prior to 1.3.3 are written in a way that is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability attacks as part of some of its MCP Server tool definition and implementation. The MCP Server exposes the tool `ui_tap` which relies on Node.js child process API `exec` which is an unsafe and vulnerable API if concatenated with untrusted user input. LLM exposed user input for `duration`, `udid`, and `x` and `y` args can be replaced with shell meta-characters like `;` or `&&` or others to change the behavior from running the expected command `idb` to another command. When LLMs are tricked through prompt injection (and other techniques and attack vectors) to call the tool with input that uses special shell characters such as `; rm -rf /tmp;#` and other payload variations, the full command-line text will be interepted by the shell and result in other commands except of `ps` executing on the host running the MCP Server. Version 1.3.3 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"eb53a4f2cc8bbeb13e8d6d930f00167befcdb809"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52573.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp/blob/main/src/index.ts#L166-L207"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp/commit/eb53a4f2cc8bbeb13e8d6d930f00167befcdb809"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp/releases/tag/v1.3.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp/security/advisories/GHSA-6f6r-m9pv-67jw"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-78"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
