Prior to version 25.11.0, a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the LibreNMS application at the /maps/nodeimage endpoint. The Image Name parameter is reflected in the HTTP response without proper output encoding or sanitization, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that, when visited by a victim, causes arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim’s browser. This issue has been patched in version 25.11.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"aa2146888bee34ae7b250f14992a2f195ffa0c53"}]}],"versions":["0.1","1.19","1.20","1.21","1.25","1.26","1.27","1.28","1.29","1.30","1.30.01","1.31","1.31.01","1.31.02","1.31.03","1.32","1.33","1.35","1.36","1.37","1.38","1.39","1.40","1.41","1.42","1.42.01","1.43","1.44","1.45","1.46","1.47","1.48","1.48.1","1.49","1.50","1.51","1.52","1.53","1.53.1","1.54","1.55","1.56","1.57","1.58","1.58.1","1.59","1.60","1.61","1.62","1.63","1.64","1.64.1","1.65","1.66","1.67","1.68","1.69","1.70.0","1.70.1","201505","201506","201507","201508","201509","201510","201511","201512","201601","201602","201603","201604","201605","201606","201607","201608","20160828","201609","21.1.0","21.10.0","21.11.0","21.12.0","21.12.1","21.2.0","21.3.0","21.4.0","21.5.0","21.5.1","21.6.0","21.7.0","21.8.0","21.9.0","22.1.0","22.10.0","22.11.0","22.12.0","22.2.0","22.2.1","22.3.0","22.4.0","22.5.0","22.6.0","22.7.0","22.8.0","22.9.0","23.1.0","23.10.0","23.11.0","23.2.0","23.4.0","23.4.1","23.5.0","23.6.0","23.7.0","23.8.0","23.8.1","23.8.2","23.9.0","23.9.1","24.1.0","24.10.0","24.10.1","24.11.0","24.12.0","24.2.0","24.3.0","24.4.0","24.4.1","24.5.0","24.6.0","24.7.0","24.8.0","24.9.0","24.9.1","25.1.0","25.10.0","25.2.0","25.3.0","25.4.0","25.5.0","25.6.0","25.7.0","25.8.0","25.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65013.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-j8cq-7f6p-256x"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
