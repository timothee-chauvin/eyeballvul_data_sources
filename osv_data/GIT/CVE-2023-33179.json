  "details": "Xibo is a content management system (CMS). An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered starting in version 3.2.0 and prior to version 3.3.5 in the `nameFilter` function used throughout the CMS. This allows an authenticated user to exfiltrate data from the Xibo database by injecting specially crafted values for logical operators. Users should upgrade to version 3.3.5 which fixes this issue. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.",
