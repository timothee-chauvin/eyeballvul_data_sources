An attacker who can upload files of any type to the server can pass in the phar:// protocol to unserialize the uploaded file and instantiate arbitrary PHP objects. This can lead to remote code execution, especially when DOMPdf is used with frameworks with documented POP chains like Laravel or vulnerable developer code.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"99aeec1efec9213e87098d42eb09439e7ee0bb6a"}]}],"versions":["v0.6.0","v0.6.0-b3","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.7.0","v0.7.0-beta","v0.7.0-beta2","v0.7.0-beta3","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.8.5","v0.8.6","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-3838.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/0bdddc12-ff67-4815-ab9f-6011a974f48e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/commit/99aeec1efec9213e87098d42eb09439e7ee0bb6a"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
