{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-64745","published":"2025-11-13T20:26:13.261Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:40:31.848529Z","aliases":["GHSA-w2vj-39qv-7vh7"],"summary":"Astro development server error page vulnerable to reflected Cross-site Scripting","details":"Astro is a web framework. Starting in version 5.2.0 and prior to version 5.15.6, a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Astro's development server error pages when the `trailingSlash` configuration option is used. An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser context by crafting a malicious URL. While this vulnerability only affects the development server and not production builds, it could be exploited to compromise developer environments through social engineering or malicious links. Version 5.15.6 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/withastro/astro","events":[{"introduced":"f6b7839411233c95af529eb0eee098c24e1d9d80"},{"fixed":"190106149908ef6826899459146ef9f0ead602ab"}]}],"versions":["@astrojs/alpinejs@0.4.4","@astrojs/alpinejs@0.4.5","@astrojs/alpinejs@0.4.6","@astrojs/alpinejs@0.4.7","@astrojs/alpinejs@0.4.8","@astrojs/alpinejs@0.4.9","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.2.2","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.2.3","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.2.4","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.3.0","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.3.1","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.4.0","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.4.1","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.5.0","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.5.1","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.5.2","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.5.3","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.5.4","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.5.5","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.6.0","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.6.1","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.6.10","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.6.2","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.6.3","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.6.4","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.6.5","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.6.6","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.6.7","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.6.8","@astrojs/cloudflare@12.6.9","@astrojs/db@0.14.10","@astrojs/db@0.14.11","@astrojs/db@0.14.12","@astrojs/db@0.14.13","@astrojs/db@0.14.14","@astrojs/db@0.14.7","@astrojs/db@0.14.8","@astrojs/db@0.14.9","@astrojs/db@0.15.0","@astrojs/db@0.15.1","@astrojs/db@0.16.0","@astrojs/db@0.16.1","@astrojs/db@0.17.0","@astrojs/db@0.17.1","@astrojs/db@0.17.2","@astrojs/db@0.18.0","@astrojs/db@0.18.1","@astrojs/db@0.18.2","@astrojs/internal-helpers@0.5.0","@astrojs/internal-helpers@0.5.1","@astrojs/internal-helpers@0.6.0","@astrojs/internal-helpers@0.6.1","@astrojs/internal-helpers@0.7.0","@astrojs/internal-helpers@0.7.1","@astrojs/internal-helpers@0.7.2","@astrojs/internal-helpers@0.7.3","@astrojs/internal-helpers@0.7.4","@astrojs/language-server@2.16.0","@astrojs/markdoc@0.12.10","@astrojs/markdoc@0.12.11","@astrojs/markdoc@0.12.8","@astrojs/markdoc@0.12.9","@astrojs/markdoc@0.13.0","@astrojs/markdoc@0.13.2","@astrojs/markdoc@0.13.3","@astrojs/markdoc@0.13.4","@astrojs/markdoc@0.14.0","@astrojs/markdoc@0.14.1","@astrojs/markdoc@0.14.2","@astrojs/markdoc@0.15.0","@astrojs/markdoc@0.15.1","@astrojs/markdoc@0.15.2","@astrojs/markdoc@0.15.3","@astrojs/markdoc@0.15.4","@astrojs/markdoc@0.15.5","@astrojs/markdoc@0.15.6","@astrojs/markdoc@0.15.7","@astrojs/markdoc@0.15.8","@astrojs/markdown-remark@6.1.0","@astrojs/markdown-remark@6.2.0","@astrojs/markdown-remark@6.2.1","@astrojs/markdown-remark@6.3.0","@astrojs/markdown-remark@6.3.2","@astrojs/markdown-remark@6.3.3","@astrojs/markdown-remark@6.3.4","@astrojs/markdown-remark@6.3.5","@astrojs/markdown-remark@6.3.6","@astrojs/markdown-remark@6.3.7","@astrojs/markdown-remark@6.3.8","@astrojs/mdx@4.0.8","@astrojs/mdx@4.1.0","@astrojs/mdx@4.1.1","@astrojs/mdx@4.2.0","@astrojs/mdx@4.2.2","@astrojs/mdx@4.2.3","@astrojs/mdx@4.2.4","@astrojs/mdx@4.2.5","@astrojs/mdx@4.2.6","@astrojs/mdx@4.3.0","@astrojs/mdx@4.3.1","@astrojs/mdx@4.3.10","@astrojs/mdx@4.3.2","@astrojs/mdx@4.3.3","@astrojs/mdx@4.3.4","@astrojs/mdx@4.3.5","@astrojs/mdx@4.3.6","@astrojs/mdx@4.3.7","@astrojs/mdx@4.3.9","@astrojs/netlify@6.2.0","@astrojs/netlify@6.2.1","@astrojs/netlify@6.2.2","@astrojs/netlify@6.2.3","@astrojs/netlify@6.2.4","@astrojs/netlify@6.2.5","@astrojs/netlify@6.2.6","@astrojs/netlify@6.3.0","@astrojs/netlify@6.3.1","@astrojs/netlify@6.3.2","@astrojs/netlify@6.3.3","@astrojs/netlify@6.3.4","@astrojs/netlify@6.4.0","@astrojs/netlify@6.4.1","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.0","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.1","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.10","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.11","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.12","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.13","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.2","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.3","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.4","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.5","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.6","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.7","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.8","@astrojs/netlify@6.5.9","@astrojs/netlify@6.6.0","@astrojs/node@9.0.3","@astrojs/node@9.1.0","@astrojs/node@9.1.1","@astrojs/node@9.1.2","@astrojs/node@9.1.3","@astrojs/node@9.2.0","@astrojs/node@9.2.1","@astrojs/node@9.2.2","@astrojs/node@9.3.0","@astrojs/node@9.3.1","@astrojs/node@9.3.2","@astrojs/node@9.3.3","@astrojs/node@9.4.0","@astrojs/node@9.4.1","@astrojs/node@9.4.2","@astrojs/node@9.4.3","@astrojs/node@9.4.4","@astrojs/node@9.4.5","@astrojs/node@9.4.6","@astrojs/node@9.5.0","@astrojs/partytown@2.1.4","@astrojs/preact@4.0.10","@astrojs/preact@4.0.11","@astrojs/preact@4.0.4","@astrojs/preact@4.0.5","@astrojs/preact@4.0.6","@astrojs/preact@4.0.7","@astrojs/preact@4.0.8","@astrojs/preact@4.0.9","@astrojs/preact@4.1.0","@astrojs/preact@4.1.1","@astrojs/preact@4.1.2","@astrojs/preact@4.1.3","@astrojs/prism@3.3.0","@astrojs/react@4.2.1","@astrojs/react@4.2.2","@astrojs/react@4.2.3","@astrojs/react@4.2.4","@astrojs/react@4.2.5","@astrojs/react@4.2.6","@astrojs/react@4.2.7","@astrojs/react@4.3.0","@astrojs/react@4.3.1","@astrojs/react@4.4.0","@astrojs/react@4.4.1","@astrojs/react@4.4.2","@astrojs/rss@4.0.12","@astrojs/rss@4.0.13","@astrojs/sitemap@3.3.1","@astrojs/sitemap@3.4.0","@astrojs/sitemap@3.4.1","@astrojs/
