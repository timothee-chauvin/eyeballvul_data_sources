Prior to version 2.33.9, access tokens are used as GET parameters. The JSON Web Token (JWT) which is used as a session identifier will get leaked to anyone having access to the URLs accessed by the user. This will give an attacker full access to a user's account and, in consequence, to all sensitive files the user has access to. This issue has been patched in version 2.33.9.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a430eb2e60725eef42a121feadd0d114a5dd2b5a"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.2.9","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.10","v1.3.11","v1.3.12","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v1.4.0","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-rc.1","v2.0.0-rc.2","v2.0.1","v2.0.10","v2.0.11","v2.0.12","v2.0.13","v2.0.14","v2.0.15","v2.0.16","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.0.9","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.12.0","v2.12.1","v2.13.0","v2.14.0","v2.14.1","v2.15.0","v2.16.0","v2.16.1","v2.17.0","v2.17.1","v2.17.2","v2.18.0","v2.19.0","v2.2.0","v2.20.0","v2.20.1","v2.21.0","v2.21.1","v2.22.0","v2.22.1","v2.22.2","v2.22.3","v2.22.4","v2.23.0","v2.24.0","v2.24.1","v2.24.2","v2.25.0","v2.26.0","v2.27.0","v2.28.0","v2.29.0","v2.3.0","v2.30.0","v2.31.0","v2.31.1","v2.31.2","v2.32.0","v2.32.1","v2.32.2","v2.32.3","v2.33.0","v2.33.1","v2.33.2","v2.33.3","v2.33.4","v2.33.5","v2.33.6","v2.33.7","v2.33.8","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52901.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/52xxx/CVE-2025-52901.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/commit/d5b39a14fd3fc0d1c364116b41289484df7c27b2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/releases/tag/v2.33.9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/security/advisories/GHSA-rmwh-g367-mj4x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sbaresearch/advisories/tree/public/2025/SBA-ADV-20250327-03_Filebrowser_Sensitive_Data_Transferred_In_URL"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-52901"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-598"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/52xxx/CVE-2025-52901.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
