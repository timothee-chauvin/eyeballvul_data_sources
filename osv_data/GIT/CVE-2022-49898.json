'n' here is the number of items in this block, which in\nthis case was 1, but we had 2 REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING operations.\n\nThe actual root cause of this was that we were replaying operations for\na block that shouldn't have been replayed.  Consider the following\nsequence of events\n\n1. We have an already modified root, and we do a btrfs_get_tree_mod_seq().\n2. We begin removing items from this root, triggering KEY_REPLACE for\n   it's child slots.\n3. We remove one of the 2 children this root node points to, thus triggering\n   the root node promotion of the remaining child, and freeing this node.\n4. We modify a new root, and re-allocate the above node to the root node of\n   this other root.\n\nThe tree mod log looks something like this\n\n\tlogical 0\top KEY_REPLACE (slot 1)\t\t\tseq 2\n\tlogical 0\top KEY_REMOVE (slot 1)\t\t\tseq 3\n\tlogical 0\top KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING (slot 0)\tseq 4\n\tlogical 4096\top LOG_ROOT_REPLACE (old logical 0)\tseq 5\n\tlogical 8192\top KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING (slot 1)\tseq 6\n\tlogical 8192\top KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING (slot 0)\tseq 7\n\tlogical 0\top LOG_ROOT_REPLACE (old logical 8192)\tseq 8\n\n>From here the bug is triggered by the following steps\n\n1.  Call btrfs_get_old_root() on the new_root.\n2.  We call tree_mod_log_oldest_root(btrfs_root_node(new_root)), which is\n    currently logical 0.\n3.  tree_mod_log_oldest_root() calls tree_mod_log_search_oldest(), which\n    gives us the KEY_REPLACE seq 2, and since that's not a\n    LOG_ROOT_REPLACE we incorrectly believe that we don't have an old\n    root, because we expect that the most recent change should be a\n    LOG_ROOT_REPLACE.\n4.  Back in tree_mod_log_oldest_root() we don't have a LOG_ROOT_REPLACE,\n    so we don't set old_root, we simply use our
