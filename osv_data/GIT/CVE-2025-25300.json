{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-25300","published":"2025-02-18T17:38:52.088Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:34:30.758834Z","aliases":["GHSA-9mrq-cjgh-32g2"],"summary":"smartbanner.js rel noopener XSS vulnerability","details":"smartbanner.js is a customizable smart app banner for iOS and Android. Prior to version 1.14.1, clicking on smartbanner `View` link and navigating to 3rd party page leaves `window.opener` exposed. It may allow hostile third parties to abuse `window.opener`, e.g. by redirection or injection on the original page with smartbanner. `rel=\"noopener\"` is automatically populated to links as of `v1.14.1` which is a recommended upgrade to resolve the vulnerability. Some workarounds are available for those who cannot upgrade. Ensure `View` link is only taking users to App Store or Google Play Store where security is guarded by respective app store security teams. If `View` link is going to a third party page, limit smartbanner.js to be used on iOS that decreases the scope of the vulnerability since as of Safari 12.1,  `rel=\"noopener\"` is imposed on all `target=\"_blank\"` links. Version 1.14.1 of smartbanner.js contains a fix for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"90c6a341d541c4c00c004d97b112e4b39ad972aa"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v1.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-25300.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js/commit/fce8c31dfe04033d9d005a89694d3e7a60784f89"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js/security/advisories/GHSA-9mrq-cjgh-32g2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601","CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N/E:U"}]}
