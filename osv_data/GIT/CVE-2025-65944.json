From version 10.11.0 to before 10.27.0, when a Node.js application using the Sentry SDK has sendDefaultPii: true it is possible to inadvertently send certain sensitive HTTP headers, including the Cookie header, to Sentry. Those headers would be stored within a Sentry organization as part of the associated trace. A person with access to the Sentry organization could then view and use these sensitive values to impersonate or escalate their privileges within the application.
