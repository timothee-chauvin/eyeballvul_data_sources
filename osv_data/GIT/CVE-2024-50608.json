{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-50608","published":"2025-02-18T18:15:25Z","modified":"2025-10-22T04:45:31.592138Z","aliases":["BIT-fluent-bit-2024-50608"],"details":"An issue was discovered in Fluent Bit 3.1.9. When the Prometheus Remote Write input plugin is running and listening on an IP address and port, one can send a packet with Content-Length: 0 and it crashes the server. Improper handling of the case when Content-Length is 0 allows a user (with access to the endpoint) to perform a remote Denial of service attack. The crash happens because of a NULL pointer dereference when 0 (from the Content-Length) is passed to the function cfl_sds_len, which in turn tries to cast a NULL pointer into struct cfl_sds. This is related to process_payload_metrics_ng() at prom_rw_prot.c.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"431fa79ae27edaef8d050a7af6f038f4400193a1"}]}],"versions":["0.13-dev-0.10","0.13-dev-0.11","0.13-dev-0.12","0.13-dev-0.13","0.13-dev-0.14","0.13-dev-0.15","0.13-dev-0.16","0.13-dev-0.17","0.13-dev-0.18","0.13-dev-0.4","0.13-dev-0.5","0.13-dev-0.6","0.13-dev-0.7","0.13-dev-0.8","0.13-dev-0.9","ci-release-test","tiger-2.0.9-dev-20230104","unstable","unstable-master","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.12.3","v0.12.4","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.3","v0.4","v0.5","v0.5.1","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.9.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.7.0-rc2","v1.7.0-rc3","v1.7.0-rc4","v1.7.0-rc5","v1.7.0-rc6","v1.7.0-rc7","v1.7.0-rc8","v1.7.0-rc9","v1.8.0","v1.8.0-rc1","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-ci-test-1","v1.9.0-rc1","v1.9.0-rc2","v1.9.0-rc3","v1.9.0-rc4","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v1.9.6","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-rc1","v2.0.0-rc2","v2.0.0-rc3","v2.0.0pre","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.0.9","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-rc1","v2.1.0-rc2","v2.1.1","v2.1.10","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.1.5-windows-artifact-fix","v2.1.6","v2.1.7","v2.1.8","v2.1.9","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.1.4","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.1.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-50608.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/releases"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.ebryx.com/blogs/exploring-cve-2024-50608-and-cve-2024-50609"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://fluentbit.io/announcements/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
