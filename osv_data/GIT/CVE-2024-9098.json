  "details": "In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.4.30, a privilege escalation vulnerability exists where admins can invite new members with billing permissions, thereby gaining unauthorized access to billing resources. This issue arises because the user creation endpoint does not restrict admins from inviting users with billing roles. As a result, admins can circumvent the intended access control, posing a risk to the organization's financial resources.",
