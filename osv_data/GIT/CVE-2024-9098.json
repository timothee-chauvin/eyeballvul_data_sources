This issue arises because the user creation endpoint does not restrict admins from inviting users with billing roles. As a result, admins can circumvent the intended access control, posing a risk to the organization's financial resources.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a8d7b2959e87c30fbafdb12af7ffa093385dcc60"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-9098.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/75d466ae-8591-44d5-9160-eea7cad0c4fc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/a8d7b2959e87c30fbafdb12af7ffa093385dcc60"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
