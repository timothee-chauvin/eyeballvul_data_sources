Versions 3.6.13 and below and versions 3.7.0 through 3.7.4, contain unsafe untar code that handles symbolic links in archives. Concretely, the computation of a link's target and the subsequent check are flawed. An attacker can overwrite the file /var/run/argo/argoexec with a script of their choice, which would be executed at the pod's start. The patch deployed against CVE-2025-62156 is ineffective against malicious archives containing symbolic links. This issue is fixed in versions 3.6.14 and 3.7.5.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6b92af23f35aed4d4de8b04adcaf19d68f006de1"}]}],"versions":["ui-v3-rc1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha1","v2.0.0-alpha2","v2.0.0-alpha3","v2.0.0-beta1","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-alpha1","v2.1.0-beta1","v2.1.0-beta2","v2.1.1","v2.10.0-rc1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0-rc1","v2.3.0-rc2","v2.3.0-rc3","v3.1.0-rc1","v3.2.0-rc1","v3.2.0-rc2","v3.2.0-rc3","v3.2.0-rc4","v3.3.0-rc1","v3.3.0-rc2","v3.3.0-rc3","v3.3.0-rc4","v3.3.0-rc5","v3.3.0-rc6","v3.3.0-rc7","v3.3.0-rc8","v3.4.0-rc1","v3.4.0-rc2","v3.4.0-rc3","v3.4.0-rc4","v3.5.0","v3.5.0-rc1","v3.5.0-rc2","v3.6.0","v3.6.0-rc1","v3.6.0-rc2","v3.6.0-rc3","v3.6.0-rc4","v3.7.0-rc1","v3.7.0-rc2","v3.7.0-rc3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66626.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66626.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p84v-gxvw-73pf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/5291e0b01f94ba864f96f795bb500f2cfc5ad799/workflow/executor/executor.go#L1034-L1037"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/6b92af23f35aed4d4de8b04adcaf19d68f006de1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-xrqc-7xgx-c9vh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66626"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-23","CWE-78"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66626.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
