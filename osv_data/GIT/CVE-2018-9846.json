NOTE: this is less easily exploitable in 1.3.4 and later because of a Same Origin Policy protection mechanism.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail","events":[{"introduced":"1d7be448f309d33c6ad4252c0abf581402891f22"},{"last_affected":"8922e3e076b011d7756dd777b926c65be1e296bf"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-9846.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/6229"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/6238"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4181"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://medium.com/%40ndrbasi/cve-2018-9846-roundcube-303097048b0a"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
