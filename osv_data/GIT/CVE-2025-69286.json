{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-69286","published":"2025-12-31T21:52:54.304Z","modified":"2026-01-08T05:41:44.979144Z","aliases":["GHSA-9j5g-g4xm-57w7"],"summary":"RAGFlow has Predictable Token Generation Leading to Authentication Bypass Vulnerability","details":"RAGFlow is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine. In versions prior to 0.22.0, the use of an insecure key generation algorithm in the API key and beta (assistant/agent share auth) token generation process allows these tokens to be mutually derivable. Specifically, both tokens are generated using the same `URLSafeTimedSerializer` with predictable inputs, enabling an unauthorized user who obtains the shared assistant/agent URL to derive the personal API key. This grants them full control over the assistant/agent owner's account. Version 0.22.0 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a36a0fe71c58993d629016b3f3eab224e25be306"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.16.0","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.18.0","v0.19.1","v0.19.x","v0.2.0","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.20.3","v0.20.4","v0.20.5","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-69286.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/69xxx/CVE-2025-69286.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/blob/v0.20.5/api/apps/system_app.py#L214-L215"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/blob/v0.20.5/api/utils/__init__.py#L343"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/blob/v0.20.5/api/utils/api_utils.py#L378"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/commit/a3bb4aadcc3494fb27f2a9933b4c46df8eb532e6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/security/advisories/GHSA-9j5g-g4xm-57w7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69286"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-340"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/69xxx/CVE-2025-69286.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
