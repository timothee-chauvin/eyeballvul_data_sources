{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53759","published":"2025-12-08T01:19:20.432Z","modified":"2025-12-08T03:12:05.321854Z","summary":"HID: hidraw: fix data race on device refcount","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: hidraw: fix data race on device refcount\n\nThe hidraw_open() function increments the hidraw device reference\ncounter. The counter has no dedicated synchronization mechanism,\nresulting in a potential data race when concurrently opening a device.\n\nThe race is a regression introduced by commit 8590222e4b02 (\"HID:\nhidraw: Replace hidraw device table mutex with a rwsem\"). While\nminors_rwsem is intended to protect the hidraw_table itself, by instead\nacquiring the lock for writing, the reference counter is also protected.\nThis is symmetrical to hidraw_release().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"8590222e4b021054a7167a4dd35b152a8ed7018e"},{"fixed":"879e79c3aead41b8aa2e91164354b30bd1c4ef3b"},{"fixed":"ff348eabd97577da974d3db7038857f28c61d2bd"},{"fixed":"05b47034e2488c2924e5c032e20a1979d012b5b5"},{"fixed":"944ee77dc6ec7b0afd8ec70ffc418b238c92f12b"}]}],"versions":["v5.16","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.3.1","v6.3.10","v6.3.2","v6.3.3","v6.3.4","v6.3.5","v6.3.6","v6.3.7","v6.3.8","v6.3.9","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53759.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.37"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.3.11"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.4.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53759.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/05b47034e2488c2924e5c032e20a1979d012b5b5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/879e79c3aead41b8aa2e91164354b30bd1c4ef3b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/944ee77dc6ec7b0afd8ec70ffc418b238c92f12b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ff348eabd97577da974d3db7038857f28c61d2bd"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53759.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53759"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53759.json"}}
