It's confusing\nto use xas_nomem() to free memory in this context, so call xas_destroy()\ninstead.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"6b24ca4a1a8d4ee3221d6d44ddbb99f542e4bda3"},{"fixed":"c0c84962e297927ba57fd6ddc2bb000c9d149655"},{"fixed":"95c8181b4947e000f3b9b8e5918d899fce77b93d"},{"fixed":"69a37a8ba1b408a1c7616494aa7018e4b3844cbe"}]}],"versions":["v5.16","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.17.1","v5.17.10","v5.17.11","v5.17.12","v5.17.13","v5.17.14","v5.17.2","v5.17.3","v5.17.4","v5.17.5","v5.17.6","v5.17.7","v5.17.8","v5.17.9","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.18.1","v5.18.2","v5.18.3","v5.19-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49334.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"5.17.15"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.18.0"},{"fixed":"5.18.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49334.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/69a37a8ba1b408a1c7616494aa7018e4b3844cbe"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/95c8181b4947e000f3b9b8e5918d899fce77b93d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c0c84962e297927ba57fd6ddc2bb000c9d149655"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49334.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49334"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49334.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
