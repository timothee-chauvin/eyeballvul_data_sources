This may lead to unexpected syntactic changes during XML processing in some downstream applications. This is fixed in version 0.5.0. As a workaround downstream applications can validate the input and reject the maliciously crafted documents.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d4201b9dfbf760049f457f9f08a3888d48835135"},{"fixed":"f763b002fb01d3e58010b04be35a3be50f9777e8"}]}],"versions":["0.2.0","0.2.1","0.3.0","0.4.0","v0.1.16","v0.1.27","v0.1.28-not-published","v0.1.28-xmldom-alpha","xmldom-aplha@v0.1.28"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-21366.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/releases/tag/0.5.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/security/advisories/GHSA-h6q6-9hqw-rwfv"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00000.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/commit/d4201b9dfbf760049f457f9f08a3888d48835135"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmldom"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
