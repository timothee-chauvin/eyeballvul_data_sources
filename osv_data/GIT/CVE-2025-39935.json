This leads to memory corruption when we copy data\nit on the next line:\n\n        memcpy(sma1307->set.header, data,\n               sma1307->set.header_size * sizeof(int));\n\nAlso since we're immediately copying over the memory in ->set.header,\nthere is no need to zero it in the allocator.  Use devm_kmalloc_array()\nto allocate the memory instead.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"576c57e6b4c1d734bcb7cc33dde9a99a9383b520"},{"fixed":"cd59ca8f75dbb42a67fcae975c766114644e36c4"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"576c57e6b4c1d734bcb7cc33dde9a99a9383b520"},{"fixed":"78338108b5a856dc98223a335f147846a8a18c51"}]}],"versions":["v6.12","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.16.1","v6.16.2","v6.16.3","v6.16.4","v6.16.5","v6.16.6","v6.16.7","v6.16.8","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39935.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39935.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/78338108b5a856dc98223a335f147846a8a18c51"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cd59ca8f75dbb42a67fcae975c766114644e36c4"}]}
