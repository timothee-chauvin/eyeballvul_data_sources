{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-67646","published":"2025-12-10T23:45:02.225Z","modified":"2025-12-14T04:49:27.232245Z","aliases":["GHSA-j24f-hw6w-cq78"],"summary":"TableProgressTracking's missing CSRF protection allows unauthorized state changes","details":"TableProgressTracking is a MediaWiki extension to track progress against specific criterion. Versions 1.2.0 and below do not enforce CSRF token validation in the REST API. As a result, an attacker could craft a malicious webpage that, when visited by an authenticated user on a wiki with the extension enabled, would trigger unintended authenticated actions through the victim's browser. Due to the lack of token validation, an attacker can delete or track progress against tables. This issue is patched in version 1.2.1 of the extension.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/telepedia/tableprogresstracking","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e2aa8c4b3bb78989c6fe39070a95a26d22b91c94"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67646.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67646.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Telepedia/TableProgressTracking/commit/e2aa8c4b3bb78989c6fe39070a95a26d22b91c94"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Telepedia/TableProgressTracking/security/advisories/GHSA-j24f-hw6w-cq78"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67646"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-352"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67646.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
