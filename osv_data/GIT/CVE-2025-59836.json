Prior to 1.1.5 and 1.0.2, there is a nil pointer dereference vulnerability in the Omni Resource Service allows unauthenticated users to cause a server panic and denial of service by sending empty create/update resource requests through the API endpoints. The vulnerability exists in the isSensitiveSpec function which calls grpcomni.CreateResource without checking if the resource's metadata field is nil. When a resource is created with an empty Metadata field, the CreateResource function attempts to access resource.Metadata.Version causing a segmentation fault. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.1.5 and 1.0.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/siderolabs/omni","events":[{"introduced":"98d2e409a26d8da4ad9f3a2a050de398321b1da7"},{"fixed":"8505bfa68b6e4abd66b8ce6b48e62484e35cb9b7"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.1.0-beta.0"},{"fixed":"1.1.5"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/siderolabs/omni","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0538193f31425e2d459a3ca07e698e07b7383500"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.2"}]}}],"versions":["client/v0.48.0-beta.0","client/v0.51.0-beta.0","client/v0.51.0-beta.1","client/v1.0.0","client/v1.0.1","client/v1.1.0","client/v1.1.2","v0.33.0-beta.0","v0.34.0-beta.0","v0.35.0-beta.0","v0.36.0-beta.0","v0.37.0-beta.0","v0.38.0-beta.0","v0.39.0-beta.0","v0.40.0-beta.0","v0.41.0-beta.0","v0.42.0-beta.0","v0.43.0","v0.43.0-beta.0","v0.44.0-beta.0","v0.45.0-beta.0","v0.46.0-beta.0","v0.47.0-beta.0","v0.47.0-beta.1","v0.48.0-beta.0","v0.49.0-beta.0","v0.50.0-beta.0","v0.51.0-beta.0","v0.51.0-beta.1","v0.51.0-beta.2","v0.52.0-beta.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-beta.0","v1.0.0-beta.1","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-beta.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59836.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/siderolabs/omni/commit/1396083f766a1b0380e9949968d7fc17b7afecaa"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/siderolabs/omni/commit/1fd954af64985a8b3dbf5b11deddbf7cd953f5ae"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/siderolabs/omni/security/advisories/GHSA-4p3p-cr38-v5xp"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476","CWE-703"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
