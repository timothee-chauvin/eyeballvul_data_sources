{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-54224","published":"2025-12-30T12:11:18.076Z","modified":"2026-01-05T21:23:33.182706Z","summary":"btrfs: fix lockdep splat and potential deadlock after failure running delayed items","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix lockdep splat and potential deadlock after failure running delayed items\n\nWhen running delayed items we are holding a delayed node's mutex and then\nwe will attempt to modify a subvolume btree to insert/update/delete the\ndelayed items. However if have an error during the insertions for example,\nbtrfs_insert_delayed_items() may return with a path that has locked extent\nbuffers (a leaf at the very least), and then we attempt to release the\ndelayed node at __btrfs_run_delayed_items(), which requires taking the\ndelayed node's mutex, causing an ABBA type of deadlock. This was reported\nby syzbot and the lockdep splat is the following:\n\n  WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected\n  6.5.0-rc7-syzkaller-00024-g93f5de5f648d #0 Not tainted\n
