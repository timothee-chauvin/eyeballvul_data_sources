{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-32772","published":"2021-08-03T15:15:08.503Z","modified":"2025-11-20T11:44:31.083516Z","related":["GHSA-wjmh-9fj2-rqh6"],"details":"Poddycast is a podcast app made with Electron. Prior to version 0.8.1, an attacker can create a podcast or episode with malicious characters and execute commands on the client machine. The application does not clean the HTML characters of the podcast information obtained from the Feed, which allows the injection of HTML and JS code (cross-site scripting). Being an application made in electron, cross-site scripting can be scaled to remote code execution, making it possible to execute commands on the machine where the application is running. The vulnerability is patched in Poddycast version 0.8.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mrchuckomo/poddycast","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"8d31daa5cee04a389ec35f974959ea3fe4638be9"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.7.0","v0.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32772.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/MrChuckomo/poddycast/blob/8d31daa5cee04a389ec35f974959ea3fe4638be9/app/js/favorite.js#L4-L14"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/MrChuckomo/poddycast/blob/8d31daa5cee04a389ec35f974959ea3fe4638be9/app/js/feed.js#L285"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/MrChuckomo/poddycast/blob/8d31daa5cee04a389ec35f974959ea3fe4638be9/app/js/helper/helper_entries.js#L80"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/MrChuckomo/poddycast/security/advisories/GHSA-wjmh-9fj2-rqh6"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
