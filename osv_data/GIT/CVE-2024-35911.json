This is caused\nfrom the driver *only* calling the ice_vsi_free_q_vectors() function by\nitself, when it is suspending. Since commit b3e7b3a6ee92 (\"ice: prevent\nNULL pointer deref during reload\") the driver has zeroed out\nnum_q_vectors, and only restored it in ice_vsi_cfg_def().\n\nThis further causes the ice_rebuild() function to allocate a zero length\nbuffer, after which num_q_vectors is updated, and then the new value of\nnum_q_vectors is used to index into the zero length buffer, which\ncorrupts memory.\n\nThe fix entails making sure all the code referencing num_q_vectors only\ndoes so after it has been reset via ice_vsi_cfg_def().\n\nI didn't perform a full bisect, but I was able to test against 6.1.77\nkernel and that ice driver works fine for suspend/resume with no panic,\nso sometime since then, this problem was introduced.\n\nAlso clean up an un-needed init of a local variable in the function\nbeing modified.\n\nPANIC from 6.8.0-rc1:\n\n[1026674.915596] PM: suspend exit\n[1026675.664697] ice 0000:17:00.1: PTP reset successful\n[1026675.664707] ice 0000:17:00.1: 2755 msecs
