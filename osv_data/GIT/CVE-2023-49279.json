{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-49279","published":"2023-12-12T19:35:05.931Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:28:13.769041Z","aliases":["GHSA-6xmx-85x3-4cv2"],"summary":"Umbraco CMS vulnerable to stored XSS via SVG File Upload","details":"Umbraco is an ASP.NET content management system (CMS). Starting in version 7.0.0 and prior to versions 7.15.11, 8.18.9, 10.7.0, 11.5.0, and 12.2.0, a user with access to the backoffice can upload SVG files that include scripts. If the user can trick another user to load the media directly in a browser, the scripts can be executed. Versions 7.15.11, 8.18.9, 10.7.0, 11.5.0, and 12.2.0 contain a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Implement the server side file validation or serve all media from an different host (e.g cdn) than where Umbraco is hosted.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/umbraco/umbraco-cms","events":[{"introduced":"f916a6bc18d2dfe6efafaa2b9d040f40b8c61a31"},{"fixed":"bd60f4e2cea7ace2984dcfb8e61ef6512ea77c73"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"7.0.0"},{"fixed":"7.15.11"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/umbraco/umbraco-cms","events":[{"introduced":"b8db430615d76521a4394a23f9928dc7c12f87bd"},{"fixed":"dac9986ed28b798400ced60d1b055771f6b973e1"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"8.0.0"},{"fixed":"8.18.9"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/umbraco/umbraco-cms","events":[{"introduced":"4f06c1f33a54daf4752a439778626202960db68c"},{"fixed":"fd043f6ecf7b45aea1ec4dfdf2097c5673b0bff5"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"9.0.0-rc001"},{"fixed":"10.7.0"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/umbraco/umbraco-cms","events":[{"introduced":"38712dce16aa9412af3d81d4884bfc6e5533e019"},{"fixed":"147b46440fa5ba399838ff2f8aaf115518e7ad41"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"11.0.0-rc1"},{"fixed":"11.5.0"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/umbraco/umbraco-cms","events":[{"introduced":"a4202f352aabbf230b300fad389c8ebefe4c2b6c"},{"fixed":"173d8dcf47fcd18584b80190db14144a363cbdd5"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"12.0.0-rc1"},{"fixed":"12.2.0"}]}}],"versions":["release-10.0.0","release-10.0.0-rc1","release-10.0.0-rc2","release-10.0.0-rc3","release-10.0.0-rc4","release-10.0.0-rc5","release-10.0.1","release-10.1.0","release-10.1.0-rc","release-10.1.0-rc2","release-10.2.0","release-10.2.0-rc","release-10.2.1","release-10.3.0","release-10.3.0-rc","release-10.3.1","release-10.3.2","release-10.4.0-rc1","release-10.4.1","release-10.5.0","release-10.5.0-rc","release-10.6.0","release-10.6.0-rc","release-10.6.1","release-10.7.0-rc","release-11.0.0","release-11.0.0-rc1","release-11.0.0-rc2","release-11.0.0-rc3","release-11.0.0-rc4","release-11.0.0-rc5","release-11.0.0-rc6","release-11.1.0-rc1","release-11.2.0","release-11.2.0-rc","release-11.2.1","release-11.3.0","release-11.3.0-rc","release-11.4.0","release-11.4.0-rc","release-11.4.1","release-11.4.2","release-11.5.0-rc","release-12.0.0","release-12.0.0-rc1","release-12.0.0-rc2","release-12.0.0-rc3","release-12.0.0-rc4","release-12.0.0-rc5","release-12.0.1","release-12.1.0","release-12.1.0-rc","release-12.1.1","release-12.1.2","release-12.2.0-rc","release-8.14.1","release-8.14.2","release-8.14.3","release-8.14.4","release-8.15.0","release-8.15.1","release-8.15.2","release-8.15.3","release-8.16.0","release-8.16.0-rc","release-8.17.0","release-8.17.0-rc","release-8.17.0-rc2","release-8.17.1","release-8.17.2","release-8.18.0-rc","release-9.0.0","release-9.0.0-rc001","release-9.0.0-rc002","release-9.0.0-rc003","release-9.0.0-rc004","release-9.0.1","release-9.1.0","release-9.1.0-rc","release-9.1.1","release-9.1.2","release-9.2.0","release-9.2.0-rc","release-9.3.0","release-9.3.0-rc","release-9.3.1","release-9.4.0","release-9.4.0-rc","release-9.4.1","release-9.4.2","release-9.5.0","release-9.5.0-rc","release-9.5.0-rc2","release-9.5.0-rc3","release-9.5.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-49279.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/reference/security/serverside-file-validation"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-6xmx-85x3-4cv2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
