Versions prior to 0.1.5 are vulnerable to Relative Path Traversal when scanning a specially-crafted local PyPI package. Running GuardDog against a specially-crafted package can allow an attacker to write an arbitrary file on the machine where GuardDog is executed due to a path traversal vulnerability when extracting the .tar.gz file of the package being scanned, which exists by design in the tarfile.TarFile.extractall function. This issue is patched in version 0.1.5.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/datadog/guarddog","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"98af5c8c1e9c15fa888c900252e76116b0ec25d1"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23531.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/DataDog/guarddog/pull/89/commits/a56aff58264cb6b7855d71b00dc10c39a5dbd306"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/DataDog/guarddog/releases/tag/v0.1.5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DataDog/guarddog/security/advisories/GHSA-rp2v-v467-q9vq"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-23"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
