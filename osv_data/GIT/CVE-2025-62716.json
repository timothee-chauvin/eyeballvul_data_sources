Prior to version 1.1.0, an open redirect vulnerability in the ?next_path query parameter allows attackers to supply arbitrary schemes (e.g., javascript:) that are passed directly to router.push. This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victimâ€™s browser. The issue can be exploited without authentication and has severe impact, including information disclosure, and privilege escalation and modifications of administrative settings. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/makeplane/plane","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e710f5b278ed114b7e1f252333c129e885692e4b"}]}],"versions":["v0.1-dev","v0.10-dev","v0.11-dev","v0.12-dev","v0.12.1-dev","v0.12.2-dev","v0.13-dev","v0.13.1-dev","v0.13.2-dev","v0.14-dev","v0.14.1-dev","v0.14.2-dev","v0.15-dev","v0.15.1-dev","v0.15.2-dev","v0.15.3-hotfix","v0.15.4-dev","v0.16-dev","v0.17-dev","v0.18-dev","v0.19-dev","v0.2-dev","v0.2.1-dev","v0.20-dev","v0.21-dev","v0.22-dev","v0.23.0","v0.23.1","v0.24.0","v0.24.1","v0.25.0","v0.25.1","v0.25.2","v0.25.3","v0.26.0","v0.26.1","v0.27.0","v0.27.1","v0.28.0","v0.3.1-dev","v0.4-dev","v0.5-dev","v0.6-dev","v0.7-dev","v0.7.1-dev","v0.8-dev","v0.9-dev","v1.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62716.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/makeplane/plane/security/advisories/GHSA-6fj7-xgpg-mj6f"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601","CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
