{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-24822","published":"2023-04-24T15:24:26.836Z","modified":"2025-11-19T19:53:32.740042Z","aliases":["GHSA-8x69-5fhj-72wh"],"summary":"RIOT-OS vulnerable to Null Pointer dereference during IPHC encoding","details":"RIOT-OS, an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices, contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. Prior to version 2022.10, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a NULL pointer dereference while encoding a 6LoWPAN IPHC header. The NULL pointer dereference causes a hard fault exception, leading to denial of service. Version 2022.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, apply the patches manually.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/riot-os/riot","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"365fbed906226dc36f50b0929e07426acbcc1e7d"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2022.10"}]}}],"versions":["2013.08","2014.01","2014.05","2014.12","2015.09-RC1","2015.12-RC1","2015.12-devel","2016.03-devel","2016.04-RC1","2016.07-RC1","2016.07-RC2","2016.07-devel","2016.10-RC1","2016.10-devel","2017.01-RC1","2017.01-devel","2017.04-RC1","2017.04-devel","2017.07-RC1","2017.07-devel","2017.10-RC1","2017.10-devel","2018.01-RC1","2018.01-devel","2018.04-RC1","2018.04-devel","2018.07-RC1","2018.07-devel","2018.10-RC1","2018.10-devel","2019.01-RC1","2019.01-devel","2019.04-RC1","2019.04-devel","2019.07-RC1","2019.07-devel","2019.10-RC1","2019.10-devel","2020.01-RC1","2020.01-devel","2020.04-RC1","2020.04-devel","2020.07-RC1","2020.07-devel","2020.10-RC1","2020.10-devel","2021.01-RC1","2021.01-devel","2021.04-RC1","2021.04-devel","2021.07-RC1","2021.07-devel","2021.10-RC1","2021.10-devel","2022.01-RC1","2022.01-devel","2022.04-RC1","2022.04-devel","2022.07-devel"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-24822.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/639c04325de4ceb9d444955f4927bfae95843a39"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/7253e261556f252816f4a3b7c4f96fc10d642485"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-8x69-5fhj-72wh"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
