{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68400","published":"2025-12-17T21:42:21.150Z","modified":"2025-12-18T21:00:48.143240Z","aliases":["GHSA-v54g-2pvg-gvp2"],"summary":"ChurchCRM vulnerable to time-based blind SQL Injection in ConfirmReportEmail.php","details":"ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. A SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the legacy endpoint `/Reports/ConfirmReportEmail.php` in ChurchCRM prior to version 6.5.3. Although the feature was removed from the UI, the file remains deployed and reachable directly via URL. This is a classic case of *dead but reachable code*. Any authenticated user - including one with zero assigned permissions - can exploit SQL injection through the `familyId` parameter. Version 6.5.3 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/churchcrm/crm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"472e38155ef4bf5af183c591bcbcdb7969879985"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.5.3"}]}}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.0.1","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.10","2.1.11","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.1.7","2.1.9","2.10.0","2.10.1","2.10.2","2.10.3","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.2.4","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.3.5","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.7.2","2.7.3","2.7.4","2.7.5","2.8.0","2.8.0-RC1","2.8.0-RC2","2.8.1","2.8.10","2.8.11","2.8.12","2.8.13","2.8.14","2.8.15","2.8.2","2.8.3","2.8.4","2.8.5","2.8.6","2.8.7","2.8.8","2.8.9","2.9.0","2.9.0-RC1","2.9.1","2.9.2","2.9.3","2.9.4","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.10","3.0.11","3.0.12","3.0.13","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.8","3.0.9","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.2.4","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.3.2","3.4.0","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.5.2","3.5.3","3.5.4","3.5.5","4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.0.4","4.0.5","4.1.0","4.1.1","4.1.2","4.1.3","4.1.4","4.2.0","4.2.1","4.2.2","4.2.3","4.3.0","4.3.1","4.3.2","4.4.0","4.4.1","4.4.2","4.4.3","4.4.4","4.4.5","4.5.0","4.5.1","4.5.2","4.5.3","4.5.4","5.0.0","5.0.0-beta1","5.0.0-beta2","5.0.1","5.0.2","5.0.3","5.0.4","5.0.5","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.10.0","5.11.0","5.12.0","5.13.0","5.14.0","5.15.0","5.16.0","5.17.0","5.18.0","5.19.0","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.2.2","5.2.3","5.21.0","5.22.0","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.4.0","5.4.1","5.4.2","5.4.3","5.5.0","5.6.0","5.7.0","5.8.0","5.9.1","5.9.2","5.9.3","6.0.0","6.0.1","6.0.2","6.1.0","6.2.0","6.3.0","6.4.0","6.5.0","6.5.1","6.5.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68400.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68400.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/security/advisories/GHSA-v54g-2pvg-gvp2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68400"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-89"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68400.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
