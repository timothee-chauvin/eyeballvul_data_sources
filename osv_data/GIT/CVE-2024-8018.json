When uploading a file, if an attacker appends a large number of characters to the end of a multipart boundary, the system will continuously process these characters, rendering privateGPT inaccessible. This uncontrolled resource consumption can lead to prolonged unavailability of the service, disrupting operations and causing potential data inaccessibility and loss of productivity.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"94ef38cbba8fe5e406eb192efafe774b9aadb564"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-8018.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/0661fa3b-bea4-4156-abed-a65d51958505"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
