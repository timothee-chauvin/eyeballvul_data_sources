Prior to versions 6.2.7 and 7.0.0, an attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Lua script can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result with a crash of the redis-server process. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/redis/redis","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e6f67092f8d4d81761a60c46011d1ff1dc3c2628"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.2.7"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/redis/redis","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d375595d5e3ae2e5c29e6c00a2dc3d60578fd9fc"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.0.0"}]}}],"versions":["1.3.6","2.2-alpha0","2.2-alpha1","2.2-alpha2","2.2-alpha3","2.2-alpha4","2.2-alpha5","2.2-alpha6","2.2.0-rc1","2.3-alpha0","3.0-alpha0","6.2-rc1","6.2-rc2","6.2-rc3","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.2.2","6.2.3","6.2.4","6.2.5","6.2.6","7.0-rc1","7.0-rc2","7.0-rc3","v1.3.10","v1.3.11","v1.3.12","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v2.0.0-rc1","v2.1.1-watch","vm-playpen","with-deprecated-diskstore"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24736.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10651"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.2.7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.0.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-3qpw-7686-5984"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J4ZK3675DGHVVDOFLJN7WX6YYH27GPMK/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VPYKSG7LKUJGVM2P72EHXKVRVRWHLORX/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WSTPUCAPBRHIFPSCOURR4OYX4E2OISAF/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-17"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220715-0003/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
