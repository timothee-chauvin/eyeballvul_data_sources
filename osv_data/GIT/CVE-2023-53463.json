{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53463","published":"2025-10-01T11:42:34Z","modified":"2025-10-21T17:04:53.396430Z","related":["SUSE-SU-2025:03615-1","SUSE-SU-2025:03628-1"],"summary":"ibmvnic: Do not reset dql stats on NON_FATAL err","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nibmvnic: Do not reset dql stats on NON_FATAL err\n\nAll ibmvnic resets, make a call to netdev_tx_reset_queue() when\nre-opening the device. netdev_tx_reset_queue() resets the num_queued\nand num_completed byte counters. These stats are used in Byte Queue\nLimit (BQL) algorithms. The difference between these two stats tracks\nthe number of bytes currently sitting on the physical NIC. ibmvnic\nincreases the number of queued bytes though calls to\nnetdev_tx_sent_queue() in the drivers xmit function. When, VIOS reports\nthat it is done transmitting bytes, the ibmvnic device increases the\nnumber of completed bytes through calls to netdev_tx_completed_queue().\nIt is important to note that the driver batches its transmit calls and\nnum_queued is increased every time that an skb is added to the next\nbatch, not necessarily when the batch is sent to VIOS for transmission.\n\nUnlike other reset types, a NON FATAL reset will not flush the sub crq\ntx buffers. Therefore, it is possible for the batched skb array to be\npartially full. So if there is call to netdev_tx_reset_queue() when\nre-opening the device, the value of num_queued (0) would not account\nfor the skb's that are currently batched. Eventually, when the batch\nis sent to VIOS, the call to netdev_tx_completed_queue() would increase\nnum_completed to a value greater than the num_queued. This causes a\nBUG_ON crash:\n\nibmvnic 30000002: Firmware reports error, cause: adapter problem.\nStarting recovery...\nibmvnic 30000002: tx error 600\nibmvnic 30000002: tx error 600\nibmvnic
