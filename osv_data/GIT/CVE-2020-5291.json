This can in turn be used to gain root permissions. Note that this only affects the combination of bubblewrap in setuid mode (which is typically used when unprivileged user namespaces are not supported) and the support of unprivileged user namespaces. Known to be affected are: * Debian testing/unstable, if unprivileged user namespaces enabled (not default) * Debian buster-backports, if unprivileged user namespaces enabled (not default) * Arch if using `linux-hardened`, if unprivileged user namespaces enabled (not default) * Centos 7 flatpak COPR, if unprivileged user namespaces enabled (not default) This has been fixed in the 0.4.1 release, and all affected users should update.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1f7e2ad948c051054b683461885a0215f1806240"}]}],"versions":["0.1.2","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-5291.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5feb64dc60c936a7f9e424df9478aae9b88ee48a"}]}],"versions":["0.1.2","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-5291.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/commit/1f7e2ad948c051054b683461885a0215f1806240"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/security/advisories/GHSA-j2qp-rvxj-43vj"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
