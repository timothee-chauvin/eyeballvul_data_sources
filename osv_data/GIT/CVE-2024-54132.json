A security vulnerability has been identified in GitHub CLI that could create or overwrite files in unintended directories when users download a malicious GitHub Actions workflow artifact through gh run download. This vulnerability stems from a GitHub Actions workflow artifact named .. when downloaded using gh run download. The artifact name and --dir flag are used to determine the artifact’s download path. When the artifact is named .., the resulting files within the artifact are extracted exactly 1 directory higher than the specified --dir flag value. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.63.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cli/cli","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1136764c369aaf0cae4ec2ee09dc35d871076932"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.12.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.5.7","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.14.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.11.0","v2.11.1","v2.11.2","v2.11.3","v2.12.0","v2.12.1","v2.13.0","v2.14.0","v2.14.1","v2.14.2","v2.14.3","v2.14.4","v2.14.5","v2.14.6","v2.14.7","v2.15.0","v2.16.0","v2.16.1","v2.17.0","v2.18.0","v2.18.1","v2.19.0","v2.2.0","v2.20.0","v2.20.1","v2.20.2","v2.21.0","v2.21.1","v2.21.2","v2.22.0","v2.22.1","v2.23.0","v2.24.0","v2.24.1","v2.24.2","v2.24.3","v2.25.0","v2.25.1","v2.26.0","v2.26.1","v2.27.0","v2.29.0","v2.3.0","v2.30.0","v2.31.0","v2.32.0","v2.32.1","v2.33.0","v2.34.0","v2.35.0","v2.36.0","v2.37.0","v2.38.0","v2.39.0","v2.39.1","v2.39.2","v2.4.0","v2.40.0","v2.40.1","v2.41.0","v2.42.0","v2.42.1","v2.43.0","v2.43.1","v2.44.0","v2.44.1","v2.45.0","v2.46.0","v2.47.0","v2.48.0","v2.49.0","v2.49.1","v2.49.2","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v2.50.0","v2.51.0","v2.52.0","v2.53.0","v2.54.0","v2.55.0","v2.56.0","v2.57.0","v2.58.0","v2.59.0","v2.6.0","v2.60.0","v2.60.1","v2.61.0","v2.62.0","v2.63.0","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-54132.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cli/cli/commit/1136764c369aaf0cae4ec2ee09dc35d871076932"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-2m9h-r57g-45pj"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/U:Green"}]}
