An attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the following two scenarios: a victim visits a malicious website controlled by the attacker and the website redirect to the URL automatically, or a victim clicks on such a crafted link embedded on a legitimate website (e.g., in user-generated content). In both cases, the browser invokes Dive's custom URL handler (dive:), which launches the Dive app and processes the crafted URL, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victimâ€™s machine. This vulnerability is caused by improper processing of custom url. This is fixed in version 0.9.4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openagentplatform/dive","events":[{"introduced":"f703c37068fe1ea28d8787793f178df1cc3f0d2c"},{"fixed":"d761ff938a0f25f99b7344e56220349773936e65"}]}],"versions":["v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58176.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenAgentPlatform/Dive/security/advisories/GHSA-2r34-7pgx-vvrc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenAgentPlatform/Dive/commit/acae6d40354d380f69f8241e9122a43ff64cff11"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
