{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-48881","published":"2025-05-30T05:21:30Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:47:23.212019Z","aliases":["GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p"],"summary":"Valtimo backend libraries allows objects in the object-api to be accessed and modified by unauthorized users","details":"Valtimo is a platform for Business Process Automation. In versions starting from 11.0.0.RELEASE to 11.3.3.RELEASE and 12.0.0.RELEASE to 12.12.0.RELEASE, all objects for which an object-management configuration exists can be listed, viewed, edited, created or deleted by unauthorised users. If object-urls are exposed via other channels, the contents of these objects can be viewed independent of object-management configurations. This issue has been patched in version 12.13.0.RELEASE.  A workaround for this issue involves overriding the endpoint security as defined in ObjectenApiHttpSecurityConfigurer and ObjectManagementHttpSecurityConfigurer. Depending on the implementation, this could result in loss of functionality.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries","events":[{"introduced":"d16803d67d2f6bc793eeaf217c963fd165d06ab0"},{"last_affected":"7d7397f4057605bce52fca6c6e1eb013987ae60d"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries","events":[{"introduced":"ff776b43dba8e33a99d3157c89cb5970a8f40d47"},{"fixed":"c1b6271160d1625718b2564921afe8162ec40b50"}]}],"versions":["11.3.2.RELEASE","12.0.0.RELEASE","12.11.0.RELEASE","12.8.0.RELEASE","12.9.0.RELEASE"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48881.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/commit/6ab04b30d3dab816bfea32d40ba50e5dd4517272"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-863"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
