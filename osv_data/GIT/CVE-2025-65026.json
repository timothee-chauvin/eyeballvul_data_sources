{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-65026","published":"2025-11-19T17:33:11.469Z","modified":"2025-11-21T08:52:03.407841Z","aliases":["GHSA-hcpf-qv9m-vfgp"],"summary":"esm.sh CDN service has JS Template Literal Injection in CSS-to-JavaScript","details":"esm.sh is a nobuild content delivery network(CDN) for modern web development. Prior to version 136, The esm.sh CDN service contains a Template Literal Injection vulnerability (CWE-94) in its CSS-to-JavaScript module conversion feature. When a CSS file is requested with the ?module query parameter, esm.sh converts it to a JavaScript module by embedding the CSS content directly into a template literal without proper sanitization. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code using ${...} expressions within CSS files, which will execute when the module is imported by victim applications. This enables Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in browsers and Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Electron applications. This issue has been patched in version 136.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/esm-dev/esm.sh","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1ad31b6352bb0a064ece812f6f360e4850e16051"}]}],"versions":["v100","v101","v102","v103","v104","v105","v106","v107","v108","v109","v110","v111","v112","v113","v114","v115","v116","v117","v119","v120","v121","v122","v123","v124","v125","v126","v127","v128","v129","v130","v131","v132","v133","v134","v135","v135_1","v34","v35","v37","v38","v39","v40","v41","v43","v44","v45","v46","v47","v49","v50","v51","v52","v53","v55","v56","v57","v59","v60","v61","v62","v63","v64","v65","v66","v67","v68","v69","v70","v71","v72","v73","v74","v75","v76","v77","v78","v79","v80","v81","v82","v83","v84","v85","v86","v87","v88","v89","v90","v91","v92","v93","v94","v95","v96","v97","v98","v99"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65026.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/esm-dev/esm.sh/commit/87d2f6497574bf4448641a5527a3ac2beba5fd6c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/esm-dev/esm.sh/security/advisories/GHSA-hcpf-qv9m-vfgp"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
