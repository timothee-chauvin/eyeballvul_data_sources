Priori to 2.8.1, by using mapper.getTypeFactory().constructFromCanonical(), it is possible to instruct the underlying ObjectMapper to deserialize attacker-controlled input into arbitrary classes. This enables the creation of semi-arbitrary class instances without directly invoking restricted methods or class literals. As a result, an attacker can escape the sandbox and instantiate classes such as java.net.URL, opening up the ability to access local files and URLs(e.g., file:///etc/passwd). With further chaining, this primitive can potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.8.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/hubspot/jinjava","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"079872bbf190830b8d455b19827463a0c745b9fd"}]}],"versions":["jinjava-1.0.0","jinjava-1.0.1","jinjava-1.0.2","jinjava-1.0.3","jinjava-1.0.4","jinjava-1.0.5","jinjava-1.0.6","jinjava-1.0.7","jinjava-1.0.8","jinjava-1.0.9","jinjava-2.0.0","jinjava-2.0.1","jinjava-2.0.2","jinjava-2.0.3","jinjava-2.0.4","jinjava-2.0.5","jinjava-2.5.10","jinjava-2.5.3","jinjava-2.5.4","jinjava-2.5.5","jinjava-2.5.6","jinjava-2.5.7","jinjava-2.5.8","jinjava-2.6.0","jinjava-2.7.0","jinjava-2.7.1","jinjava-2.7.2","jinjava-2.7.3","jinjava-2.7.4","jinjava-2.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59340.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/commit/66df351e7e8ad71ca04dcacb4b65782af820b8b1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/releases/tag/jinjava-2.8.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/security/advisories/GHSA-m49c-g9wr-hv6v"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1336"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
