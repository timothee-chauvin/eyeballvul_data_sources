If the buffer passed to `smtp_endofresp()` isn't NUL terminated and contains no character ending the parsed number, and `len` is set to 5, then the `strtol()` call reads beyond the allocated buffer. The read contents will not be returned to the caller.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/curl/curl","events":[{"introduced":"0966b324d911423c81351fb12e9219f71cd63be8"},{"fixed":"f3294d9d86e6a7915a967efff2842089b8b0d071"}]}],"versions":["curl-7_34_0","curl-7_35_0","curl-7_36_0","curl-7_37_0","curl-7_37_1","curl-7_38_0","curl-7_39_0","curl-7_40_0","curl-7_41_0","curl-7_42_0","curl-7_43_0","curl-7_44_0","curl-7_45_0","curl-7_46_0","curl-7_47_0","curl-7_47_1","curl-7_48_0","curl-7_49_0","curl-7_49_1","curl-7_50_0","curl-7_50_1","curl-7_50_2","curl-7_50_3","curl-7_51_0","curl-7_52_0","curl-7_52_1","curl-7_53_0","curl-7_53_1","curl-7_54_0","curl-7_54_1","curl-7_55_0","curl-7_55_1","curl-7_56_0","curl-7_56_1","curl-7_57_0","curl-7_58_0","curl-7_59_0","curl-7_60_0","curl-7_61_0","curl-7_61_1","curl-7_62_0","curl-7_63_0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-3823.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106950"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3701"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-3823"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2019-3823.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-03"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190315-0001/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3882-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4386"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2019-5072813.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-936080.pdf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/8338a0f605bdbb3a6098bb76f666a95fc2b2f53f37fa1ecc89f1146f%40%3Cdevnull.infra.apache.org%3E"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
