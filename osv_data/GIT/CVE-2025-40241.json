It is used to represent\n    special extents such as sparse extents (!EROFS_MAP_MAPPED), but\n    previously only plen == 0 was handled;\n\n  - The second one [2] has pa 0xffffffffffdcffed and plen 0xb4000,\n    then \"cur [0xfffffffffffff000] += bvec.bv_len [0x1000]\" in\n    \"} while ((cur += bvec.bv_len) < end);\" wraps around, causing an\n    out-of-bound access of pcl->compressed_bvecs[] in\n    z_erofs_submit_queue().  EROFS only supports 48-bit physical block\n    addresses (up to 1EiB for 4k blocks), so add a sanity check to\n    enforce this.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"1d191b4ca51d73699cb127386b95ac152af2b930"},{"fixed":"00d8fe0b72f4ca0a983abced36aad2160038c421"},{"fixed":"a429b76114aaca3ef1aff4cd469dcf025431bd11"}]}],"versions":["v6.14","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.18-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40241.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.15.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40241.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/00d8fe0b72f4ca0a983abced36aad2160038c421"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a429b76114aaca3ef1aff4cd469dcf025431bd11"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40241.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40241"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40241.json"}}
