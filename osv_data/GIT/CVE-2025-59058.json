Prior to version 0.0.19, the HMAC signature comparison is not timing-safe. This makes anyone who uses HS256 signature verification vulnerable to a timing attack that allows the attacker to forge a signature. Version 0.0.19 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/junkurihara/httpsig-rs","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"817e35e825e3f9f5057da0533d294624b3a8ecfe"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.10","0.0.11","0.0.12","0.0.13","0.0.14","0.0.15","0.0.16","0.0.3","0.0.4","0.0.5","0.0.6","0.0.7","0.0.8","0.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59058.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/59xxx/CVE-2025-59058.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/junkurihara/httpsig-rs/commit/fc095b6ce6043bb808f5d9c4379cf697899cb458"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/junkurihara/httpsig-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-q7pg-9pr4-mrp2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59058"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-208"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/59xxx/CVE-2025-59058.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
