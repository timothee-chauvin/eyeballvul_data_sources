Thankfully with the abuse of COW fixup, at least it won't crash\nthe kernel.\n\n[FIX]\nInstead of immediately unlocking the extent and folios, we keep the extent\nand folios locked until either erroring out or the whole delalloc range\nfinished.\n\nWhen the whole delalloc range finished without error, we just unlock the\nwhole range with PAGE_SET_ORDERED (and PAGE_UNLOCK for !keep_locked\ncases)\n---truncated---","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"8b62b72b26bcd72082c4a69d179dd906bcc22200"},{"fixed":"10b3772292bf1be45604ba83fd9650eb94382e78"},{"fixed":"692cf71173bb41395c855acbbbe197d3aedfa5d4"},{"fixed":"06f364284794f149d2abc167c11d556cf20c954b"}]}],"versions":["v2.6.31","v2.6.31-rc1","v2.6.31-rc2","v2.6.31-rc3","v2.6.31-rc4","v2.6.31-rc5","v2.6.31-rc6","v2.6.31-rc7","v2.6.31-rc8","v2.6.31-rc9","v2.6.32","v2.6.32-rc1","v2.6.32-rc2","v2.6.32-rc3","v2.6.32-rc4","v2.6.32-rc5","v2.6.32-rc6","v2.6.32-rc7","v2.6.32-rc8","v2.6.33","v2.6.33-rc1","v2.6.33-rc2","v2.6.33-rc3","v2.6.33-rc4","v2.6.33-rc5","v2.6.33-rc6","v2.6.33-rc7","v2.6.33-rc8","v2.6.34","v2.6.34-rc1","v2.6.34-rc2","v2.6.34-rc3","v2.6.34-rc4","v2.6.34-rc5","v2.6.34-rc6","v2.6.34-rc7","v2.6.35","v2.6.35-rc1","v2.6.35-rc2","v2.6.35-rc3","v2.6.35-rc4","v2.6.35-rc5","v2.6.35-rc6","v2.6.36","v2.6.36-rc1","v2.6.36-rc2","v2.6.36-rc3","v2.6.36-rc4","v2.6.36-rc5","v2.6.36-rc6","v2.6.36-rc7","v2.6.36-rc8","v2.6.37","v2.6.37-rc1","v2.6.37-rc2","v2.6.37-rc3","v2.6.37-rc4","v2.6.37-rc5","v2.6.37-rc6","v2.6.37-rc7","v2.6.37-rc8","v2.6.38","v2.6.38-rc1","v2.6.38-rc2","v2.6.38-rc3","v2.6.38-rc4","v2.6.38-rc5","v2.6.38-rc6","v2.6.38-rc7","v2.6.38-rc8","v2.6.39","v2.6.39-rc1","v2.6.39-rc2","v2.6.39-rc3","v2.6.39-rc4","v2.6.39-rc5","v2.6.39-rc6","v2.6.39-rc7","v3.0","v3.0-rc1","v3.0-rc2","v3.0-rc3","v3.0-rc4","v3.0-rc5","v3.0-rc6","v3.0-rc7","v3.1","v3.1-rc1","v3.1-rc10","v3.1-rc2","v3.1-rc3","v3.1-rc4","v3.1-rc5","v3.1-rc6","v3.1-rc7","v3.1-rc8","v3.1-rc9","v3.10","v3.10-rc1","v3.10-rc2","v3.10-rc3","v3.10-rc4","v3.10-rc5","v3.10-rc6","v3.10-rc7","v3.11","v3.11-rc1","v3.11-rc2","v3.11-rc3","v3.11-rc4","v3.11-rc5","v3.11-rc6","v3.11-rc7","v3.12","v3.12-rc1","v3.12-rc2","v3.12-rc3","v3.12-rc4","v3.12-rc5","v3.12-rc6","v3.12-rc7","v3.13","v3.13-rc1","v3.13-rc2","v3.13-rc3","v3.13-rc4","v3.13-rc5","v3.13-rc6","v3.13-rc7","v3.13-rc8","v3.14","v3.14-rc1","v3.14-rc2","v3.14-rc3","v3.14-rc4","v3.14-rc5","v3.14-rc6","v3.14-rc7","v3.14-rc8","v3.15","v3.15-rc1","v3.15-rc2","v3.15-rc3","v3.15-rc4","v3.15-rc5","v3.15-rc6","v3.15-rc7","v3.15-rc8","v3.16","v3.16-rc1","v3.16-rc2","v3.16-rc3","v3.16-rc4","v3.16-rc5","v3.16-rc6","v3.16-rc7","v3.17","v3.17-rc1","v3.17-rc2","v3.17-rc3","v3.17-rc4","v3.17-rc5","v3.17-rc6","v3.17-rc7","v3.18","v3.18-rc1","v3.18-rc2","v3.18-rc3","v3.18-rc4","v3.18-rc5","v3.18-rc6","v3.18-rc7","v3.19","v3.19-rc1","v3.19-rc2","v3.19-rc3","v3.19-rc4","v3.19-rc5","v3.19-rc6","v3.19-rc7","v3.2","v3.2-rc1","v3.2-rc2","v3.2-rc3","v3.2-rc4","v3.2-rc5","v3.2-rc6","v3.2-rc7","v3.3","v3.3-rc1","v3.3-rc2","v3.3-rc3","v3.3-rc4","v3.3-rc5","v3.3-rc6","v3.3-rc7","v3.4","v3.4-rc1","v3.4-rc2","v3.4-rc3","v3.4-rc4","v3.4-rc5","v3.4-rc6","v3.4-rc7","v3.5","v3.5-rc1","v3.5-rc2","v3.5-rc3","v3.5-rc4","v3.5-rc5","v3.5-rc6","v3.5-rc7","v3.6","v3.6-rc1","v3.6-rc2","v3.6-rc3","v3.6-rc4","v3.6-rc5","v3.6-rc6","v3.6-rc7","v3.7","v3.7-rc1","v3.7-rc2","v3.7-rc3","v3.7-rc4","v3.7-rc5","v3.7-rc6","v3.7-rc7","v3.7-rc8","v3.8","v3.8-rc1","v3.8-rc2","v3.8-rc3","v3.8-rc4","v3.8-rc5","v3.8-rc6","v3.8-rc7","v3.9","v3.9-rc1","v3.9-rc2","v3.9-rc3","v3.9-rc4","v3.9-rc5","v3.9-rc6","v3.9-rc7","v3.9-rc8","v4.0","v4.0-rc1","v4.0-rc2","v4.0-rc3","v4.0-rc4","v4.0-rc5","v4.0-rc6","v4.0-rc7","v4.1","v4.1-rc1","v4.1-rc2","v4.1-rc3","v4.1-rc4","v4.1-rc5","v4.1-rc6","v4.1-rc7","v4.1-rc8","v4.10","v4.10-rc1","v4.10-rc2","v4.10-rc3","v4.10-rc4","v4.10-rc5","v4.10-rc6","v4.10-rc7","v4.10-rc8","v4.11","v4.11-rc1","v4.11-rc2","v4.11-rc3","v4.11-rc4","v4.11-rc5","v4.11-rc6","v4.11-rc7","v4.11-rc8","v4.12","v4.12-rc1","v4.12-rc2","v4.12-rc3","v4.12-rc4","v4.12-rc5","v4.12-rc6","v4.12-rc7","v4.13","v4.13-rc1","v4.13-rc2","v4.13-rc3","v4.13-rc4","v4.13-rc5","v4.13-rc6","v4.13-rc7","v4.14","v4.14-rc1","v4.14-rc2","v4.14-rc3","v4.14-rc4","v4.14-rc5","v4.14-rc6","v4.14-rc7","v4.14-rc8","v4.15","v4.15-rc1","v4.15-rc2","v4.15-rc3","v4.15-rc4","v4.15-rc5","v4.15-rc6","v4.15-rc7","v4.15-rc8","v4.15-rc9","v4.16","v4.16-rc1","v4.16-rc2","v4.16-rc3","v4.16-rc4","v4.16-rc5","v4.16-rc6","v4.16-rc7","v4.17","v4.17-rc1","v4.17-rc2","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.2","v4.2-rc1","v4.2-rc2","v4.2-rc3","v4.2-rc4","v4.2-rc5","v4.2-rc6","v4.2-rc7","v4.2-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v4.3","v4.3-rc1","v4.3-rc2","v4.3-rc3","v4.3-rc4","v4.3-rc5","v4.3-rc6","v4.3-rc7","v4.4","v4.4-rc1","v4.4-rc2","v4.4-rc3","v4.4-rc4","v4.4-rc5","v4.4-rc6","v4.4-rc7","v4.4-rc8","v4.5","v4.5-rc1","v4.5-rc2","v4.5-rc3","v4.5-rc4","v4.5-rc5","v4.5-rc6","v4.5-rc7","v4.6","v4.6-rc1","v4.6-rc2","v4.6-rc3","v4.6-rc4","v4.6-rc5","v4.6
