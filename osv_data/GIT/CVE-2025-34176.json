This value is directly used in a file existence check operation. While the contents of the file cannot be read, the server reveals whether the file exists, which enables an attacker to enumerate files on the target. The attacker must be authenticated with at least \"WebCfg - Services: suricata package\" permissions.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pfsense/freebsd-ports","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"97852ccfd201b24ee542be30af81272485fde0b4"}]}],"versions":["END-OF-2015Q4","devel_before_hashes_changed"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-34176.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/netgate-pf-sense-ce-suricata-directory-traversal-information-disclosure"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pfsense/FreeBSD-ports/commit/97852ccfd201b24ee542be30af81272485fde0b4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/16414"}]}
