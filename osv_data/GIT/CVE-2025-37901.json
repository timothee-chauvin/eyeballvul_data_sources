Those GPIOs do not\nhave a corresponding MPM pin and should not be handled inside the MPM\ndriver. The IRQ domain hierarchy is always applied, so it's required to\nexplicitly disconnect the hierarchy for those. The pinctrl-msm driver marks\nthese with GPIO_NO_WAKE_IRQ. qcom-pdc has a check for this, but\nirq-qcom-mpm is currently missing the check. This is causing crashes when\nsetting up interrupts for non-wake GPIOs:\n\n root@rb1:~# gpiomon -c gpiochip1 10\n   irq: IRQ159: trimming hierarchy from :soc@0:interrupt-controller@f200000-1\n   Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff8000a1dc3820\n   Hardware name: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
