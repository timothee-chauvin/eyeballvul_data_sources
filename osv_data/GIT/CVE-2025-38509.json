{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-38509","published":"2025-08-16T10:54:46.493Z","modified":"2025-12-05T09:40:10.431930Z","summary":"wifi: mac80211: reject VHT opmode for unsupported channel widths","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: reject VHT opmode for unsupported channel widths\n\nVHT operating mode notifications are not defined for channel widths\nbelow 20 MHz. In particular, 5 MHz and 10 MHz are not valid under the\nVHT specification and must be rejected.\n\nWithout this check, malformed notifications using these widths may\nreach ieee80211_chan_width_to_rx_bw(), leading to a WARN_ON due to\ninvalid input. This issue was reported by syzbot.\n\nReject these unsupported widths early in sta_link_apply_parameters()\nwhen opmode_notif is used. The accepted set includes 20, 40, 80, 160,\nand 80+80 MHz, which are valid for VHT. While 320 MHz is not defined\nfor VHT, it is allowed to avoid rejecting HE or EHT clients that may\nstill send a VHT opmode notification.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"751e7489c1d74b94ffffbed619d8fd724eeff4ee"},{"fixed":"18eca59a04500b68a90e0c5c873f97c9d1ea2bfa"},{"fixed":"58fcb1b4287ce38850402bb2bb16d09bf77b91d9"}]}],"versions":["v6.12","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.15.1","v6.15.2","v6.15.3","v6.15.4","v6.15.5","v6.15.6","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38509.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.15.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38509.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/18eca59a04500b68a90e0c5c873f97c9d1ea2bfa"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/58fcb1b4287ce38850402bb2bb16d09bf77b91d9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/38xxx/CVE-2025-38509.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38509"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/38xxx/CVE-2025-38509.json"}}
