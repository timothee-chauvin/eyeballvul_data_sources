{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68158","published":"2026-01-08T17:58:17.724Z","modified":"2026-01-08T19:40:32.774948Z","summary":"Authlib: 1-click Account Takeover","details":"Authlib is a Python library which builds OAuth and OpenID Connect servers. In version 1.6.5 and prior, cache-backed state/request-token storage is not tied to the initiating user session, so CSRF is possible for any attacker that has a valid state (easily obtainable via an attacker-initiated authentication flow). When a cache is supplied to the OAuth client registry, FrameworkIntegration.set_state_data writes the entire state blob under _state_{app}_{state}, and get_state_data ignores the caller’s session altogether. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/authlib/authlib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bb7a315befbad333faf9a23ef574d6e3134a6774"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.6"}]}}],"versions":["v0.1","v0.10","v0.11","v0.12","v0.13","v0.14","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.15","v0.15.1","v0.2","v0.2.1","v0.3","v0.4","v0.4.1","v0.5","v0.5.1","v0.6","v0.7","v0.8","v0.9","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68158.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68158.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/authlib/authlib/commit/2808378611dd6fb2532b189a9087877d8f0c0489"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/authlib/authlib/commit/7974f45e4d7492ab5f527577677f2770ce423228"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/authlib/authlib/security/advisories/GHSA-fg6f-75jq-6523"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68158"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-352"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68158.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
