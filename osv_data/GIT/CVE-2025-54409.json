{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-54409","published":"2025-08-14T15:52:24.069Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:19:54.490321Z","aliases":["GHSA-79g7-f8rv-jcxh"],"related":["MGASA-2025-0224"],"summary":"AIDE null pointer dereference when reading incorrectly encoded xattr attributes from database (local DoS)","details":"AIDE is an advanced intrusion detection environment. From versions 0.13 to 0.19.1, there is a null pointer dereference vulnerability in AIDE. An attacker can crash the program during report printing or database listing after setting extended file attributes with an empty attribute value or with a key containing a comma. A local user might exploit this to cause a local denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 0.19.2. A workaround involves removing xattrs group from rules matching files on affected file systems.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/aide/aide","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"09bfeb7f91dacd9834f458f5712dfeac2606fc85"},{"fixed":"54a6d0d9d5f14b81961d66373c0291bf4af4135a"}]}],"versions":["aide.0.10.release","aide.0.11.rc1.release","aide.0.11.rc2.release","aide.0.11.rc3.release","aide.0.11.release","aide.0.11a.debian","aide.0.11b.nocurl","aide.0.12.rc1.release","aide.0.12.rc2.release","aide.0.12.release","aide.0.13.1.release","aide.0.13.rc1.release","aide.0.13.rc2.release","aide.0.13.release","aide.0.14.1.release","aide.0.14.2.release","aide.0.14.rc1.release","aide.0.14.rc2.release","aide.0.14.rc3.release","aide.0.14.release","aide.0.15.1.release","aide.0.15.rc1.release","aide.0.15.release","cs.tut.fi.import","v0.16","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.16a1","v0.16a2","v0.16b1","v0.16rc1","v0.17","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.17.3","v0.18","v0.19","v0.19.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54409.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"139957638231509996529344293125411944926","length":597},"id":"CVE-2025-54409-063f70e3","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/aide/aide/commit/54a6d0d9d5f14b81961d66373c0291bf4af4135a","target":{"file":"src/db_file.c","function":"str_xattr"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["240633656327470416087605333886147545107","222532754395668194269031825964900562400","99177587292487885968028833533206935792","67638161372897658726778897554014937801"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2025-54409-0d77ac33","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/aide/aide/commit/54a6d0d9d5f14b81961d66373c0291bf4af4135a","target":{"file":"src/db_file.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"334746699140210284191954817973846700488","length":5275},"id":"CVE-2025-54409-1284eacd","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/aide/aide/commit/54a6d0d9d5f14b81961d66373c0291bf4af4135a","target":{"file":"src/db.c","function":"db_char2line"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["118297189687823352206657114831738145911","80277695535089239552610719086309280993","9520165563721108839015907472576524260","233545489577789070350457659198852240444","236718370463409669901992631373774490209","230224585779926504478593569389342944878","302374927479932083730091917067714381459","310035386697265496613305999705883865383","229728355393457239767922114854516406444","161099081258952239597598758032348639520","220630822962340560947005124271742234211","136705913406198808329408834090435255767","47663340844430266454309999591453196185"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2025-54409-1fbc0f1e","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/aide/aide/commit/54a6d0d9d5f14b81961d66373c0291bf4af4135a","target":{"file":"src/db.c"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/08/14/8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54409.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/aide/aide/commit/54a6d0d9d5f14b81961d66373c0291bf4af4135a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/aide/aide/releases/tag/v0.19.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/aide/aide/security/advisories/GHSA-79g7-f8rv-jcxh"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/08/msg00011.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54409"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-476"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54409.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
