when MODE=Bare\nis selected,software must write zero to the remaining fields of hgatp.\n\nWe have detected the valid mode supported by the HW before, So using a\nvalid mode to detect how many vmid bits are supported.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"fd7bb4a251dfc1da3496bf59a4793937c13e8c1f"},{"fixed":"d00b61cd37f4c183ce0edbc9f8ccf6d5430ea357"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"fd7bb4a251dfc1da3496bf59a4793937c13e8c1f"},{"fixed":"2b351e3d04be9e1533f26c3464f1e44a5beace30"}]}],"versions":["v5.15","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40065.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["243071784373728893547724292080401137715","171695944463630887686087566632869066200","124986319343225704371822865136873409990","92652289191922572875702333028510226491","36067299168283784053741751115436072889","159775589630410139753387814389787547479","257317366934873502016165612450458594864","224198234103558933013484663686893809180"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2025-40065-08e4bc30","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git@2b351e3d04be9e1533f26c3464f1e44a5beace30","target":{"file":"arch/riscv/kvm/vmid.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"88660808286457977521297660770126343955","length":364},"id":"CVE-2025-40065-b674eb79","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git@d00b61cd37f4c183ce0edbc9f8ccf6d5430ea357","target":{"file":"arch/riscv/kvm/vmid.c","function":"kvm_riscv_gstage_vmid_detect"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["243071784373728893547724292080401137715","171695944463630887686087566632869066200","124986319343225704371822865136873409990","92652289191922572875702333028510226491","36067299168283784053741751115436072889","159775589630410139753387814389787547479","257317366934873502016165612450458594864","224198234103558933013484663686893809180"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2025-40065-ecb346db","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git@d00b61cd37f4c183ce0edbc9f8ccf6d5430ea357","target":{"file":"arch/riscv/kvm/vmid.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"88660808286457977521297660770126343955","length":364},"id":"CVE-2025-40065-eea7766f","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git@2b351e3d04be9e1533f26c3464f1e44a5beace30","target":{"file":"arch/riscv/kvm/vmid.c","function":"kvm_riscv_gstage_vmid_detect"}}]}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40065.js
