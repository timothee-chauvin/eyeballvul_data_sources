This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/npm/node-tar","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3e35515c09da615ac268254bed85fe43ee71e2f0"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.10","0.1.11","0.1.12","0.1.13","0.1.2","0.1.3","0.1.5","0.1.6","0.1.7","0.1.8","0.1.9","v0.1.14","v0.1.15","v0.1.16","v0.1.17","v0.1.18","v0.1.19","v0.1.20","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.10","v3.1.11","v3.1.12","v3.1.13","v3.1.14","v3.1.15","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.1.4","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.1.9","v3.2.0","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.2.0","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.4.10","v4.4.11","v4.4.12","v4.4.13","v4.4.14","v4.4.15","v4.4.16","v4.4.17","v4.4.2","v4.4.3","v4.4.4","v4.4.5","v4.4.6","v4.4.7","v4.4.8","v4.4.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-37713.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-5955-9wpr-37jh"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
