To skip this check, the connection had to be done with QUIC\nwith ngtcp2 built to use GnuTLS and the user had to explicitly disable the\nstandard certificate verification.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"8.8.0"},{"fixed":"8.18.0"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git","events":[{"introduced":"3210101088dfa3d6a125d213226b092f2f866722"},{"fixed":"3d91ca8cdb3b434226e743946d428b4dd3acf2c9"}]}],"versions":["8.17.0","8.16.0","8.15.0","8.14.1","8.14.0","8.13.0","8.12.1","8.12.0","8.11.1","8.11.0","8.10.1","8.10.0","8.9.1","8.9.0","8.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://curl.se/docs/CURL-CVE-2025-13034.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["179428586170313273926297589203595614773","50410129086084055542981604961884526649","229285328376556365516419558986911544574","290211129843678487728733807699954415981","85966206325908396785535920920966795191","256107137115537267719741446232912209871","274571685078768113572757999914112884789","152929441713491423709269128526208759794","14007745848759525254627443170726810812","243907996199602420186187158036089872846"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CURL-CVE-2025-13034-9519d576","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git/commit/3d91ca8cdb3b434226e743946d428b4dd3acf2c9","target":{"file":"lib/vquic/vquic-tls.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"133740698772490697791508953444701241693","length":1242},"id":"CURL-CVE-2025-13034-c5db70af","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git/commit/3d91ca8cdb3b434226e743946d428b4dd3acf2c9","target":{"file":"lib/vquic/vquic-tls.c","function":"Curl_vquic_tls_verify_peer"}}]}}],"database_specific":{"CWE":{"desc":"Improper Certificate Validation","id":"CWE-295"},"URL":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2025-13034.json","affects":"both","award":{"amount":"2540","currency":"USD"},"last_affected":"8.17.0","package":"curl","severity":"Medium","www":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2025-13034.html"},"credits":[{"name":"Stanislav Fort (Aisle Research)","type":"FINDER"},{"name":"Daniel Stenberg","type":"REMEDIATION_DEVELOPER"}]}
