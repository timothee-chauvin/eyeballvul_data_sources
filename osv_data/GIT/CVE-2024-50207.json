This operation may be invoked concurrently with readers that\nrely on some of the modified data, such as the head bit (RB_PAGE_HEAD), or\nthe ring_buffer_per_cpu.pages and reader_page pointers. However, no\nexclusive access is acquired by ring_buffer_subbuf_order_set(). Modifying\nthe mentioned data while a reader also operates on them can then result in\nincorrect memory access and various crashes.\n\nFix the problem by taking the reader_lock when updating a specific\nring_buffer_per_cpu in ring_buffer_subbuf_order_set().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"8e7b58c27b3c567316a51079b375b846f9223bba"},{"fixed":"a569290525a05162d5dd26d9845591eaf46e5802"},{"fixed":"09661f75e75cb6c1d2d8326a70c311d46729235f"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.11.1","v6.11.2","v6.11.3","v6.11.4","v6.11.5","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.7","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-50207.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.11.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-50207.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/09661f75e75cb6c1d2d8326a70c311d46729235f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a569290525a05162d5dd26d9845591eaf46e5802"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/50xxx/CVE-2024-50207.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50207"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/50xxx/CVE-2024-50207.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
