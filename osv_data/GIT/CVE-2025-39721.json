{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-39721","published":"2025-09-05T17:21:28Z","modified":"2025-10-22T16:01:18.608659Z","related":["MGASA-2025-0234","MGASA-2025-0235"],"summary":"crypto: qat - flush misc workqueue during device shutdown","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: qat - flush misc workqueue during device shutdown\n\nRepeated loading and unloading of a device specific QAT driver, for\nexample qat_4xxx, in a tight loop can lead to a crash due to a\nuse-after-free scenario. This occurs when a power management (PM)\ninterrupt triggers just before the device-specific driver (e.g.,\nqat_4xxx.ko) is unloaded, while the core driver (intel_qat.ko) remains\nloaded.\n\nSince the driver uses a shared workqueue (`qat_misc_wq`) across all\ndevices and owned by intel_qat.ko, a deferred routine from the\ndevice-specific driver may still be pending in the queue. If this\nroutine executes after the driver is unloaded, it can dereference freed\nmemory, resulting in a page fault and kernel crash like the following:\n\n    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffa000002e50a01c\n    #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n    RIP: 0010:pm_bh_handler+0x1d2/0x250 [intel_qat]\n    Call Trace:\n      pm_bh_handler+0x1d2/0x250 [intel_qat]\n      process_one_work+0x171/0x340\n      worker_thread+0x277/0x3a0\n      kthread+0xf0/0x120\n      ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n\nTo prevent this, flush the misc workqueue during device shutdown to\nensure that all pending work items are completed before the driver is\nunloaded.\n\nNote: This approach may slightly increase shutdown latency if the\nworkqueue contains jobs from other devices, but it ensures correctness\nand stability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"e5745f34113b758b45d134dec04a7df94dc67131"},{"fixed":"5858448a6c65d8ee3f8600570d3ce19febcb33be"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"e5745f34113b758b45d134dec04a7df94dc67131"},{"fixed":"fe546f5c50fc474daca6bee72caa7ab68a74c33d"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"e5745f34113b758b45d134dec04a7df94dc67131"},{"fixed":"e59a52e429e13df3feb34f4853a8e36d121ed937"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"e5745f34113b758b45d134dec04a7df94dc67131"},{"fixed":"3d4df408ba9bad2b205c7fb8afc1836a6a4ca88a"}]}],"versions":["v5.17","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.16.1","v6.16.2","v6.16.3","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.100","v6.6.101","v6.6.102","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.5","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.59","v6.6.6","v6.6.60","v6.6.61","v6.6.62","v6.6.63","v6.6.64","v6.6.65","v6.6.66","v6.6.67","v6.6.68","v6.6.69","v6.6.7","v6.6.70","v6.6.71","v6.6.72","v6.6.73","v6.6.74","v6.6.75","v6.6.76","v6.6.77","v6.6.78","v6.6.79","v6.6.8","v6.6.80","v6.6.81","v6.6.82","v6.6.83","v6.6.84","v6.6.85","v6.6.86","v6.6.87","v6.6.88","v6.6.89","v6.6.9","v6.6.90","v6.6.91","v6.6.92","v6.6.93","v6.6.94","v6.6.95","v6.6.96","v6.6.97","v6.6.98","v6.6.99","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39721.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["300463152734477861155469999509099524007","288796331039966203176762158159452029368","61778264227304562568730194550342934459","250114694481440085943839759425920137893"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2025-39721-02506325","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git@fe546f5c50fc474daca6bee72caa7ab68a74c33d","target":{"file":"drivers/crypto/intel/qat/qat_common/adf_common_drv.h"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"185721370723068638891904519569013585213","length":1502},"id":"CVE-2025-39721-0cc53e19","signature_type":"Function
