Users that get site admin but not a system admin, should not have access to the System Maintenance → Tools portlet. This would share database username and password under Log Files and download DB Dump and other dotCMS Content under Tools. Nothing in the System → Maintenance should be displayed for users with site admin role. Only system admins must have access to System Maintenance.\n\nOWASP Top 10 - A01) Broken Access Control\n\nOWASP Top 10 - A04) Insecure Design","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dotcms/core","events":[{"introduced":"a7dc7c4140d33d98ccc65120f9d659d07ad42ce0"},{"fixed":"cc51d80d4145ee517c981a5e9b7b5399ca3dfca3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-3164.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/27909"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/dotCMS/core/pull/27912"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.dotcms.com/security/SI-69"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
