{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-65107","published":"2025-11-21T21:49:18.988Z","modified":"2025-11-27T13:19:44.023957Z","aliases":["GHSA-w9pw-c549-5m6w"],"summary":"Langfuse SSO Account Takeover via CSRF or phishing attack","details":"Langfuse is an open source large language model engineering platform. In versions from 2.95.0 to before 2.95.12 and from 3.17.0 to before 3.131.0, in SSO provider configurations without an explicit AUTH_<PROVIDER>_CHECK setting, a potential account takeover may happen if an authenticated user is made to call a specifically crafted URL via a CSRF or phishing attack. This issue has been patched in versions 2.95.12 and 3.131.0. A workaround for this issue involves setting AUTH_<PROVIDER>_CHECK.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse","events":[{"introduced":"22f6a02b08c11eda6a07077f1abd90c991df64f3"},{"fixed":"565ff73591365394a24e047973c15e69d6ffca93"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.95.0"},{"fixed":"2.95.12"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse","events":[{"introduced":"d54cbc6c9ba3f04223d8ece22862c6a1e677f101"},{"fixed":"f80c86c75b3bc0bc465d9d3a27328d10a5246c14"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.17.0"},{"fixed":"3.131.0"}]}}],"versions":["v3.100.0","v3.101.0","v3.102.0","v3.103.0","v3.104.0","v3.105.0","v3.106.0","v3.106.1","v3.106.2","v3.106.3","v3.106.4","v3.107.0","v3.108.0","v3.109.0","v3.110.0","v3.111.0","v3.112.0","v3.113.0","v3.114.0","v3.115.0","v3.116.0","v3.116.1","v3.117.0","v3.117.1","v3.117.2","v3.118.0","v3.119.0","v3.119.1","v3.120.0","v3.121.0","v3.122.0","v3.122.1","v3.122.2","v3.123.0","v3.123.1","v3.124.0","v3.124.1","v3.125.0","v3.126.0","v3.126.1","v3.127.0","v3.128.0","v3.129.0","v3.130.0","v3.17.0","v3.17.1","v3.18.0","v3.19.0","v3.20.0","v3.21.0","v3.22.0","v3.23.0","v3.24.0","v3.24.1","v3.25.0","v3.26.0","v3.27.0","v3.27.1","v3.27.2","v3.28.0","v3.28.1","v3.28.3","v3.29.0","v3.29.1","v3.30.0","v3.31.0","v3.32.0","v3.32.1","v3.33.0","v3.33.1","v3.34.0","v3.34.1","v3.35.0","v3.35.1","v3.36.0","v3.37.0","v3.38.0","v3.39.0","v3.40.0","v3.41.0","v3.41.1","v3.42.0","v3.42.1","v3.43.0","v3.44.0","v3.45.0","v3.45.1","v3.45.2","v3.46.0","v3.47.0","v3.48.0","v3.48.1","v3.49.0","v3.49.1","v3.50.0","v3.51.0","v3.51.1","v3.51.2","v3.52.0","v3.53.0","v3.54.0","v3.54.1","v3.55.0","v3.56.0","v3.57.0","v3.57.1","v3.57.2","v3.58.0","v3.59.0","v3.59.1","v3.60.0","v3.60.1","v3.61.0","v3.62.0","v3.62.1","v3.63.0","v3.63.1","v3.64.0","v3.65.0","v3.65.1","v3.65.2","v3.65.3","v3.66.0","v3.66.1","v3.67.0","v3.68.0","v3.69.0","v3.70.0","v3.71.0","v3.72.0","v3.72.1","v3.73.0","v3.73.1","v3.74.0","v3.75.0","v3.75.1","v3.75.2","v3.75.3","v3.75.4","v3.76.0","v3.77.0","v3.78.0","v3.78.1","v3.78.2","v3.79.0","v3.79.1","v3.80.0","v3.80.1","v3.81.0","v3.81.1","v3.82.0","v3.83.0","v3.84.0","v3.85.0","v3.85.1","v3.85.2","v3.86.0","v3.86.1","v3.87.0","v3.87.1","v3.88.0","v3.88.1","v3.89.0","v3.90.0","v3.91.0","v3.92.0","v3.92.1","v3.93.0","v3.94.0","v3.95.0","v3.95.1","v3.95.2","v3.96.0","v3.96.1","v3.96.2","v3.97.0","v3.97.1","v3.97.2","v3.97.3","v3.97.4","v3.97.5","v3.98.0","v3.98.1","v3.98.2","v3.99.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65107.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/security/advisories/GHSA-w9pw-c549-5m6w"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-285","CWE-352"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
