Starting in version 1.14.0 and prior to versions 1.14.8 and 1.15.2, In Cilium clusters with WireGuard enabled and traffic matching Layer 7 policies Wireguard-eligible traffic that is sent between a node's Envoy proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted and Wireguard-eligible traffic that is sent between a node's DNS proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted. This issue has been resolved in Cilium 1.14.8 and 1.15.2 in in native routing mode (`routingMode=native`) and in Cilium 1.14.4 in tunneling mode (`routingMode=tunnel`). Not that in tunneling mode, `encryption.wireguard.encapsulate` must be set to `true`. There is no known workaround for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium","events":[{"introduced":"b5013e1562dbfe442dd2011a5af46de9095315ff"},{"fixed":"cf6e022edbedc39c35237330ab85c158ff17f207"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.14.0"},{"fixed":"1.14.8"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium","events":[{"introduced":"2db45c468981a863b230186ad37d44e5a7c08d61"},{"fixed":"7cf5782920423b07e7a4e6e67fafd81e1d4a1d33"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.15.0"},{"fixed":"1.15.2"}]}}],"versions":["1.14.0","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.14.5","1.14.6","1.14.7","1.15.0","1.15.1","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.14.2","v1.14.3","v1.14.4","v1.14.5","v1.14.6","v1.14.7","v1.15.0","v1.15.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-28250.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.13.13"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.14.8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.15.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-v6q2-4qr3-5cw6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-311"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
