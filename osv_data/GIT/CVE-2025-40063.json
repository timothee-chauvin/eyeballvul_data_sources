{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-40063","published":"2025-10-28T11:48:34.549Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:14:41.520104Z","summary":"crypto: comp - Use same definition of context alloc and free ops","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: comp - Use same definition of context alloc and free ops\n\nIn commit 42d9f6c77479 (\"crypto: acomp - Move scomp stream allocation\ncode into acomp\"), the crypto_acomp_streams struct was made to rely on\nhaving the alloc_ctx and free_ctx operations defined in the same order\nas the scomp_alg struct. But in that same commit, the alloc_ctx and\nfree_ctx members of scomp_alg may be randomized by structure layout\nrandomization, since they are contained in a pure ops structure\n(containing only function pointers). If the pointers within scomp_alg\nare randomized, but those in crypto_acomp_streams are not, then\nthe order may no longer match. This fixes the problem by removing the\nunion from scomp_alg so that both crypto_acomp_streams and scomp_alg\nwill share the same definition of alloc_ctx and free_ctx, ensuring\nthey will always have the same layout.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"42d9f6c774790d290c175e8775ce9f1366438098"},{"fixed":"779d3b6f2d32c5f1da6163e959abe1e1ffe2945b"},{"fixed":"f75f66683ded09f7135aef2e763c245a07c8271a"}]}],"versions":["v6.15","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40063.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40063.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/779d3b6f2d32c5f1da6163e959abe1e1ffe2945b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f75f66683ded09f7135aef2e763c245a07c8271a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40063.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40063"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40063.json"}}
