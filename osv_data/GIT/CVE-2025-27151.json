In versions starting from 7.0.0 to before 8.0.2, a stack-based buffer overflow exists in redis-check-aof due to the use of memcpy with strlen(filepath) when copying a user-supplied file path into a fixed-size stack buffer. This allows an attacker to overflow the stack and potentially achieve code execution. This issue has been patched in version 8.0.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/redis/redis","events":[{"introduced":"d375595d5e3ae2e5c29e6c00a2dc3d60578fd9fc"},{"fixed":"994bc96bb1744cb153392fc96bdba43eae56e17f"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27151.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-5453-q98w-cmvm"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/643b5db235cb82508e72f11c7b4bbfc7dc39be56"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/8.0.2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-121","CWE-20"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
