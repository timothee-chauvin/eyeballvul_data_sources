hrtimer to expire in hard interrupt context","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nLoongArch: KVM: Mark hrtimer to expire in hard interrupt context\n\nLike commit 2c0d278f3293f (\"KVM: LAPIC: Mark hrtimer to expire in hard\ninterrupt context\") and commit 9090825fa9974 (\"KVM: arm/arm64: Let the\ntimer expire in hardirq context on RT\"), On PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels\nunmarked hrtimers are moved into soft interrupt expiry mode by default.\nThen the timers are canceled from an preempt-notifier which is invoked\nwith disabled preemption which is not allowed on PREEMPT_RT.\n\nThe timer callback is short so in could be invoked in hard-IRQ context.\nSo let the timer expire on hard-IRQ context even on -RT.\n\nThis fix a \"scheduling while atomic\" bug for PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels:\n\n BUG: scheduling while atomic: qemu-system-loo/1011/0x00000002\n Modules linked in: amdgpu rfkill nft_fib_inet nft_fib_ipv4 nft_fib_ipv6 nft_fib nft_reject_inet
