As a result, a malicious plugin author could use characters in a plugin name that would result in unexpected behavior, such as duplicating the name of another plugin or spoofing the output to `helm --help`. This issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2. A possible workaround is to not install untrusted Helm plugins. Examine the `name` field in the `plugin.yaml` file for a plugin, looking for characters outside of the [a-zA-Z0-9._-] range.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/helm/helm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"809e2d999e2c33e20e77f6bff30652d79c287542"}]}],"versions":["1.999.0","v1.0","v1.1","v1.2","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha.1","v2.0.0-alpha.2","v2.0.0-alpha.4","v2.0.0-alpha.5","v2.0.0-beta.1","v2.0.0-beta.2","v2.0.0-rc.1","v2.0.0-rc.2","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.7.0-rc1","v2.8.0-rc.1","v3.0.0-alpha.1","v3.0.0-alpha.2","v3.0.0-beta.1","v3.0.0-beta.2","v3.0.0-beta.3","v3.0.0-beta.4","v3.0.0-beta.5","v3.1.0-rc.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-15186.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/809e2d999e2c33e20e77f6bff30652d79c287542"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-m54r-vrmv-hw33"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
