{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-21709","published":"2025-02-27T02:07:22.452Z","modified":"2025-12-05T08:30:14.371450Z","summary":"kernel: be more careful about dup_mmap() failures and uprobe registering","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkernel: be more careful about dup_mmap() failures and uprobe registering\n\nIf a memory allocation fails during dup_mmap(), the maple tree can be left\nin an unsafe state for other iterators besides the exit path.  All the\nlocks are dropped before the exit_mmap() call (in mm/mmap.c), but the\nincomplete mm_struct can be reached through (at least) the rmap finding\nthe vmas which have a pointer back to the mm_struct.\n\nUp to this point, there have been no issues with being able to find an\nmm_struct that was only partially initialised.  Syzbot was able to make\nthe incomplete mm_struct fail with recent forking changes, so it has been\nproven unsafe to use the mm_struct that hasn't been initialised, as\nreferenced in the link below.\n\nAlthough 8ac662f5da19f (\"fork: avoid inappropriate uprobe access to\ninvalid mm\") fixed the uprobe access, it does not completely remove the\nrace.\n\nThis patch sets the MMF_OOM_SKIP to avoid the iteration of the vmas on the\noom side (even though this is extremely unlikely to be selected as an oom\nvictim in the race window), and sets MMF_UNSTABLE to avoid other potential\nusers from using a partially initialised mm_struct.\n\nWhen registering vmas for uprobe, skip the vmas in an mm that is marked\nunstable.  Modifying a vma in an unstable mm may cause issues if the mm\nisn't fully initialised.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d2406291483775ecddaee929231a39c70c08fda2"},{"fixed":"da139948aeda677ac09cc0e7d837f8a314de7d55"},{"fixed":"64c37e134b120fb462fb4a80694bfb8e7be77b14"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.13.1","v6.7","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21709.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.13.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21709.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/64c37e134b120fb462fb4a80694bfb8e7be77b14"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/da139948aeda677ac09cc0e7d837f8a314de7d55"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/21xxx/CVE-2025-21709.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21709"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/21xxx/CVE-2025-21709.json"}}
