Nevertheless, it's clear that this\nplumbing has seen limited testing, since userspace can trivially cause a\nWARN in the MMIO return:\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 30558 at arch/arm64/include/asm/kvm_emulate.h:536 kvm_handle_mmio_return+0x46c/0x5c4 arch/arm64/include/asm/kvm_emulate.h:536\n  Call trace:\n   kvm_handle_mmio_return+0x46c/0x5c4 arch/arm64/include/asm/kvm_emulate.h:536\n   kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x98/0x15b4 arch/arm64/kvm/arm.c:1133\n   kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x75c/0xa78 virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:4487\n   __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n   __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:893 [inline]\n   __arm64_sys_ioctl+0x14c/0x1c8 fs/ioctl.c:893\n   __invoke_syscall arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:35 [inline]\n   invoke_syscall+0x98/0x2b8 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:49\n   el0_svc_common+0x1e0/0x23c arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:132\n   do_el0_svc+0x48/0x58 arch/arm64/kernel/syscall.c:151\n   el0_svc+0x38/0x68 arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:712\n   el0t_64_sync_handler+0x90/0xfc arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:730\n   el0t_64_sync+0x190/0x194 arch/arm64/kernel/entry.S:598\n\nThe splat is complaining that KVM is advancing PC while an exception is\npending, i.e. that KVM is retiring the MMIO instruction despite a\npending synchronous external abort. Womp womp.\n\nFix the glaring UAPI bug by skipping over all the MMIO emulation in\ncase there is a pending synchronous exception. Note that while userspace\nis capable of pending an asynchronous exception (SError, IRQ, or FIQ),\nit is still safe to retire the MMIO instruction in this case as (1) they\nare by definition asynchronous, and (2) KVM relies on hardware support\nfor pending/delivering these exceptions instead of the software state\nmachine for advancing
