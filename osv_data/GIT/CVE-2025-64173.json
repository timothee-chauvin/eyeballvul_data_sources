{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-64173","published":"2025-11-06T20:42:51Z","modified":"2025-11-07T02:55:10.867975Z","aliases":["GHSA-x33c-7c2v-mrj9"],"summary":"Apollo Router Core: Access Control Bypass on Polymorphic Types","details":"Apollo Router Core is a configurable graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph using Apollo Federation 2. In versions 1.61.11 below, as well as 2.0.0-alpha.0 through 2.8.1-rc.0, a vulnerability allowed for unauthenticated queries to access data that required additional access controls. Router incorrectly handled access control directives on interface types/fields and their implementing object types/fields, applying them to interface types/fields while ignoring directives on their implementing object types/fields when all implementations had the same requirements. Apollo Router customers defining @authenticated, @requiresScopes, or @policy directives inconsistently on polymorphic types (i.e., object types that implement interface types) are impacted. This issue is fixed in versions 1.61.12 and 2.8.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apollographql/router","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"12517bebc84259dc2dd39d33d229358026e174f9"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.61.12"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apollographql/router","events":[{"introduced":"827cfa979e45f636a5a68fcaecf3864ba7534d9d"},{"fixed":"efb0dcbfe8d668e3aeb1ade1513072d449128dc4"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.8.1-rc.0"},{"fixed":"2.8.1"}]}}],"versions":["apollo-federation@0.0.10","apollo-federation@0.0.11","apollo-federation@0.0.2","apollo-federation@0.0.3","apollo-federation@0.0.4","apollo-federation@0.0.5","apollo-federation@0.0.6","apollo-federation@0.0.7","apollo-federation@0.0.8","apollo-federation@0.0.9","v0.1.0-alpha.0","v0.1.0-alpha.1","v0.1.0-alpha.10","v0.1.0-alpha.2","v0.1.0-alpha.3","v0.1.0-alpha.4","v0.1.0-alpha.5","v0.1.0-alpha.6","v0.1.0-alpha.7","v0.1.0-alpha.8","v0.1.0-alpha.9","v0.1.0-prealpha.4","v0.1.0-prealpha.5","v0.1.0-preview.0","v0.1.0-preview.1","v0.1.0-preview.2","v0.1.0-preview.3","v0.1.0-preview.4","v0.1.0-preview.5","v0.1.0-preview.6","v0.1.0-preview.7","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.14.0","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.16.0","v0.9.0","v0.9.0-rc.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.5","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-alpha.0","v1.0.0-alpha.1","v1.0.0-alpha.2","v1.0.0-alpha.3","v1.0.0-rc.0","v1.0.0-rc.1","v1.0.0-rc.2","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.16.0","v1.16.0-alpha.0","v1.17.0","v1.18.0","v1.18.1","v1.19.0","v1.19.0-alpha.0","v1.19.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.20.0","v1.21.0","v1.22.0","v1.23.0","v1.23.0-alpha.0","v1.24.0","v1.25.0","v1.25.0-alpha.2","v1.26.0","v1.27.0","v1.28.0","v1.28.1","v1.29.0","v1.29.0-rc.0","v1.29.0-rc.1","v1.29.1","v1.3.0","v1.30.0","v1.30.0-alpha.0","v1.30.0-alpha.1","v1.30.1","v1.30.1-rc.0","v1.31.0","v1.31.0-alpha.0","v1.31.0-alpha.1","v1.31.0-alpha.2","v1.31.0-alpha.3","v1.31.0-alpha.4","v1.32.0","v1.32.0-alpha.0","v1.32.0-alpha.1","v1.33.0","v1.33.1","v1.33.2","v1.34.0","v1.34.0-alpha.1","v1.34.0-alpha.2","v1.34.1","v1.34.1-rc.0","v1.35.0","v1.35.0-rc.0","v1.35.0-rc.1","v1.35.0-rc.2","v1.36.0","v1.36.0-rc.0","v1.36.0-rc.1","v1.36.0-rc.2","v1.36.0-rc.3","v1.37.0","v1.37.0-rc.0","v1.37.0-rc.1","v1.38.0","v1.38.0-rc.0","v1.38.0-rc.1","v1.38.0-rc.2","v1.39.0","v1.39.0-rc.0","v1.39.1","v1.39.1-rc.0","v1.39.1-rc.1","v1.39.1-rc.2","v1.4.0","v1.40.0","v1.40.0-rc.0","v1.40.0-rc.1","v1.40.1","v1.40.1-rc.0","v1.40.1-rc.1","v1.40.2","v1.40.2-rc.0","v1.41.0","v1.41.0-rc.0","v1.41.0-rc.1","v1.41.0-rc.2","v1.41.0-rc.3","v1.41.0-rc.4","v1.41.1","v1.42.0","v1.42.0-rc.0","v1.42.0-rc.1","v1.43.0","v1.43.0-rc.0","v1.43.0-rc.1","v1.43.1","v1.43.1-rc.0","v1.43.1-rc.1","v1.43.1-rc.2","v1.43.1-rc.3","v1.43.2","v1.43.2-rc.0","v1.43.3-alpha.0","v1.44.0","v1.44.0-alpha.0","v1.44.0-rc.0","v1.45.0","v1.45.0-alpha.0","v1.45.0-alpha.1","v1.45.0-alpha.2","v1.45.0-alpha.3","v1.45.0-alpha.4","v1.45.0-rc.0","v1.45.0-rc.1","v1.45.1","v1.46.0","v1.46.0-rc.0","v1.46.0-rc.1","v1.46.0-rc.2","v1.46.0-rc.3","v1.47.0","v1.47.0-rc.0","v1.48.0","v1.48.0-rc.0","v1.48.1","v1.48.1-rc.0","v1.49.0","v1.49.0-alpha.0","v1.49.0-rc.0","v1.49.0-rc.1","v1.49.1","v1.49.1-rc.0","v1.5.0","v1.50.0","v1.50.0-rc.0","v1.51.0","v1.51.0-rc.0","v1.52.0","v1.52.0-rc.0","v1.52.1","v1.52.1-rc.0","v1.52.1-rc.1","v1.53.0","v1.53.0-rc.0","v1.53.0-rc.1","v1.54.0","v1.54.0-rc.0","v1.54.0-rc.1","v1.54.0-rc.2","v1.54.0-rc.3","v1.55.0","v1.55.0-rc.0","v1.55.0-rc.1","v1.55.0-rc.2","v1.56.0","v1.56.0-rc.0","v1.57.0","v1.57.0-rc.0","v1.57.1","v1.57.1-rc.0","v1.58.0","v1.58.0-rc.0","v1.58.0-rc.1","v1.58.0-rc.2","v1.58.0-rc.3","v1.58.1","v1.58.1-rc.0","v1.58.1-rc.1","v1.59.0","v1.59.0-rc.0","v1.59.1","v1.59.1-rc.0","v1.59.2","v1.59.2-rc.0","v1.6.0","v1.60.0","v1.60.0-rc.0","v1.60.0-rc.1","v1.60.1","v1.60.1-rc.0","v1.60.1-rc.1","v1.61.0","v1.61.0-rc.0","v1.61.1","v1.61.1-rc.0","v1.61.10","v1.61.10-rc.0","v1.61.11","v1.61.11-beta.0","v1.61.11-rc.1","v1.61.12-rc.0","v1.61.2","v1.61.2-rc.0","v1.61.3","v1.61.3-rc.0","v1.61.4","v1.61.4-rc.0","v1.61.5","v1.61.5-rc.0","v1.61.5-rc.1","v1.61.5-rc.2","v1.61.6","v1.61.6-rc.0","v1.61.7","v1.61.7-rc.0","v1.61.7-rc.1","v1.61.7-rc.2","v1.61.8","v1.61.8-rc.0","v1.61.9","v1.61.9-rc.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v2.8.1-rc.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64173.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v2.8.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-x33c-7c2v-mrj9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/authorization#authorization-directives"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-288"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
