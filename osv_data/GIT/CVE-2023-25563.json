Prior to version 1.2.0, multiple out-of-bounds reads when decoding NTLM fields can trigger a denial of service. A 32-bit integer overflow condition can lead to incorrect checks of consistency of length of internal buffers. Although most applications will error out before accepting a singe input buffer of 4GB in length this could theoretically happen. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point if the application allows tokens greater than 4GB in length. This can lead to a large, up to 65KB, out-of-bounds read which could cause a denial-of-service if it reads from unmapped memory. Version 1.2.0 contains a patch for the out-of-bounds reads.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3c3077e2a24b47db1b4c459fb3173ba7f75b9b44"}]}],"versions":["0.8.0","v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-25563.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-jjjx-5qf7-9mgf"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/97c62c6167299028d80765080e74d91dfc99efbd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/releases/tag/v1.2.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-125"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
