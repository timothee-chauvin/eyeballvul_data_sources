{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-23507","published":"2022-12-15T00:01:04Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:26:02.540066Z","aliases":["GHSA-xqqc-c5gw-c5r5"],"summary":"Light client verification not taking into account chain ID","details":"Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault tolerant applications. Versions prior to 0.28.0 contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There are no workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"560c852840ac58cb03b55fc376ff0dc2ac089d94"}]}],"versions":["0.14.0","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.16.0","v0.17.0","v0.17.0-rc1","v0.17.0-rc2","v0.17.0-rc3","v0.17.1","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.19.0","v0.20.0","v0.21.0","v0.22.0","v0.23.0","v0.23.0-internal","v0.23.1","v0.23.2","v0.23.3","v0.23.5","v0.23.6","v0.23.7","v0.23.8","v0.23.8-pre.1","v0.25.0","v0.26.0","v0.27.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23507.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-xqqc-c5gw-c5r5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-347"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
