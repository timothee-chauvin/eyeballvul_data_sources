{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-45304","published":"2024-08-30T23:51:01Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:43:24.112937Z","aliases":["GHSA-w2px-25pm-2cf9"],"summary":"OwnableTwoStep allows a pending owner to accept ownership after the original owner has renounced ownership in cairo-contracts","details":"Cairo-Contracts are OpenZeppelin Contracts written in Cairo for Starknet, a decentralized ZK Rollup. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized ownership transfer, contrary to the original owner's intention of leaving the contract without an owner. It introduces a security risk where an unintended party (pending owner) can gain control of the contract after the original owner has renounced ownership. This could also be used by a malicious owner to simulate leaving a contract without an owner, to later regain ownership by previously having proposed himself as a pending owner. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.16.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openzeppelin/cairo-contracts","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ba00ce76a93dcf25c081ab2698da20690b5a1cfb"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","v0.1.0","v0.13.0","v0.15.0-rc.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45304.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-w2px-25pm-2cf9"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/commit/ef87d7847980e0cf83f4b7f3ff23e6590fb643ec"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/releases/tag/v0.16.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-670"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
