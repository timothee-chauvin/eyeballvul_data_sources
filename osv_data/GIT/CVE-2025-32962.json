Versions prior to 4.6.2 would allow for a malicious unauthenticated actor to perform an open redirect by manipulating the Host header in HTTP requests. Flask-AppBuilder 4.6.2 introduced the `FAB_SAFE_REDIRECT_HOSTS` configuration variable, which allows administrators to explicitly define which domains are considered safe for redirection. As a workaround, use a reverse proxy to enforce trusted host headers.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dpgaspar/flask-appbuilder","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"795f8f8f306fa687e16fa06309027e5f5d5e3b34"}]}],"versions":["3.1.1","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.12.3","v1.12.4","v1.12.5","v1.13.0","v1.8.1","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v1.9.6","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.10","v2.1.11","v2.1.12","v2.1.13","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.1.6","v2.1.7","v2.1.8","v2.1.9","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.1rc1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.2.3","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.3.4","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.4.2","v3.4.3","v3.4.4","v3.4.5","v4.0.0","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.1.3","v4.1.4","v4.1.5","v4.1.6","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.3.10","v4.3.11","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v4.3.4","v4.3.5","v4.3.6","v4.3.7","v4.3.8","v4.3.9","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.5.2","v4.5.3","v4.5.4","v4.6.0","v4.6.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-32962.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/security/advisories/GHSA-99pm-ch96-ccp2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/commit/32eedbbb5cb483a3e782c5f2732de4a6a650d9b6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
