The semaphore is acquired for writing when\nadding / removing notifiers to / from the chain and acquired for reading\nwhen traversing the chain and informing notifiers about an event.\n\nIn case of the blocking switchdev notification chain, recursive\nnotifications are possible which leads to the semaphore being acquired\ntwice for reading and to lockdep warnings being generated [1].\n\nSpecifically, this can happen when the bridge driver processes a\nSWITCHDEV_BRPORT_UNOFFLOADED event which causes it to emit notifications\nabout deferred events when calling switchdev_deferred_process().\n\nFix this by converting the notification chain to a raw notification\nchain in a similar fashion to the netdev notification chain. Protect\nthe chain using the RTNL mutex by acquiring it when modifying the chain.\nEvents are always informed under the RTNL mutex, but add an assertion in\ncall_switchdev_blocking_notifiers() to make sure this is not violated in\nthe future.\n\nMaintain the \"blocking\" prefix as events are always emitted from process\ncontext and listeners are allowed to block.\n\n[1]:\nWARNING: possible
