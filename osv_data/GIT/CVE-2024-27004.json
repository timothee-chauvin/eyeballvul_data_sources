This thread holds the clk\nprepare_lock, and is trying to runtime PM resume a device, when it finds\nthat the device is in the process of resuming so the thread schedule()s\naway waiting for the device to finish resuming before continuing. The\nsecond thread is runtime PM resuming the same device, but the runtime\nresume callback is calling clk_prepare(), trying to grab the\nprepare_lock waiting on the first thread.\n\nThis is a classic ABBA deadlock. To properly fix the deadlock, we must\nnever runtime PM resume or suspend a device with the clk prepare_lock\nheld. Actually doing that is near impossible today because the global\nprepare_lock would have to be dropped in the middle of the tree, the\ndevice runtime PM resumed/suspended, and then the prepare_lock grabbed\nagain to ensure consistency of the clk tree topology. If anything\nchanges with the clk tree in the meantime, we've lost and will need to\nstart the operation all over again.\n\nLuckily, most of the time we're simply incrementing or decrementing the\nruntime PM count on an active device, so we don't have the chance to\nschedule away with the prepare_lock held.
