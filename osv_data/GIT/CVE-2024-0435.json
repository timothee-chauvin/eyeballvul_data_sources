Additionally, the location in which the XSS renders is only limited to the user who submits the XSS. \n\nUltimately, this attack is limited to the user attacking themselves. There is no anonymous chat submission unless the user does not take the minimum steps required to protect their instance.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a4ace56a401ffc8ce0082d7444159dfd5dc28834"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-0435.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/53308220-8b2e-492f-b248-0985b7c2db61"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/a4ace56a401ffc8ce0082d7444159dfd5dc28834"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
