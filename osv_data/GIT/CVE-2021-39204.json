Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, incorrectly handles resetting of HTTP/2 streams with excessive complexity. This can lead to high CPU utilization when a large number of streams are reset. This can result in a DoS condition. Pomerium versions 0.14.8 and 0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with this vulnerability patched.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"5c801b25cae04f06bf48248c90e87d623d7a6283"},{"fixed":"0de60452be1fa329c16076916b6bfe1f672aeed4"}]}],"versions":["v1.17.0","v1.17.1","v1.17.2","v1.17.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-39204.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d3a90a03b6b3bc0f5e821d7b544464cb28320d2f"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.0-rc1","v0.10.0-rc2","v0.10.0-rc3","v0.11.0","v0.11.0-rc1","v0.11.0-rc2","v0.12.0","v0.14.0","v0.14.0-rc2","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.14.4","v0.14.5","v0.14.6","v0.14.7","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.8.0","v0.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-39204.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/envoy-announce/c/5xBpsEZZDfE/m/wD05NZBbAgAJ"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-3xh3-33v5-chcc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/security/advisories/GHSA-5wjf-62hw-q78r"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
