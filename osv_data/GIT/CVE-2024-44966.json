However, it did not disable the code which initializes the\narray, resulting in the corruption of sizeof(long) bytes before the DATA\nsegment, generally the end of the TEXT segment.\n\nIntroduce MAX_SHARED_LIBS_UPDATE which depends on the state of\nCONFIG_BINFMT_FLAT_NO_DATA_START_OFFSET to guard the initialization of\nthe shared library pointer region so that it will only be initialized\nif
