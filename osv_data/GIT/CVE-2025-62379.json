{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62379","published":"2025-10-15T15:57:57Z","modified":"2025-10-31T02:44:28.397591Z","aliases":["GHSA-rfh5-c9h5-q8jm"],"summary":"Open Redirect in reflex-dev/reflex","details":"Reflex is a library to build full-stack web apps in pure Python. In versions 0.5.4 through 0.8.14, the /auth-codespace endpoint automatically assigns the redirect_to query parameter value directly to client-side links without any validation and triggers automatic clicks when the page loads in a GitHub Codespaces environment. This allows attackers to redirect users to arbitrary external URLs. The vulnerable route is only registered when a Codespaces environment is detected, and the detection is controlled by environment variables. The same behavior can be activated in production if the GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN environment variable is set. The vulnerability occurs because the code assigns the redirect_to query parameter directly to a.href without any validation and immediately triggers a click (automatic navigation), allowing users to be sent to arbitrary external domains. The execution condition is based on the presence of a sessionStorage flag, meaning it triggers immediately on first visits or in incognito/private browsing windows, with no server-side origin/scheme whitelist or internal path enforcement defenses in place. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.15. As a workaround, users can ensure that GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN is not set in a production environment.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ade12549f3c0ddab3d7382c581bc04a3c1f989ec"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.10","v0.1.11","v0.1.12","v0.1.13","v0.1.14","v0.1.15","v0.1.16","v0.1.17","v0.1.18","v0.1.19","v0.1.20","v0.1.21","v0.1.22","v0.1.23","v0.1.24","v0.1.25","v0.1.26","v0.1.27","v0.1.28","v0.1.29","v0.1.30","v0.1.31","v0.1.32","v0.1.33","v0.1.34","v0.1.5","v0.1.8","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.8","v0.2.9","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.3.8","v0.3.9","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.7","v0.7.11","v0.7.12","v0.7.7","v0.8.10"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62379.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex/security/advisories/GHSA-rfh5-c9h5-q8jm"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex/commit/ade12549f3c0ddab3d7382c581bc04a3c1f989ec"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
