This can be accomplished via the DOM using a standard parser feature, or via SAX using the XERCES_DISABLE_DTD environment variable.\n\nThis issue has been disclosed before as CVE-2018-1311, but unfortunately that advisory incorrectly stated the issue would be fixed in version 3.2.3 or 3.2.4.\n\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/xerces-c","events":[{"introduced":"dff58dbe688f585de2ec0b171d2fad9efd5e468a"},{"fixed":"53c16411466bf90c62617831fe92ed0f41e70882"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-23807.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/apache/xerces-c/pull/54"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/c497tgn864tsbm8w0bo3f0d81s07zk9r"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
