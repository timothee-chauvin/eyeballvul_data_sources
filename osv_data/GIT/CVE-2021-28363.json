The initial connection to the HTTPS proxy (if an SSLContext isn't given via proxy_config) doesn't verify the hostname of the certificate. This means certificates for different servers that still validate properly with the default urllib3 SSLContext will be silently accepted.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8d65ea1ecf6e2cdc27d42124e587c1b83a3118b0"}]}],"versions":["0.3","0.3.1","0.4","0.4.1","1.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.1","1.10","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.2","1.2.1","1.25","1.25.1","1.25.2","1.25.3","1.25.4","1.25.5","1.25.6","1.25.7","1.25.8","1.26.0","1.26.1","1.26.2","1.26.3","1.3","1.4","1.5","1.6","1.7","1.7.1","1.8","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.9","1.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-28363.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/8d65ea1ecf6e2cdc27d42124e587c1b83a3118b0"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commits/main"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-5phf-pp7p-vc2r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/1.26.4/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-36"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-02"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0007/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4S65ZQVZ2ODGB52IC7VJDBUK4M5INCXL/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
