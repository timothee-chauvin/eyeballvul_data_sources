  "details": "Starch versions 0.14 and earlier generate session ids insecurely.\n\nThe default session id generator returns a SHA-1 hash seeded with a counter, the epoch time, the built-in rand function, the PID, and internal Perl reference addresses. The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.\n\nPredicable session ids could allow an attacker to gain access to systems.",
