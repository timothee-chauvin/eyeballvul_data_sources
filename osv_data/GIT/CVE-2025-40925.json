The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.\n\nPredicable session ids could allow an attacker to gain access to systems.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bluefeet/starch","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5573449e64e0660f7ee209d1eab5881d4ccbee3b"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40925.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/bluefeet/Starch/commit/5573449e64e0660f7ee209d1eab5881d4ccbee3b.patch"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/bluefeet/Starch/pull/5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://metacpan.org/dist/Starch/source/lib/Starch/Manager.pm"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
