Starting in version 2.5.0 and prior to version 2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring assignment syntax in the user export code path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local disk. This issue is patched in version 2.8.7. As a workaround, site maintainers can cherry pick the fix into their codebase to patch the exploit.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nodebb/nodebb","events":[{"introduced":"c3e19005f6b18bfee734c9c17be3e7377d3e4208"},{"fixed":"6976925943ff12eedf34c543623872c4ed143e9e"}]}],"versions":["v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v2.5.3","v2.5.4","v2.5.5","v2.5.6","v2.5.7","v2.5.8","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.8.3","v2.8.4","v2.8.5","v2.8.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-26045.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/security/advisories/GHSA-vh2g-6c4x-5hmp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230831-0004/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/ec58700f6dff8e5b4af1544f6205ec362b593092"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
