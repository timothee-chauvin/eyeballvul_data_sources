{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-34707","published":"2024-05-13T19:22:41.202Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:28:02.132990Z","aliases":["GHSA-r2hr-4v48-fjv3"],"summary":"Nautobot's BANNER_* configuration can be used to inject arbitrary HTML content into Nautobot pages","details":"Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. A Nautobot user with admin privileges can modify the `BANNER_TOP`, `BANNER_BOTTOM`, and `BANNER_LOGIN` configuration settings via the `/admin/constance/config/` endpoint. Normally these settings are used to provide custom banner text at the top and bottom of all Nautobot web pages (or specifically on the login page in the case of `BANNER_LOGIN`) but it was reported that an admin user can make use of these settings to inject arbitrary HTML, potentially exposing Nautobot users to security issues such as cross-site scripting (stored XSS). The vulnerability is fixed in Nautobot 1.6.22 and 2.2.4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"becc2b27b24ffd365e119b94240458ef9305bc28"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.22"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot","events":[{"introduced":"3013f25b41a1409adb815afb654fad4988f640ef"},{"fixed":"445210cce3f1a4de336f04b5033be5f3fae72f1a"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.2.4"}]}}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.0a1","v1.0.0a2","v1.0.0b1","v1.0.0b2","v1.0.0b3","v1.0.0b4","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.0b1","v1.1.0b2","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.0b1","v1.2.1","v1.2.10","v1.2.11","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.2.9","v1.3","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-beta.1","v1.3.1","v1.3.10","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v1.4.0","v1.4.0-alpha.1","v1.4.0-alpha.2","v1.4.0-beta.1","v1.4.0-rc.1","v1.4.1","v1.4.10","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.4.7","v1.4.8","v1.4.9","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-beta.1","v1.5.1","v1.5.10","v1.5.11","v1.5.12","v1.5.13","v1.5.14","v1.5.15","v1.5.16","v1.5.17","v1.5.18","v1.5.19","v1.5.2","v1.5.20","v1.5.21","v1.5.22","v1.5.23","v1.5.24","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.5.6","v1.5.7","v1.5.8","v1.5.9","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc.1","v1.6.1","v1.6.10","v1.6.11","v1.6.12","v1.6.13","v1.6.14","v1.6.15","v1.6.16","v1.6.17","v1.6.18","v1.6.19","v1.6.2","v1.6.20","v1.6.21","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.6.9","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.1.6","v2.1.7","v2.1.8","v2.1.9","v2.2.0","v2.2.0-beta.1","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-34707.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/4f0a66bd6307bfe0e0acb899233e0d4ad516f51c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/f640aedc69c848d3d1be57f0300fc40033ff6423"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5697"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5698"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-r2hr-4v48-fjv3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L"}]}
