In particular on an SR-IOV device VFs\nmay be removed and later re-added.\n\nIn commit a50297cf8235 (\"s390/pci: separate zbus creation from\nscanning\") it was missed however that struct pci_bus and struct\nzpci_bus's resource list retained a reference to the PCI functions MMIO\nresources even though those resources are released and freed on\nhot-unplug. These stale resources may subsequently be claimed when the\nPCI function re-appears resulting in use-after-free.\n\nOne idea of fixing this use-after-free in s390 specific code that was\ninvestigated was to simply keep resources around from the moment a PCI\nfunction first appeared until the whole virtual PCI bus created for\na multi-function device disappears. The problem with this however is\nthat due to the requirement of artificial MMIO addreesses (address\ncookies) extra logic is then needed to keep the address cookies\ncompatible on re-plug. At the same time the MMIO resources semantically\nbelong to the PCI function so tying their lifecycle to the function\nseems more logical.\n\nInstead a simpler approach is to remove the resources of an individually\nhot-unplugged PCI function from the PCI bus's resource list while\nkeeping the resources of other PCI functions on the PCI bus untouched.\n\nThis is done by introducing pci_bus_remove_resource() to remove an\nindividual resource. Similarly the resource also needs to be removed\nfrom the struct zpci_bus's resource list. It turns out however, that\nthere is really no need to add the MMIO resources to the struct\nzpci_bus's resource list at all and instead we can simply use the\nzpci_bar_struct's resource pointer directly.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a50297cf8235b062bcdeaa8b1dad58e69d3e1b43"},{"fixed":"437bb839e36cc9f35adc6d2a2bf113b7a0fc9985"},{"fixed":"a2410d0c3d2d714ed968a135dfcbed6aa3ff7027"},{"fixed":"b99ebf4b62774e690e73a551cf5fbf6f219bdd96"},{"fixed":"ab909509850b27fd39b8ba99e44cda39dbc3858c"}]}],"versions":["v5.12","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.100","v5.15.101","v5.15.102","v5.15.103","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.89","v5.15.9","v5.15.90","v5.15.91","v5.15.92","v5.15.93","v5.15.94","v5.15.95","v5.15.96","v5.15.97","v5.15.98","v5.15.99","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4","v6.2.5","v6.2.6","v6.2.7","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53123.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.13.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.104"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.21"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53123.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/437bb839e36cc9f35adc6d2a2bf113b7a0fc9985"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a2410d0c3d2d714ed968a135dfcbed6aa3ff7027"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ab909509850b27fd39b8ba99e44cda39dbc3858c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b99ebf4b62774e690e73a551cf5fbf6f219bdd96"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53123.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53123"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53123.json"}}
