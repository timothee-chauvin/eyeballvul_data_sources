{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-36065","published":"2022-09-06T21:05:10Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:33:50.205947Z","aliases":["GHSA-j24q-55xh-wm4r"],"summary":"GrowthBook account creation and file upload vulnerability in self-hosted configurations","details":"GrowthBook is an open-source platform for feature flagging and A/B testing. With some self-hosted configurations in versions prior to 2022-08-29, attackers can register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a Python script to the right location, they can execute arbitrary code within the container. To be affected, ALL of the following must be true: Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected); using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage); NODE_ENV set to a non-production value and JWT_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like `dev`. This issue is patched in commit 1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264 (2022-08-29). As a workaround, set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string. This will stop arbitrary file uploads, but the only way to stop attackers from registering accounts is by updating to the latest build.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-36065.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/security/advisories/GHSA-j24q-55xh-wm4r"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/commit/1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/pull/487"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-24"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
