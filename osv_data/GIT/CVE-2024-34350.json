{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-34350","published":"2024-05-09T16:07:44.499Z","modified":"2025-12-05T04:21:14.936888Z","aliases":["GHSA-77r5-gw3j-2mpf"],"summary":"Next.js Vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling","details":"Next.js is a React framework that can provide building blocks to create web applications. Prior to 13.5.1, an inconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request meant that requests are treated as both a single request, and two separate requests by Next.js, leading to desynchronized responses. This led to a response queue poisoning vulnerability in the affected Next.js versions. For a request to be exploitable, the affected route also had to be making use of the [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) feature in Next.js. The vulnerability is resolved in Next.js `13.5.1` and newer.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js","events":[{"introduced":"fb12a6dc877c5ce2f21246f4921494a1b8e356a6"},{"fixed":"0c1c7f847ee820f93bdf08e809b1e2e62230ab4b"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-34350.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/34xxx/CVE-2024-34350.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-77r5-gw3j-2mpf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34350"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-444"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/34xxx/CVE-2024-34350.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
