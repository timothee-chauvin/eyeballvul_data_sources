In Jupyter Server before version 1.1.1, an open redirect vulnerability could cause the jupyter server to redirect the browser to a different malicious website. All jupyter servers running without a base_url prefix are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. This same vulnerability was patched in upstream notebook v5.7.8. This is fixed in jupyter_server 1.1.1. If upgrade is not available, a workaround can be to run your server on a url prefix: \"jupyter server --ServerApp.base_url=/jupyter/\".","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"85e4abccf6ea9321d29153f73b0bd72ccb3a6bca"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2","0.0.3","0.0.4","0.0.5","0.1.0","0.1.1","0.2.0","0.3.0","1.0.0","1.0.0rc1","1.0.0rc10","1.0.0rc11","1.0.0rc12","1.0.0rc13","1.0.0rc14","1.0.0rc15","1.0.0rc16","1.0.0rc2","1.0.0rc3","1.0.0rc4","1.0.0rc5","1.0.0rc6","1.0.0rc7","1.0.0rc8","1.0.0rc9","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-26275.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://advisory.checkmarx.net/advisory/CX-2020-4291"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/commit/85e4abccf6ea9321d29153f73b0bd72ccb3a6bca"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/security/advisories/GHSA-9f66-54xg-pc2c"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-server/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
