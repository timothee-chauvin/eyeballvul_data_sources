The method violates Rust's aliasing rules by modifying a data structure through a mutable pointer while only holding an immutable reference, which can lead to undefined behavior when the data is accessed later.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/meh/rust-ffmpeg","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"69befd291b5991b7542b8b2784c52c60bf248578"}]}],"versions":["v0.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-57616.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/meh/rust-ffmpeg/issues/192"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
