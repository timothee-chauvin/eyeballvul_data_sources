This makes sure the\nconfig cannot be freed while recv_work is still running, even if clear\n+ reconfigure interleave.\n\nIn addition, we don't need to worry about recv_work dropping the last\nnbd_put (which causes deadlock):\n\npath A (netlink with NBD_CFLAG_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT):\n  connect  // nbd_refs=1 (trigger recv_work)\n  open nbd // nbd_refs=2\n  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK\n  close nbd\n
