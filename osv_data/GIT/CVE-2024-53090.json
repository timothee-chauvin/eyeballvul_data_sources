The problem is that it\nis called from AF_RXRPC whilst holding the ->notify_lock, but it tries to\ntake a ref on the afs_call struct in order to pass it to a work queue - but\nif the afs_call is already queued, we then have an extraneous ref that must\nbe put... calling afs_put_call() may call back down into AF_RXRPC through\nrxrpc_kernel_shutdown_call(), however, which might try taking the\n->notify_lock again.\n\nThis case isn't very common, however, so defer it to a workqueue.  The oops\nlooks something like:\n\n  BUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0, krxrpcio/7001/1646\n   lock: 0xffff888141399b30, .magic: dead4ead, .owner: krxrpcio/7001/1646, .owner_cpu: 0\n  CPU: 0 UID: 0
