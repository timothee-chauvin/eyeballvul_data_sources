Starting in version 0.4.3 and prior to version 0.5.0, the administrative password was leaked through the command line parameter. The problem was patched in version 0.5.0. As a workaround, pass `--read-bearer-token-from-stdin` to the launch arguments and feed the token from the standard input in version 0.4.14 or later. Earlier versions do not have this workaround.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kisaragieffective/toy-blog","events":[{"introduced":"65f3c33783219fcd9ae63ad3ee70a2bed47897a5"},{"fixed":"7083b914f6eb6b558a6bbc607e53021dec8e495d"}]}],"versions":["0.4.10","0.4.11","0.4.12","0.4.13","0.4.14","0.4.15","0.4.3","0.4.4","0.4.5","0.4.6","0.4.7","0.4.8","0.4.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-39314.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/39xxx/CVE-2024-39314.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/KisaragiEffective/toy-blog/commit/4d003e46a944d8f44ea02c63f4beefa4cbe1f4f7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/KisaragiEffective/toy-blog/security/advisories/GHSA-q8g2-c3x5-gp89"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39314"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-200","CWE-214"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/39xxx/CVE-2024-39314.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
