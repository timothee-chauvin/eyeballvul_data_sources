In versions 0.2.0 and below, the `prosemirror_to_html` gem is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks through malicious HTML attribute values. While tag content is properly escaped, attribute values are not, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. Applications that use `prosemirror_to_html` to convert ProseMirror documents to HTML, user-generated ProseMirror content, and end users viewing the rendered HTML output are all at risk of attack. This issue is fixed in version 0.2.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/etaminstudio/prosemirror_to_html","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3c5d11693790bbb080c70af2e9ccd85d52050392"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64501.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64501.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/etaminstudio/prosemirror_to_html/commit/4d59f94f550bcabeec30d298791bbdd883298ad8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/etaminstudio/prosemirror_to_html/security/advisories/GHSA-52c5-vh7f-26fx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64501"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64501.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
