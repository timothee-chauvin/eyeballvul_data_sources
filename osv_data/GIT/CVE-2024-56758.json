The result of that is that a different thread can modify the\nmapping (like remove it with invalidate) before we call folio_lock().\nThis results in an invalid page and we need to try again.\n\nIn particular, if we are relocating concurrently with aborting a\ntransaction, this can result in a crash like the following:\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\n  PGD 0 P4D 0\n  Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP\n  CPU: 76 PID: 1411631 Comm: kworker/u322:5\n  Workqueue: events_unbound btrfs_reclaim_bgs_work\n  RIP: 0010:set_page_extent_mapped+0x20/0xb0\n  RSP: 0018:ffffc900516a7be8 EFLAGS: 00010246\n  RAX: ffffea009e851d08 RBX: ffffea009e0b1880 RCX: 0000000000000000\n  RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffc900516a7b90 RDI: ffffea009e0b1880\n  RBP: 0000000003573000 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: ffff88c07fd2f3f0\n  R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000194754b575be R12: 0000000003572000\n  R13: 0000000003572fff R14: 0000000000100cca R15: 0000000005582fff\n  FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88c07fd00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 000000407d00f002 CR4: 00000000007706f0\n  DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n  DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n  PKRU: 55555554\n  Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  ? __die+0x78/0xc0\n  ? page_fault_oops+0x2a8/0x3a0\n  ? __switch_to+0x133/0x530\n  ? wq_worker_running+0xa/0x40\n  ? exc_page_fault+0x63/0x130\n  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x30\n  ? set_page_extent_mapped+0x20/0xb0\n  relocate_file_extent_cluster+0x1a7/0x940\n  relocate_data_extent+0xaf/0x120\n  relocate_block_group+0x20f/0x480\n  btrfs_relocate_block_group+0x152/0x320\n  btrfs_relocate_chunk+0x3d/0x120\n  btrfs_reclaim_bgs_work+0x2ae/0x4e0\n  process_scheduled_works+0x184/0x370\n  worker_thread+0xc6/0x3e0\n  ? blk_add_timer+0xb0/0xb0\n  kthread+0xae/0xe0\n  ? flush_tlb_kernel_range+0x90/0x90\n  ret_from_fork+0x2f/0x40\n  ? flush_tlb_kernel_range+0x90/0x90\n  ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20\n  </TASK>\n\nThis occurs because cleanup_one_transaction() calls\ndestroy_delalloc_inodes() which calls invalidate_inode_pages2() which\ntakes the folio_lock before setting mapping to NULL.

that introduced the\nrace (the very first iteration of this code from 2009) but a more recent\nchange that made this particular crash happen in
