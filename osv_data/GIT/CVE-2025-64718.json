In js-yaml 4.1.0 and below, it's possible for an attacker to modify the prototype of the result of a parsed yaml document via prototype pollution (`__proto__`). All users who parse untrusted yaml documents may be impacted. The problem is patched in js-yaml 4.1.1. Users can protect against this kind of attack on the server by using `node --disable-proto=delete` or `deno` (in Deno, pollution protection is on by default).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"cc482e775913e6625137572a3712d2826170e53a"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.2","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.3.3","0.3.4","0.3.5","0.3.6","0.3.7","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.1.3","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.1.0","3.10.0","3.11.0","3.12.0","3.12.1","3.12.2","3.13.0","3.13.1","3.14.0","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.2.4","3.2.5","3.2.6","3.2.7","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.4.0","3.4.1","3.4.2","3.4.3","3.4.4","3.4.5","3.4.6","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.5.2","3.5.3","3.5.4","3.5.5","3.6.0","3.6.1","3.7.0","3.8.0","3.8.1","3.8.2","3.8.3","3.8.4","3.9.0","3.9.1","4.0.0","4.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64718.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64718.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/commit/383665ff4248ec2192d1274e934462bb30426879"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/security/advisories/GHSA-mh29-5h37-fv8m"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64718"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-1321"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64718.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
