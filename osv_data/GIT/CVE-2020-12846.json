There is potential abuse of /service/upload servlet in the webmail subsystem. A user can upload executable files (exe,sh,bat,jar) in the Contact section of the mailbox as an avatar image for a contact. A user will receive a \"Corrupt File\" error, but the file is still uploaded and stored locally in /opt/zimbra/data/tmp/upload/, leaving it open to possible remote execution.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zimbra/zm-build","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ac6081fa002b1511e926aba37740d2b6c20f3f43"}]}],"versions":["8.7.10","8.7.11","8.7.6","8.7.7","8.7.9","8.8.0.beta1","8.8.10","8.8.11","8.8.11.p3","8.8.12","8.8.2","8.8.3","8.8.4","8.8.6","8.8.7","8.8.8","8.8.9","8.8.9.p1","8.8.9.p3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-12846.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zimbra/zm-mailbox","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d30e647f21ecef5490f21facf2e06e228b44a36e"}]}],"versions":["8.7.10","8.7.11","8.7.6","8.7.7","8.7.9","8.8.0.beta1","8.8.10","8.8.11","8.8.12","8.8.2","8.8.3","8.8.4","8.8.5","8.8.6","8.8.7","8.8.8","8.8.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-12846.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"130804680382483964301386928646396783356","length":461},"id":"CVE-2020-12846-4314dc38","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/zimbra/zm-mailbox/commit/d30e647f21ecef5490f21facf2e06e228b44a36e","target":{"file":"store/src/java/com/zimbra/cs/account/ldap/LdapProvisioning.java","function":"updateLastLogon"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["35532726304441886843822597725517922529","86869606749296562789619135716824747966","329209388892522800440224682947664957145","301198994465565842404478996247629867721","249110717571679374632676844697594286961","165150619554600532748713227738510509377","135793442757343879754509969633552703576","99023990949396355242231588957425096724"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2020-12846-96c6e311","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/zimbra/zm-mailbox/commit/d30e647f21ecef5490f21facf2e06e228b44a36e","target":{"file":"store/src/java/com/zimbra/cs/account/ldap/LdapProvisioning.java"}}]}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zimbra/zm-zcs","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6c72db05e6f1b89c511ba5c08ec4b6399bec7bb6"}]}],"versions":["8.7.10","8.7.11","8.7.6","8.7.7","8.7.9","8.8.0.beta1","8.8.0beta2","8.8.10","8.8.11","8.8.12","8.8.2","8.8.3","8.8.4","8.8.5","8.8.6","8.8.7","8.8.8","8.8.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-12846.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zimbra/zm-zcs-lib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"41db44a222b547dcc89ab50273cb8684195c09c2"}]}],"versions":["8.7.10","8.7.11","8.7.6","8.7.7","8.7.9","8.8.0.beta1","8.8.10","8.8.11","8.8.12","8.8.2","8.8.3","8.8.4","8.8.5","8.8.6","8.8.7","8.8.8","8.8.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-12846.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security_Center"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/9.0.0/P3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Security_Advisories"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
