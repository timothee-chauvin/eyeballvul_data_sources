{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-27781","published":"2025-03-19T20:22:38Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:34:03.551672Z","summary":"Applio allows unsafe deserialization in inference.py","details":"Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to unsafe deserialization in inference.py. `model_file` in inference.py as well as `model_file` in tts.py take user-supplied input (e.g. a path to a model) and pass that value to the `change_choices` and later to `get_speakers_id` function, which loads that model with `torch.load` in inference.py (line 326 in 3.2.8-bugfix), which is vulnerable to unsafe deserialization. The issue can lead to remote code execution. A patch is available on the `main` branch of the repository.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/iahispano/applio","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"eb21d9dd349a6ae1a28c440b30d306eafba65097"}]}],"versions":["3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","3.0.8","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.2.4","3.2.5","3.2.6","3.2.7","3.2.8-bugfix"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27781.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/tabs/inference/inference.py#L325"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/tabs/inference/inference.py#L338-L345"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/tabs/tts/tts.py#L50-L57"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/commit/eb21d9dd349a6ae1a28c440b30d306eafba65097"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-341_GHSL-2024-353_Applio/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
