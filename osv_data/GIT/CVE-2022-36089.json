In KubeVela prior to versions 1.4.11 and 1.5.4, VelaUX APIServer uses the `PlatformID` as the signed key to generate the JWT tokens for users. Another API called `getSystemInfo` exposes the platformID. This vulnerability allows users to use the platformID to re-generate the JWT tokens to bypass the authentication. Versions 1.4.11 and 1.5.4 contain a patch for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela","events":[{"introduced":"8f7a8258fe0f82107208eaa13aee264ad0d6ce7e"},{"fixed":"7df2b34a0b170c3a90fed5ddc7e518a4c8258c61"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela","events":[{"introduced":"e29b1af20288d25f5addb268fef83fe21fd1f689"},{"fixed":"58ca3a820d407d5a3cfb692194c4a9662d50595e"}]}],"versions":["v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.10","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.4.7","v1.4.7-patch","v1.4.8","v1.4.9","v1.5.0","v1.5.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-36089.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/security/advisories/GHSA-cq42-w295-r29q"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kubevela/kubevela/pull/4634"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-294"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N"}]}
