A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the 404 error handling logic of wabac.js v2.23.10 and below. The parameter `requestURL` (derived from the original request target) is directly embedded into an inline `<script>` block without sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious URL that executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victimâ€™s browser. The scope may be limited by CORS policies, depending on the situation in which wabac.js is used. The vulnerability is fixed in wabac.js v2.23.11.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/webrecorder/wabac.js","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0c59ee0081c8327adb23309c22668554339ab741"}]}],"versions":["2.12.0","2.13.15","2.14.0","v.2.15.5","v2.14.1","v2.15.0","v2.15.2","v2.15.3","v2.15.4","v2.16.0","v2.16.1","v2.16.10","v2.16.11","v2.16.12","v2.16.13","v2.16.2","v2.16.3","v2.16.4","v2.16.5","v2.16.6","v2.16.7","v2.16.8","v2.16.9","v2.17.0","v2.17.1","v2.17.2","v2.17.3","v2.18.0","v2.18.1","v2.18.2","v2.18.3","v2.18.4","v2.19.0","v2.19.1","v2.19.2","v2.19.3","v2.19.4","v2.19.5","v2.19.6","v2.19.7","v2.19.8","v2.19.9","v2.20.0","v2.20.1","v2.20.2","v2.20.3","v2.20.4","v2.20.5","v2.20.6","v2.20.7","v2.20.8","v2.21.0","v2.21.1","v2.21.2","v2.21.3","v2.21.4","v2.22.0","v2.22.0-beta.0","v2.22.1","v2.22.10","v2.22.11","v2.22.12","v2.22.13","v2.22.14","v2.22.15","v2.22.16","v2.22.17","v2.22.2","v2.22.3","v2.22.4","v2.22.5","v2.22.6","v2.22.7","v2.22.8","v2.22.9","v2.23.0","v2.23.1","v2.23.10","v2.23.2","v2.23.3","v2.23.4","v2.23.5","v2.23.6","v2.23.7","v2.23.8","v2.23.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58765.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/webrecorder/wabac.js/security/advisories/GHSA-w765-jm6w-4hhj"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/webrecorder/wabac.js/commit/25feb4a5af69a6b65694426eae67b890be438c4c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/webrecorder/wabac.js/releases/tag/v2.23.11"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
