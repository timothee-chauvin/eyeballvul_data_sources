OpenFGA versions v1.1.0 and prior are vulnerable to a DoS attack when Check and ListObjects calls are executed against authorization models that contain circular relationship definitions. Users are affected by this vulnerability if they are using OpenFGA v1.1.0 or earlier, and if you are executing `Check` or `ListObjects` calls against a vulnerable authorization model. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.1.1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users that do not have circular relationships in their models are not affected.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openfga/openfga","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a989901713e12401af7d2b02c36235eebf24f933"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-35933.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/openfga/openfga/commit/087ce392595f3c319ab3028b5089118ea4063452"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-hr9r-8phq-5x8j"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/Check"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-835"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
