When the libssh SCP client connects to a server, the scp command, which includes a user-provided path, is executed on the server-side. In case the library is used in a way where users can influence the third parameter of the function, it would become possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, leading to a compromise of the remote target.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.com/libssh/libssh-mirror","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7850307210590a9a1b03ab0273d29b3926a974c5"}]}],"versions":["libssh-0.8.0","libssh-0.8.1","libssh-0.8.2","libssh-0.8.3","libssh-0.8.4","libssh-0.8.5","libssh-0.8.6","libssh-0.8.7","release-0-3-0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-14889.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00029.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7JJWJTXVWLLJTVHBPGWL7472S5FWXYQR/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EV2ONSPDJCTDVORCB4UGRQUZQQ46JHRN/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-12/msg00033.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00047.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-14889"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/12/msg00020.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-27"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4219-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2019-14889.txt"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
