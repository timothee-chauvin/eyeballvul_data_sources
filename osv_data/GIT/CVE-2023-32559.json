The use of the deprecated API `process.binding()` can bypass the policy mechanism by requiring internal modules and eventually take advantage of `process.binding('spawn_sync')` run arbitrary code, outside of the limits defined in a `policy.json` file. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the policy is an experimental feature of Node.js.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nodejs/node","events":[{"introduced":"49a77a5a996a49e8cb728eed42e55a7c1a9eef6e"},{"last_affected":"a39b8a2a3e8414c8a54650bdfe4a46998282d88a"},{"introduced":"7162e686b18d22b4385fa5c04274fb04dbd810c7"},{"last_affected":"b53c51995380b1f8d642297d848cab6010d2909c"},{"introduced":"e7618fb5a5fc25d76b6474e2a6607f04fd6f10e0"},{"last_affected":"f13c7f5008ecbd166e6aba6702dfa84da1863ece"}]}],"versions":["v16.0.0","v16.1.0","v16.10.0","v16.11.0","v16.11.1","v16.12.0","v16.13.0","v16.13.1","v16.13.2","v16.14.0","v16.14.1","v16.14.2","v16.15.0","v16.15.1","v16.16.0","v16.17.0","v16.17.1","v16.18.0","v16.18.1","v16.19.0","v16.19.1","v16.2.0","v16.20.0","v16.20.1","v16.3.0","v16.4.0","v16.4.1","v16.4.2","v16.5.0","v16.6.0","v16.6.1","v16.6.2","v16.7.0","v16.8.0","v16.9.0","v16.9.1","v18.0.0","v18.1.0","v18.10.0","v18.11.0","v18.12.0","v18.12.1","v18.13.0","v18.14.0","v18.14.1","v18.14.2","v18.15.0","v18.16.0","v18.16.1","v18.17.0","v18.2.0","v18.3.0","v18.4.0","v18.5.0","v18.6.0","v18.7.0","v18.8.0","v18.9.0","v18.9.1","v20.0.0","v20.1.0","v20.2.0","v20.3.0","v20.3.1","v20.4.0","v20.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-32559.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1946470"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0006/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
