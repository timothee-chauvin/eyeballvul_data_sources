{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-67487","published":"2025-12-09T03:35:58.257Z","modified":"2025-12-13T04:54:22.963022Z","aliases":["GHSA-459f-x8vq-xjjm"],"summary":"Static Web Server is vulnerable to symbolic link Path Traversal","details":"Static Web Server (SWS) is a production-ready web server suitable for static web files or assets. Versions 2.40.0 and below contain symbolic links (symlinks) which can be used to access files or directories outside the intended web root folder. SWS generally does not prevent symlinks from escaping the web server’s root directory. Therefore, if a malicious actor gains access to the web server’s root directory, they could create symlinks to access other files outside the designated web root folder either by URL or via the directory listing. This issue is fixed in version 2.40.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/static-web-server/static-web-server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8a930ca88e415ff6e091d208839be940577c55ce"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0-beta.2","1.0.0-beta.3","1.0.0-beta.4","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-beta.1","v2.0.0-beta.2","v2.0.0-beta.3","v2.0.0-beta.4","v2.0.0-beta.5","v2.0.0-beta.6","v2.0.0-beta.7","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.1.0","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.12.0","v2.13.0","v2.13.1","v2.14.0","v2.14.1","v2.14.2","v2.15.0","v2.16.0","v2.17.0","v2.18.0","v2.19.0","v2.2.0","v2.20.0","v2.20.1","v2.20.2","v2.21.0","v2.21.1","v2.22.0","v2.22.1","v2.23.0","v2.24.0","v2.24.1","v2.24.2","v2.25.0","v2.26.0","v2.27.0","v2.28.0","v2.3.0","v2.30.0","v2.31.0","v2.31.1","v2.32.0","v2.32.1","v2.32.2","v2.33.0","v2.33.1","v2.34.0","v2.35.0","v2.36.0","v2.36.1","v2.37.0","v2.38.0","v2.38.1","v2.39.0","v2.4.0","v2.40.0","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.6.0-beta.1","v2.6.0-beta.2","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.8.0","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67487.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67487.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/static-web-server/static-web-server/commit/308f0d26ceb9c2c8bd219315d0f53914763357f2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/static-web-server/static-web-server/security/advisories/GHSA-459f-x8vq-xjjm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67487"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-61"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67487.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
