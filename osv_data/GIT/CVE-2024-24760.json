A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions < 2024-01c. This vulnerability potentially allows attackers on the same subnet to connect to exposed ports of a Docker container, even when the port is bound to 127.0.0.1. The vulnerability has been addressed by implementing additional iptables/nftables rules. These rules drop packets for Docker containers on ports 3306, 6379, 8983, and 12345, where the input interface is not `br-mailcow` and the output interface is `br-mailcow`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8ae762a8c80ce0d12659e918257fe5dbf78118d7"}]}],"versions":["2022-01","2022-01a","2022-03","2022-03a","2022-04","2022-05","2022-05a","2022-05b","2022-05c","2022-05d","2022-06","2022-06a","2022-06b","2022-07","2022-07a","2022-08","2022-08a","2022-08b","2022-09","2022-09a","2022-10","2022-10a","2022-11","2022-11a","2022-11b","2022-12","2022-12a","2022-12b","2023-01","2023-01a","2023-02","2023-02a","2023-03","2023-04","2023-04a","2023-04b","2023-05","2023-05a","2023-07","2023-07a","2023-08","2023-09","2023-10","2023-10a","2023-11","2023-11a","2023-12","2023-12a","2024-01","2024-01a","2024-01b","2024-01c","2024-01d"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-24760.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/commit/087481ac12bfa5dd715f3630f0b1697be94f7e88"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/security/advisories/GHSA-gmpj-5xcm-xxx6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-610"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
