The wrong portion of an RFC2822 header is identified as the value of the addr-spec. In some applications, an attacker can bypass a protection mechanism in which application access is granted only after verifying receipt of e-mail to a specific domain (e.g., only @company.example.com addresses may be used for signup). This occurs in email/_parseaddr.py in recent versions of Python.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/python/cpython","events":[{"introduced":"6046c5e0298c25515ea58abc8ab87f7413e3f743"},{"fixed":"39b2f82717a69dde7212bc39b673b0f55c99e6a3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-27043.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://python.org"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4ZAEFSFZDNBNJPNOUTLG5COISGQDLMGV/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/75DTHSTNOFFNAWHXKMDXS7EJWC6W2FUC/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ARI7VDSNTQVXRQFM6IK5GSSLEIYV4VZH/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BQAKLUJMHFGVBRDPEY57BJGNCE5UUPHW/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HXYVPEZUA3465AEFX5JVFVP7KIFZMF3N/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N6M5I6OQHJABNEYY555HUMMKX3Y4P25Z/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NEUNZSZ3CVSM2QWVYH3N2XGOCDWNYUA3/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ORLXS5YTKN65E2Q2NWKXMFS5FWQHRNZW/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/P2MAICLFDDO3QVNHTZ2OCERZQ34R2PIC/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/P2W2BZQIHMCKRI5FNBJERFYMS5PK6TAH/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PHVGRKQAGANCSGFI3QMYOCIMS4IFOZA5/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PU6Y2S5CBN5BWCBDAJFTGIBZLK3S2G3J/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QDRDDPDN3VFIYXJIYEABY6USX5EU66AG/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RDDC2VOX7OQC6OHMYTVD4HLFZIV6PYBC/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SINP4OVYNB2AGDYI2GS37EMW3H3F7XPZ/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SOX7BCN6YL7B3RFPEEXPIU5CMTEHJOKR/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VZXC32CJ7TWDPJO6GY2XIQRO7JZX5FLP/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XWMBD4LNHWEXRI6YVFWJMTJQUL5WOFTS/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YQVY5C5REXWJIORJIL2FIL3ALOEJEF72/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/email-parseaddr-realname.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230601-0003/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4ZAEFSFZDNBNJPNOUTLG5COISGQDLMGV/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/75DTHSTNOFFNAWHXKMDXS7EJWC6W2FUC/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ARI7VDSNTQVXRQFM6IK5GSSLEIYV4VZH/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BQAKLUJMHFGVBRDPEY57BJGNCE5UUPHW/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HXYVPEZUA3465AEFX5JVFVP7KIFZMF3N/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N6M5I6OQHJABNEYY555HUMMKX3Y4P25Z/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NEUNZSZ3CVSM2QWVYH3N2XGOCDWNYUA3/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ORLXS5YTKN65E2Q2NWKXMFS5FWQHRNZW/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/P2MAICLFDDO3QVNHTZ2OCERZQ3
