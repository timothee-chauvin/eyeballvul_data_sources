{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-36027","published":"2024-05-30T15:10:17Z","modified":"2025-10-21T21:44:30.458048Z","summary":"btrfs: zoned: do not flag ZEROOUT on non-dirty extent buffer","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: zoned: do not flag ZEROOUT on non-dirty extent buffer\n\nBtrfs clears the content of an extent buffer marked as\nEXTENT_BUFFER_ZONED_ZEROOUT before the bio submission. This mechanism is\nintroduced to prevent a write hole of an extent buffer, which is once\nallocated, marked dirty, but turns out unnecessary and cleaned up within\none transaction operation.\n\nCurrently, btrfs_clear_buffer_dirty() marks the extent buffer as\nEXTENT_BUFFER_ZONED_ZEROOUT, and skips the entry function. If this call\nhappens while the buffer is under IO (with the WRITEBACK flag set,\nwithout the DIRTY flag), we can add the ZEROOUT flag and clear the\nbuffer's content just before a bio submission. As a result:\n\n1) it can lead to adding faulty delayed reference item which leads to a\n   FS corrupted (EUCLEAN) error, and\n\n2) it writes out cleared tree node on disk\n\nThe former issue is previously discussed in [1]. The corruption happens\nwhen it runs a delayed reference update. So, on-disk data is safe.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/3f4f2a0ff1a6c818050434288925bdcf3cd719e5.1709124777.git.naohiro.aota@wdc.com/\n\nThe latter one can reach on-disk data. But, as that node is already\nprocessed by btrfs_clear_buffer_dirty(), that will be invalidated in the\nnext transaction commit anyway. So, the chance of hitting the corruption\nis relatively small.\n\nAnyway, we should skip flagging ZEROOUT on a non-DIRTY extent buffer, to\nkeep the content under IO intact.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"aa6313e6ff2bfbf736a2739047bba355d8241584"},{"fixed":"f4b994fccbb6f294c4b31a6ca0114b09f7245043"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"aa6313e6ff2bfbf736a2739047bba355d8241584"},{"fixed":"68879386180c0efd5a11e800b0525a01068c9457"}]}],"versions":["v6.7","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.8.1","v6.8.2","v6.8.3","v6.8.4","v6.8.5","v6.8.6","v6.8.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-36027.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.8.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-36027.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/68879386180c0efd5a11e800b0525a01068c9457"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f4b994fccbb6f294c4b31a6ca0114b09f7245043"}]}
