This occurs because the server allocates memory for the command arguments of every bulk, even when the command is skipped because of insufficient permissions. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because abuse of the commands network protocol is not a violation of the Redis Security Model.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/redis/redis","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"b49d5c0cf4e96a277d4b4e98f61d10c792b37003"}]}],"versions":["1.3.6","2.2-alpha0","2.2-alpha1","2.2-alpha2","2.2-alpha3","2.2-alpha4","2.2-alpha5","2.2-alpha6","2.2.0-rc1","2.3-alpha0","3.0-alpha0","8.0-m01","8.0-m02","8.0-m03","8.0-m04","8.0-m04-int","8.0-rc1","8.0-rc1-int","8.0-rc1-int2","8.0-rc2-int","8.0.0","8.0.1","8.0.1-int","8.0.2","8.0.3","v1.3.10","v1.3.11","v1.3.12","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v2.0.0-rc1","v2.1.1-watch","vm-playpen","with-deprecated-diskstore"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-46686.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-2r7g-8hpc-rpq9"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/io-no/CVE-Reports/issues/1"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/redis/redis"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
