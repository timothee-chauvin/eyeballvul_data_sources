In affected versions clients could clobber values set by intermediate proxies (such as X-Forwarded-For) by providing a underscore version of the same header (X-Forwarded_For). Any users relying on proxy set variables is affected. v6.4.3/v5.6.9 now discards any headers using underscores if the non-underscore version also exists. Effectively, allowing the proxy defined headers to always win. Users are advised to upgrade. Nginx has a underscores_in_headers configuration variable to discard these headers at the proxy level as a mitigation. Any users that are implicitly trusting the proxy defined headers for security should immediately cease doing so until upgraded to the fixed versions.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/puma/puma","events":[{"introduced":"32d999708d7019b85b0518c8e0693773b0bd4ff4"},{"fixed":"e867e53aa4e7df91fa97d8995a80fc2f9466a080"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/puma/puma","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f196b23be24712fb8fb16051cc124798cc84f70e"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.6.9"}]}}],"versions":["rm","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.2","v2.0.0","v2.0.0.b2","v2.0.0.b3","v2.0.0.b4","v2.0.0.b5","v2.0.0.b6","v2.0.0.b7","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.10.2","v2.11.0","v2.11.2","v2.11.3","v2.12.0","v2.12.1","v2.12.2","v2.12.3","v2.13.0","v2.13.1","v2.13.2","v2.13.3","v2.13.4","v2.14.0","v2.15.0","v2.15.1","v2.15.2","v2.15.3","v2.16.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v2.9.2","v3.0.0","v3.0.0.rc1","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.10.0","v3.11.0","v3.11.1","v3.11.2","v3.11.3","v3.11.4","v3.12.0","v3.12.1","v3.2.0","v3.3.0","v3.4.0","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.6.0","v3.7.1","v3.8.0","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.1.0","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.3.0","v5.0.0","v5.0.0.beta1","v5.0.0.beta2","v5.0.1","v5.0.2","v5.0.3","v5.1.0","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.2.2","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.4.0","v5.5.0","v5.5.1","v5.5.2","v5.6.0","v5.6.1","v5.6.2","v5.6.4","v5.6.5","v5.6.6","v5.6.7","v5.6.8","v6.0.0","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.1.0","v6.2.0","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.3.0","v6.4.0","v6.4.1","v6.4.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45614.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["232977267776323730279055942466391420493","23119890018860005825266378863797224565","200787430779553903926757555396896340908","111087665460754029894027671599367963389"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2024-45614-3e545615","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/puma/puma/commit/f196b23be24712fb8fb16051cc124798cc84f70e","target":{"file":"ext/puma_http11/org/jruby/puma/Http11.java"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"159998391064100209205141949366143445508","length":1234},"id":"CVE-2024-45614-9ed0cd80","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/puma/puma/commit/f196b23be24712fb8fb16051cc124798cc84f70e","target":{"file":"ext/puma_http11/org/jruby/puma/Http11.java","function":"http_field"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-9hf4-67fc-4vf4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00004.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#underscores_in_headers"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-639"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
