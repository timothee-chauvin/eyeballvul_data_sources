An authenticated attacker with access to the admin panel could abuse this to: (1) fully map the filesystem structure via the /api/file_manager/files?base_folder= endpoint, (2) create arbitrary directories on the server via the /api/file_manager/directories endpoint, (3) read arbitrary files from the server by copying the file to a readable location within the application via the /api/file_manager/copy_files endpoint, {4) delete arbitrary files from the server via a DELETE request to /api/file_manager/files, or (5) create arbitrary files on the server by uploading them and then leveraging the /api/file_manager/move_files endpoint to move them anywhere in the filesystem.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/innocommerce/innoshop","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"6e1c6cc37950d2c00b0e3c948b5cd332e8db933d"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.6","v0.2.8","v0.3.0","v0.3.10","v0.3.2","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.3.8","v0.3.9","v0.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52922.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/innocommerce/innoshop"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://medium.com/@The_Hiker/how-i-found-multiple-cves-in-innoshop-0-4-1-12c8f84ad87f"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
