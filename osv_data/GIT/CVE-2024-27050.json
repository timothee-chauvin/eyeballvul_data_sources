For consistency, this\nfix just changes the assignments to both fields to use the OPTS_SET()\nmacro.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"13ce2daa259a3bfbc9a5aeeee8b9a87058703731"},{"fixed":"fa5bef5e80c6a3321b2b1a7070436f3bc5daf07c"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"13ce2daa259a3bfbc9a5aeeee8b9a87058703731"},{"fixed":"682ddd62abd4bdcee7584246903e7a2df005fe0d"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"13ce2daa259a3bfbc9a5aeeee8b9a87058703731"},{"fixed":"cd3be9843247edb8fc6fcd8d8237cbce2bc19f5e"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"13ce2daa259a3bfbc9a5aeeee8b9a87058703731"},{"fixed":"92a871ab9fa59a74d013bc04f321026a057618e7"}]}],"versions":["v6.5","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.3","v6.6.4","v6.6.5","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.7.1","v6.7.10","v6.7.2","v6.7.3","v6.7.4","v6.7.5","v6.7.6","v6.7.7","v6.7.8","v6.7.9","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-27050.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.6.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.23"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.7.11"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.8.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-27050.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/682ddd62abd4bdcee7584246903e7a2df005fe0d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/92a871ab9fa59a74d013bc04f321026a057618e7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cd3be9843247edb8fc6fcd8d8237cbce2bc19f5e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fa5bef5e80c6a3321b2b1a7070436f3bc5daf07c"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
