{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-7396","published":"2025-07-18T23:15:23.797Z","modified":"2025-12-05T12:32:35.527572Z","details":"In wolfSSL release 5.8.2 blinding support is turned on by default for Curve25519 in applicable builds. The blinding configure option is only for the base C implementation of Curve25519. It is not needed, or available with; ARM assembly builds, Intel assembly builds, and the small Curve25519 feature. While the side-channel attack on extracting a private key would be very difficult to execute in practice, enabling blinding provides an additional layer of protection for devices that may be more susceptible to physical access or side-channel observation.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"decea12e223869c8f8f3ab5a53dc90b69f436eb2"}]}],"versions":["WCv4-rng-stable","WCv4-stable","WCv4.0-RC5","WCv4.0-RC6","WCv4.0-RC8","WCv4.0-RC9","WCv5.0-RC10","WCv5.0-RC11","WCv5.0-RC12","WCv5.0-RC9","WCv5.2.1-PILOT","l","list","v0.5","v1.8.8.0","v1.9.0","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.6","v2.0.8","v2.0rc1","v2.0rc2","v2.0rc2b","v2.0rc3","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.4","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.4.2","v2.4.6","v2.4.7","v2.5.0","v2.5.2","v2.5.2b","v2.6.0","v2.6.2","v2.7.0","v2.7.2","v2.8.0","v2.8.2","v2.8.3","v2.8.4","v2.8.5","v2.8.5a","v2.8.6","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v2.9.2","v2.9.4","v3.0.0","v3.0.2","v3.1.0","v3.10.0-stable","v3.10.0a","v3.10.2-stable","v3.10.3","v3.10.4","v3.11.0-stable","v3.11.1-tls13-beta","v3.12.0-stable","v3.12.2-stable","v3.13.0-stable","v3.13.2","v3.13.3","v3.14.0-stable","v3.14.0a","v3.14.0b","v3.14.2","v3.14.4","v3.14.5","v3.15.0-stable","v3.15.3-stable","v3.15.5-stable","v3.15.5a","v3.15.6","v3.15.7-stable","v3.15.8","v3.2.0","v3.2.4","v3.2.6","v3.3.0","v3.3.3","v3.4.0","v3.4.2","v3.4.6","v3.4.8","v3.6.0","v3.6.0b","v3.6.2","v3.6.6","v3.6.8","v3.6.9","v3.6.9b","v3.6.9c","v3.6.9d","v3.69.d","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.7.3","v3.8.0","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v3.9.10-stable","v3.9.10b","v3.9.6","v3.9.6w","v3.9.8","v4.0.0-stable","v4.1.0-stable","v4.2.0-stable","v4.2.0c","v4.3.0-stable","v4.4.0-stable","v4.5.0-stable","v4.6.0-stable","v4.7.0-stable","v4.7.1r","v4.8.0-stable","v5.0.0-stable","v5.1.0-stable","v5.2.0-stable","v5.2.1","v5.3.0-stable","v5.4.0-stable","v5.5.0-stable","v5.5.1-stable","v5.5.2-stable","v5.5.3-stable","v5.5.4-stable","v5.6.0-stable","v5.6.2-stable","v5.6.3-stable","v5.6.4-stable","v5.6.6-stable","v5.7.0-stable","v5.7.2-stable","v5.7.4-stable","v5.7.6-stable","v5.8.0-stable","v5.8.2-stable","wolfEntropy1","wolfRand-RC2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-7396.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#wolfssl-release-582-july-17-2025"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
