  "details": "An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists in the `upload-link` endpoint of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) by shutting down the server through sending invalid upload requests. Specifically, the server can be made to shut down by sending an empty body with a 'Content-Length: 0' header or by sending a body with arbitrary content, such as 'asdasdasd', with a 'Content-Length: 9' header. The vulnerability is reproducible by users with at least a 'Manager' role, sending a crafted request to any workspace. This issue indicates that a previous fix was not effective in mitigating the vulnerability.",
