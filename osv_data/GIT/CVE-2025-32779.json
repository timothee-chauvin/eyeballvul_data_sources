In versions before 5.5.0, an attacker with access to the `/backup/import` API endpoint can write arbitrary files to locations outside the intended extraction directory due to a Zip Slip vulnerability. Although the application runs as a non-root user (`185`), limiting direct impact on system-level files, this vulnerability can still be exploited to overwrite application files (e.g., JAR libraries) owned by the application user. This overwrite can potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the application's context. This issue has been patched in version 5.5.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/labsai/eddi","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f14dcafff8141ac73f24c5bd706a11764b78d4da"}]}],"versions":["4.4.1","4.5.0","dev-4.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-32779.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/labsai/EDDI/security/advisories/GHSA-9v34-frgq-63mv"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/code-security-for-conversational-ai-uncovering-a-zip-slip-in-eddi"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/labsai/EDDI/commit/1e207d0e4f72a5a93920bc0f76cad53ffd8e7065"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
