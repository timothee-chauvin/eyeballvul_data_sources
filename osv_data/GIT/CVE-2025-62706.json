Prior to version 1.6.5, Authlibâ€™s JWE zip=DEF path performs unbounded DEFLATE decompression. A very small ciphertext can expand into tens or hundreds of megabytes on decrypt, allowing an attacker who can supply decryptable tokens to exhaust memory and CPU and cause denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.5. Workarounds for this issue involve rejecting or stripping zip=DEF for inbound JWEs at the application boundary, forking and add a bounded decompression guard via decompressobj().decompress(data, MAX_SIZE)) and returning an error when output exceeds a safe limit, or enforcing strict maximum token sizes and fail fast on oversized inputs; combine with rate limiting.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/authlib/authlib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e0863d5129316b1790eee5f14cece32a03b8184d"}]}],"versions":["v0.1","v0.10","v0.11","v0.12","v0.13","v0.14","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.15","v0.15.1","v0.2","v0.2.1","v0.3","v0.4","v0.4.1","v0.5","v0.5.1","v0.6","v0.7","v0.8","v0.9","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62706.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/authlib/authlib/security/advisories/GHSA-g7f3-828f-7h7m"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/authlib/authlib/commit/e0863d5129316b1790eee5f14cece32a03b8184d"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400","CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
