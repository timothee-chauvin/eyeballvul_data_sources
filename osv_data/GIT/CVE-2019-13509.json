This applies to a scenario where docker stack deploy is run to redeploy a stack that includes (non external) secrets. It potentially applies to other API users of the stack API if they resend the secret.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/docker/docker-ce","events":[{"introduced":"4d60db472b2bde6931072ca6467f2667c2590dff"},{"fixed":"0dd43dd87fd530113bf44c9bba9ad8b20ce4637f"}]}],"versions":["v18.09.0","v18.09.1","v18.09.1-beta1","v18.09.1-beta2","v18.09.1-rc1","v18.09.2","v18.09.3","v18.09.3-rc1","v18.09.4","v18.09.4-rc1","v18.09.5","v18.09.5-rc1","v18.09.6","v18.09.6-rc1","v18.09.7","v18.09.7-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-13509.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/docker/docker","events":[{"introduced":"f5749085e9cb0565afe342e73a67631f97547054"},{"fixed":"456712c5b8d9d92c047f6a7d7cff270527ecac28"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-13509.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/109253"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190828-0003/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4521"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-08/msg00084.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N674WD3OBDPHLWY6EABRHQH5ON6SUJBU/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PFFBVE7O73TAVY2BCWXSA2OOSLJVCPXC/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Sep/21"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
