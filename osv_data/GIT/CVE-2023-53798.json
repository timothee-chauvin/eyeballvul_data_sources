{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53798","published":"2025-12-09T00:00:54.769Z","modified":"2025-12-09T03:46:29.566823Z","summary":"ethtool: Fix uninitialized number of lanes","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nethtool: Fix uninitialized number of lanes\n\nIt is not possible to set the number of lanes when setting link modes\nusing the legacy IOCTL ethtool interface. Since 'struct\nethtool_link_ksettings' is not initialized in this path, drivers receive\nan uninitialized number of lanes in 'struct\nethtool_link_ksettings::lanes'.\n\nWhen this information is later queried from drivers, it results in the\nethtool code making decisions based on uninitialized memory, leading to\nthe following KMSAN splat [1]. In practice, this most likely only\nhappens with the tun driver that simply returns whatever it got in the\nset operation.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this uninitialized memory is not leaked to user\nspace thanks to the 'ethtool_ops->cap_link_lanes_supported' check in\nlinkmodes_prepare_data().\n\nFix by initializing the structure in the IOCTL path. Did not find any\nmore call sites that pass an uninitialized structure when calling\n'ethtool_ops::set_link_ksettings()'.\n\n[1]\nBUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in ethnl_update_linkmodes
