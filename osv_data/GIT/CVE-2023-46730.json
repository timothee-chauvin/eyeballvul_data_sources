{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-46730","published":"2023-11-07T17:35:36Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:15:12.470226Z","aliases":["GHSA-vw6c-h82w-mvfv"],"summary":"Server-Side Request Forgery in groupoffice ","details":"Group-Office is an enterprise CRM and groupware tool. In affected versions there is full Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the /api/upload.php endpoint. The /api/upload.php endpoint does not filter URLs which allows a malicious user to cause the server to make resource requests to untrusted domains. Note that protocols like file:// can also be used to access the server disk. The request result (on success) can then be retrieved using /api/download.php. This issue has been addressed in versions 6.8.15, 6.7.54, and 6.6.177. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/intermesh/groupoffice","events":[{"introduced":"b7193441ed2550ce7bfb4fd5c3471fbb5ebb9eb8"},{"fixed":"40cedb30edb932d17446e9a8694c1b29f5027ff6"}]}],"versions":["v6.6.131","v6.6.132","v6.6.133","v6.6.134","v6.6.135","v6.6.136","v6.6.137","v6.6.138","v6.6.139","v6.6.140","v6.6.141","v6.6.142","v6.6.143","v6.6.144","v6.6.145","v6.6.146","v6.6.147","v6.6.148","v6.6.149","v6.6.150","v6.6.151","v6.6.152","v6.6.153","v6.6.154","v6.6.155","v6.6.156","v6.6.157","v6.6.158","v6.6.159","v6.6.160","v6.6.161","v6.6.162","v6.6.163","v6.6.164","v6.6.165","v6.6.166","v6.6.167","v6.6.168","v6.6.169","v6.6.170","v6.6.171","v6.6.172","v6.6.173","v6.6.174","v6.6.175","v6.6.176","v6.7.0","v6.7.1","v6.7.10","v6.7.11","v6.7.12","v6.7.13","v6.7.14","v6.7.15","v6.7.16","v6.7.17","v6.7.18","v6.7.19","v6.7.2","v6.7.20","v6.7.22","v6.7.23","v6.7.24","v6.7.25","v6.7.26","v6.7.27","v6.7.28","v6.7.29","v6.7.3","v6.7.30","v6.7.31","v6.7.32","v6.7.33","v6.7.34","v6.7.35","v6.7.36","v6.7.37","v6.7.38","v6.7.39","v6.7.40","v6.7.41","v6.7.42","v6.7.43","v6.7.45","v6.7.46","v6.7.47","v6.7.48","v6.7.49","v6.7.5","v6.7.50","v6.7.51","v6.7.52","v6.7.53","v6.7.6","v6.7.7","v6.7.8","v6.7.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-46730.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/commit/99205535e8cec6592fd7f1469837926f27c72d50"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/security/advisories/GHSA-vw6c-h82w-mvfv"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
