{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-7066","published":"2025-07-04T12:02:34.287Z","modified":"2025-11-20T10:09:36.995103Z","summary":"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') in Jirafeau","details":"Jirafeau normally prevents browser preview for text files due to the possibility that for example SVG and HTML documents could be exploited for cross site scripting. This was done by storing the MIME type of a file and allowing only browser preview for MIME types beginning with image (except for image/svg+xml, see CVE-2022-30110 and CVE-2024-12326), video and audio. However, it was possible to bypass this check by sending a manipulated MIME type containing a comma and an other MIME type like text/html (for example image/png,text/html). Browsers see multiple MIME types and text/html would takes precedence, allowing a possible attacker to do a cross-site scripting attack. The check for MIME types was enhanced to prevent a browser preview when the stored MIME type contains a comma.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.com/jirafeau/jirafeau","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"28ccf13d58e5b5d3e295215f7d28901cb65c127e"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.6.3"}]}}],"versions":["1.0","1.1","1.2.0","2.0.0","3.0.0","3.1.0","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.3.0","3.4.0","3.4.1","4.0.0","4.1.0","4.1.1","4.2.0","4.3.0","4.4.0","4.5.0","4.6.0","4.6.1","4.6.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-7066.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://gitlab.com/jirafeau/Jirafeau/-/commit/79464ec6276e8eb0e0b0ad597db02b85080d2b63"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30110"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12326"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
