When a scan is initiated\non such P2P vifs, driver selects destination radio (ar) based on scan\nfrequency, creates a scan vdev, and attaches arvif to the radio. Once the\nscan completes or is aborted, the scan vdev is deleted, detaching arvif\nfrom the radio and leaving arvif->ar uninitialized.\n\nWhile handling beacon miss for station interfaces, P2P interface is also\nencountered in the vif iteration and ath12k_mac_handle_beacon_miss_iter()\ntries to dereference the uninitialized arvif->deflink->ar.\n\nFix this by verifying that vdev is created for the arvif before accessing\nits ar during beacon miss handling and similar vif iterator callbacks.\n\n==========================================================================\n wlp6s0: detected beacon loss from AP (missed 7 beacons) - probing\n KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000010-0x0000000000000017]\n\n CPU: 5 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/5 Not tainted 6.16.0-rc1-wt-ath+ #2 PREEMPT(full)\n RIP: 0010:ath12k_mac_handle_beacon_miss_iter+0xb5/0x1a0 [ath12k]\n Call Trace:\n  __iterate_interfaces+0x11a/0x410 [mac80211]\n  ieee80211_iterate_active_interfaces_atomic+0x61/0x140 [mac80211]\n  ath12k_mac_handle_beacon_miss+0xa1/0xf0 [ath12k]\n  ath12k_roam_event+0x393/0x560 [ath12k]\n  ath12k_wmi_op_rx+0x1486/0x28c0 [ath12k]\n  ath12k_htc_process_trailer.isra.0+0x2fb/0x620 [ath12k]\n  ath12k_htc_rx_completion_handler+0x448/0x830 [ath12k]\n  ath12k_ce_recv_process_cb+0x549/0x9e0 [ath12k]\n  ath12k_ce_per_engine_service+0xbe/0xf0 [ath12k]\n  ath12k_pci_ce_workqueue+0x69/0x120 [ath12k]\n  process_one_work+0xe3a/0x1430\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.4.1-00199-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1\nTested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.1.c5-00284.1-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"aa80f12f3bedc2d73e4cc43554aee44c277cc938"},{"fixed":"9b861dfc5c07defd0191fd3e7288a3179cd9a02e"},{"fixed":"1259b6da8303f70fef6ed4aef8ae3dedfecb0f27"},{"fixed":"36670b67de18f1e5d34900c5d2ac60a8970c293c"}]}],"versions":["v6.12","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.15.1","v6.15.2","v6.15.3","v6.15.4","v6.15.5","v6.15.6","v6.15.7","v6.15.8","v6.15.9","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38606.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.14.0"},{"fixed":"6.15.10"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38606.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1259b6da8303f70fef6ed4aef8ae3dedfecb0f27"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/36670b67de18f1e5d34900c5d2ac60a8970c293c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9b861dfc5c07defd0191fd3e7288a3179cd9a02e"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/38xxx/CVE-2025-38606.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38606"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/38xxx/CVE-2025-38606.json"}}
