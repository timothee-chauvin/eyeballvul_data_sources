Prior to versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9, it is possible for a user with access to the SQL Manager (Advanced Options -> Database) to arbitrarily read any file on the operating system when using SQL function `LOAD_FILE` in a `SELECT` request. This gives the user access to critical information. A patch is available in PrestaShop 8.0.4 and PS 1.7.8.9\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/prestashop/prestashop","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"49d43b5fa0140304e64b530a5367cb30785eb15d"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.7.8.9"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/prestashop/prestashop","events":[{"introduced":"ca9d81aae0bb17f3e767bb5d835348ed144a3ab5"},{"fixed":"95d94dabaf40ba63be737b4a9cdbac328e66e5f9"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"8.0.0"},{"fixed":"8.0.4"}]}}],"versions":["1.5.3.0","1.5.4.1","1.5.6.0","1.5.6.1","1.5.6.2","1.6.0.1","1.6.0.11","1.6.0.12","1.6.0.13","1.6.0.14","1.6.0.2","1.6.0.3","1.6.0.4","1.6.0.5","1.6.0.6","1.6.0.7","1.6.0.8","1.6.0.9","1.6.1.0","1.6.1.1","1.6.1.2-RC3","1.7.0.0","1.7.0.0-beta.1.0","1.7.0.0-beta.2.0","1.7.0.0-beta.3.0","1.7.0.0-beta.4.0","1.7.0.0-rc.0.0","1.7.0.1","1.7.0.2","1.7.0.3","1.7.0.4","1.7.0.5","1.7.0.6","1.7.1.0","1.7.1.1","1.7.1.2","1.7.2.0","1.7.2.0-rc.1.0","1.7.2.1","1.7.2.2","1.7.2.3","1.7.2.4","1.7.3.0","1.7.3.1","1.7.3.2","1.7.3.3","1.7.3.4","1.7.4.0","1.7.4.1","1.7.4.2","1.7.4.3","1.7.5.0","1.7.5.0-rc.1","1.7.5.1","1.7.6.0","1.7.6.0-beta.1","1.7.6.0-rc.1","1.7.6.0-rc.2","1.7.6.1","1.7.6.2","1.7.6.3","1.7.6.4","1.7.6.5","1.7.6.6","1.7.6.7","1.7.6.8","1.7.6.9","1.7.7.0","1.7.7.0-beta.1","1.7.7.0-beta.2","1.7.7.0-rc.1","1.7.7.1","1.7.7.2","1.7.7.3","1.7.7.4","1.7.7.5","1.7.7.6","1.7.7.7","1.7.7.8","1.7.8.0","1.7.8.0-beta.1","1.7.8.0-rc.1","1.7.8.1","1.7.8.2","1.7.8.3","1.7.8.4","1.7.8.5","1.7.8.6","1.7.8.7","1.7.8.8","8.0.0","8.0.1","8.0.2","8.0.3","show"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-30545.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/30xxx/CVE-2023-30545.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/cddac4198a47c602878a787280d813f60c6c0630"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/d900806e1841a31f26ff0a1843a6888fc1bb7f81"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-8r4m-5p6p-52rp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30545"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-89"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/30xxx/CVE-2023-30545.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
