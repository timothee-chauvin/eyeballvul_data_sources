{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-43378","published":"2024-08-15T23:53:07.103Z","modified":"2025-12-05T05:58:56.603557Z","related":["GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww","GHSA-vfxf-gpmj-2p25"],"summary":"calamares-nixos-extensions LUKS keyfile exposure regression on legacy BIOS systems","details":"calamares-nixos-extensions provides Calamares branding and modules for NixOS, a distribution of GNU/Linux. Users who installed NixOS through the graphical installer who used manual disk partitioning to create a setup where the system was booted via legacy BIOS rather than UEFI; some disk partitions are encrypted; but the partitions containing either `/` or `/boot` are unencrypted; have their LUKS disk encryption key file in plain text either in `/crypto_keyfile.bin`, or in a CPIO archive attached to their NixOS initrd. `nixos-install` is not affected, nor are UEFI installations, nor was the default automatic partitioning configuration on legacy BIOS systems. The problem has been fixed in calamares-nixos-extensions 0.3.17, which was included in NixOS. The current installer images for the NixOS 24.05 and unstable (24.11) channels are unaffected. The fix reached 24.05 at 2024-08-13 20:06:59 UTC, and unstable at 2024-08-15 09:00:20 UTC. Installer images downloaded before those times may be vulnerable. The best solution for affected users is probably to back up their data and do a complete reinstallation. However, the mitigation procedure in GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww should work solely for the case where `/` is encrypted but `/boot` is not. If `/` is unencrypted, then the `/crypto_keyfile.bin` file will need to be deleted in addition to the remediation steps in the previous advisory. This issue is a partial regression of CVE-2023-36476 / GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww, which was more severe as it applied to the default configuration on BIOS systems.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nixos/calamares-nixos-extensions","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9dccb64cf9a3c1cf1d78f3ca9fdad7a004d9430b"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.3.17"}]}}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2","0.0.3","0.1.0","0.1.1","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.2","0.2.3","0.2.4","0.2.5","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.10","0.3.11","0.3.12","0.3.13","0.3.14","0.3.15","0.3.16","0.3.2","0.3.3","0.3.4","0.3.5","0.3.6","0.3.7","0.3.8","0.3.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-43378.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/43xxx/CVE-2024-43378.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions/pull/43"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-vfxf-gpmj-2p25"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/331607"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/334252"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43378"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-256"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/43xxx/CVE-2024-43378.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
