To respond to the probe deferral return, the CLK_DMA clock\nwas disabled, and this led to parent clocks also reducing their enable\ncount.  When the enable count for pll1_d8 was decremented it became 0,\nwhich caused it to be disabled.  This led to a system hang.\n\nMarking that clock critical resolves this by preventing it from being\ndisabled.\n\nDefine a new macro CCU_FACTOR_GATE_DEFINE() to allow clock flags to\nbe supplied for a CCU_FACTOR_GATE clock.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"1b72c59db0add8e47fa116b21f78ed0b09a264f3"},{"fixed":"10948c00e548e9ad2ce9d765baf26dce2d9b806b"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"1b72c59db0add8e47fa116b21f78ed0b09a264f3"},{"fixed":"7554729de27daf6d54bcf8689d863bbe267828bf"}]}],"versions":["v6.15","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38633.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38633.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10948c00e548e9ad2ce9d765baf26dce2d9b806b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7554729de27daf6d54bcf8689d863bbe267828bf"}]}
