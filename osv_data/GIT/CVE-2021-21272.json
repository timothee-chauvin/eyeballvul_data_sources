ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/deislabs/oras","events":[{"introduced":"9f7669048990b0d0c186985737e6a6c3bb3f7ecc"},{"fixed":"96cd90423303f1bb42bd043cb4c36085e6e91e8e"}]}],"versions":["v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-21272.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oras-project/oras","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"96cd90423303f1bb42bd043cb4c36085e6e91e8e"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-21272.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/deislabs/oras/releases/tag/v0.9.0"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/deislabs/oras/security/advisories/GHSA-g5v4-5x39-vwhx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/oras"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/deislabs/oras/commit/96cd90423303f1bb42bd043cb4c36085e6e91e8e"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
