The package includes an `ALLOW_LIST` where the host can specify which services the user is permitted to capture screenshots of. By default, capturing screenshots of web services running on localhost, 127.0.0.1, or the [::] is allowed. If someone hosts this project on a server, users could then capture screenshots of other web services running locally. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.1 with the addition of a blocklist. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ef8391480c25332fc74d6cf841eab2969e18db27"}]}],"versions":["0.10.0","0.10.1","0.11.0","0.11.1","0.11.2","0.12.0","0.12.0-rc1","0.12.0-rc2","0.12.1","0.12.2","0.9.0","v0.12.3","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.1-rc.0","v1.3.1-rc.1","v1.3.1-rc.2","v1.3.2","v1.3.2-rc.0","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.5.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-39919.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/39xxx/CVE-2024-39919.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/commit/f62ff40403ffa1781459d6be8d97b8035888c00c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/security/advisories/GHSA-342q-2mc2-5gmp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39919"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/39xxx/CVE-2024-39919.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
