{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-41317","published":"2023-09-05T18:31:43Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:40:19.013397Z","aliases":["GHSA-w8vq-3hf9-xppx"],"summary":"Unnamed \"Subscription\" operation results in Denial-of-Service in apollographql/router","details":"The Apollo Router is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. Affected versions are subject to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) type vulnerability which causes the Router to panic and terminate when GraphQL Subscriptions are enabled.  It can be triggered when **all of the following conditions are met**: 1. Running Apollo Router v1.28.0, v1.28.1 or v1.29.0 (\"impacted versions\"); **and** 2. The Supergraph schema provided to the Router (either via Apollo Uplink or explicitly via other configuration) **has a `subscription` type** with root-fields defined; **and** 3. The YAML configuration provided to the Router **has subscriptions enabled** (they are _disabled_ by default), either by setting `enabled: true` _or_ by setting a valid `mode` within the `subscriptions` object (as seen in [subscriptions' documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/#router-setup)); **and** 4. An [anonymous](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Anonymous-Operation-Definitions) (i.e., un-named) `subscription` operation (e.g., `subscription { ... }`) is received by the Router If **all four** of these criteria are met, the impacted versions will panic and terminate.  There is no data-privacy risk or sensitive-information exposure aspect to this vulnerability. This is fixed in Apollo Router v1.29.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Updating to v1.29.1 should be a clear and simple upgrade path for those running impacted versions.  However, if Subscriptions are **not** necessary for your Graph – but are enabled via configuration — then disabling subscriptions is another option to mitigate the risk.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apollographql/router","events":[{"introduced":"05a53da5c308dd1c2fe25caf600f39ed37cc3971"},{"fixed":"891d41e9ea8f7f5817bdb1735cd602e12e8946ba"}]}],"versions":["v1.28.0","v1.28.1","v1.29.0","v1.29.0-rc.0","v1.29.0-rc.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-41317.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-w8vq-3hf9-xppx"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/b295c103dd86c57c848397d32e8094edfa8502aa"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.29.1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-755"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
