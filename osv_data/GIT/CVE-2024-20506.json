An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if they replace the ClamD log file with a symlink to a critical system file and then find a way to restart the ClamD process. An exploit could allow the attacker to corrupt a critical system file by appending ClamD log messages after restart.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cisco-talos/clamav","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"93d9e734200ad2eec6d1af6d52e0a4b7a7ae5d26"}]}],"versions":["clamav-0.101.0","clamav-0.102.0","clamav-0.103.0","clamav-0.103.0-rc","clamav-0.103.0-rc2","clamav-0.103.1","clamav-0.103.10","clamav-0.103.11","clamav-0.103.2","clamav-0.103.3","clamav-0.103.4","clamav-0.103.5","clamav-0.103.6","clamav-0.103.7","clamav-0.103.8","clamav-0.103.9","clamav-0.96","clamav-0.96.2","clamav-0.96.3","clamav-0.96.4","clamav-0.96.5","clamav-0.96rc1","clamav-0.96rc2","clamav-0.97","clamav-0.97rc","clamav-0.98-dmgxar","clamav-0.99-beta1","merge-llvm-79908","merge-llvm-80601","merge-llvm-83242","merge-llvm-90002","merge-llvm-91214","merge-llvm-91428","merge-llvm-92222","merge-llvm-94539","merge-llvm-97877","r5076"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-20506.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/12/msg00004.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://blog.clamav.net/2024/09/clamav-141-132-107-and-010312-security.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H"}]}
