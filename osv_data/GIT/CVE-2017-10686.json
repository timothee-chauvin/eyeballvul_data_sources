The related heap is allocated in the token() function and freed in the detoken() function (called by pp_getline()) - it is used again at multiple positions later that could cause multiple damages. For example, it causes a corrupted double-linked list in detoken(), a double free or corruption in delete_Token(), and an out-of-bounds write in detoken(). It has a high possibility to lead to a remote code execution attack.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"7a81ead31b40392e9b0dff811ac0d3d4653ccfef"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-10686.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://bugzilla.nasm.us/show_bug.cgi?id=3392414"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-19"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3694-1/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
