Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.5.48 ELTS, 10.4.45 ELTS, 11.5.37 LTS, 12.4.15 LTS, and 13.1.1, failing to properly encode user-controlled values in file entities, the `ShowImageController` (`_eID tx_cms_showpic_`) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account with access to file entities. TYPO3 versions 9.5.48 ELTS, 10.4.45 ELTS, 11.5.37 LTS, 12.4.15 LTS, 13.1.1 fix the problem described.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/typo3/typo3","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"376474904f6b9a54dc1b785a2e45277cbd13b0d7"},{"fixed":"b31d05d1da3eeaeead2d19eb43b1c3f9c88e15ee"},{"fixed":"d774642381354d3bf5095a5a26e18acd2767f0b1"}]}],"versions":["6.2.0","6.2.1","6.2.2","6.2.3","7.0.0","7.1.0","7.2.0","7.3.0","7.4.0","7.5.0","7.6.0","7.6.1","7.6.2","8.0.0","8.1.0","8.2.0","8.3.0","8.4.0","8.5.0","8.6.0","8.7.0","TYPO3_6-1-0rc1","TYPO3_6-2-0","TYPO3_6-2-0alpha1","TYPO3_6-2-0alpha2","TYPO3_6-2-0alpha3","TYPO3_6-2-0beta1","TYPO3_6-2-0beta2","TYPO3_6-2-0beta3","TYPO3_6-2-0beta4","TYPO3_6-2-0beta5","TYPO3_6-2-0beta6","TYPO3_6-2-0beta7","TYPO3_6-2-0rc1","TYPO3_6-2-0rc2","TYPO3_6-2-1","TYPO3_6-2-2","TYPO3_6-2-3","TYPO3_7-0-0","TYPO3_7-1-0","TYPO3_7-2-0","TYPO3_7-3-0","TYPO3_7-4-0","TYPO3_7-5-0","TYPO3_7-6-0","TYPO3_7-6-1","TYPO3_7-6-2","TYPO3_8-0-0","TYPO3_8-1-0","TYPO3_8-2-0","TYPO3_8-3-0","TYPO3_8-4-0","TYPO3_8-5-0","TYPO3_8-6-0","TYPO3_8-7-0","v10.0.0","v10.1.0","v10.2.0","v10.3.0","v10.4.0","v10.4.1","v10.4.2","v10.4.3","v11.0.0","v11.1.0","v11.2.0","v11.3.0","v11.4.0","v11.5.0","v11.5.1","v11.5.10","v11.5.11","v11.5.12","v11.5.13","v11.5.14","v11.5.15","v11.5.16","v11.5.17","v11.5.18","v11.5.19","v11.5.2","v11.5.20","v11.5.21","v11.5.22","v11.5.23","v11.5.24","v11.5.25","v11.5.26","v11.5.27","v11.5.28","v11.5.29","v11.5.3","v11.5.30","v11.5.31","v11.5.32","v11.5.33","v11.5.34","v11.5.35","v11.5.36","v11.5.4","v11.5.5","v11.5.6","v11.5.7","v11.5.8","v11.5.9","v12.0.0","v12.1.0","v12.2.0","v12.3.0","v12.4.0","v12.4.1","v12.4.10","v12.4.11","v12.4.12","v12.4.13","v12.4.14","v12.4.2","v12.4.3","v12.4.4","v12.4.5","v12.4.6","v12.4.7","v12.4.8","v12.4.9","v13.0.0","v13.1.0","v9.0.0","v9.1.0","v9.2.0","v9.3.0","v9.4.0","v9.5.0","v9.5.1","v9.5.2","v9.5.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-34357.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/typo3/typo3.cms","events":[{"introduced":"6a5e2d4097ef0a0e3ea955af93cf83810d6fa234"},{"fixed":"8c01ea0cd9f5ecd3003d46c5fae521784d619a73"}]}],"versions":["v11.0.0","v11.1.0","v11.2.0","v11.3.0","v11.4.0","v11.5.0","v11.5.1","v11.5.10","v11.5.11","v11.5.12","v11.5.13","v11.5.14","v11.5.15","v11.5.16","v11.5.17","v11.5.18","v11.5.19","v11.5.2","v11.5.20","v11.5.21","v11.5.22","v11.5.23","v11.5.24","v11.5.25","v11.5.26","v11.5.27","v11.5.28","v11.5.29","v11.5.3","v11.5.30","v11.5.31","v11.5.32","v11.5.33","v11.5.34","v11.5.35","v11.5.36","v11.5.4","v11.5.5","v11.5.6","v11.5.7","v11.5.8","v11.5.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-34357.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/commit/376474904f6b9a54dc1b785a2e45277cbd13b0d7"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/commit/b31d05d1da3eeaeead2d19eb43b1c3f9c88e15ee"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/commit/d774642381354d3bf5095a5a26e18acd2767f0b1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-hw6c-6gwq-3m3m"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2024-009"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
