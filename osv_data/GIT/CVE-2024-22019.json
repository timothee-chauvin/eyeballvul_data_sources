The server reads an unbounded number of bytes from a single connection, exploiting the lack of limitations on chunk extension bytes. The issue can cause CPU and network bandwidth exhaustion, bypassing standard safeguards like timeouts and body size limits.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nodejs/node","events":[{"introduced":"49a77a5a996a49e8cb728eed42e55a7c1a9eef6e"},{"fixed":"6610cc42ff50209248dd46d1ef947d1702fdf108"}]}],"versions":["v18.0.0","v18.1.0","v18.10.0","v18.11.0","v18.12.0","v18.12.1","v18.13.0","v18.14.0","v18.14.1","v18.14.2","v18.15.0","v18.16.0","v18.16.1","v18.17.0","v18.17.1","v18.18.0","v18.18.1","v18.18.2","v18.19.0","v18.2.0","v18.3.0","v18.4.0","v18.5.0","v18.6.0","v18.7.0","v18.8.0","v18.9.0","v18.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-22019.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240315-0004/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/2233486"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
