It achieves this by modifying the regular login view. Django however has a second login view for its admin area. This second login view was not modified, so the multi factor authentication can be bypassed. Users are affected if they have activated both django-mfa3 (< 0.5.0) and django.contrib.admin and have not taken any other measures to prevent users from accessing the admin login view. The issue has been fixed in django-mfa3 0.5.0. It is possible to work around the issue by overwriting the admin login route, e.g. by adding the following URL definition *before* the admin routes: url('admin/login/', lambda request: redirect(settings.LOGIN_URL)","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xi/django-mfa3","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5478c44b08a1ff2eb38a60dfdc9a6e7751351c04"}]}],"versions":["0.0.0","0.1.0","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.2","0.2.3","0.2.4","0.2.5","0.3.0","0.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24857.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/24xxx/CVE-2022-24857.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/xi/django-mfa3/blob/main/CHANGES.md#050-2022-04-15"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/xi/django-mfa3/commit/32f656e22df120b84bdf010e014bb19bd97971de"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/xi/django-mfa3/security/advisories/GHSA-3r7g-wrpr-j5g4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24857"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220609-0003/"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-287"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/24xxx/CVE-2022-24857.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
