  "details": "Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in users' editors. Versions below 3.26.0 contain a vulnerability in the command parsing logic where the Bash parameter expansion and indirect reference were not handled correctly. If the agent was configured to auto-approve execution of certain commands, an attacker able to influence prompts could abuse this weakness to execute additional arbitrary commands alongside the intended one. This is fixed in version 3.26.0.",
