Versions below 3.26.0 contain a vulnerability in the command parsing logic where the Bash parameter expansion and indirect reference were not handled correctly. If the agent was configured to auto-approve execution of certain commands, an attacker able to influence prompts could abuse this weakness to execute additional arbitrary commands alongside the intended one. This is fixed in version 3.26.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/roocodeinc/roo-code","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"840fe2a4c8b6331f2fcb43e4ddaba8950a0b4bf0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58370.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/security/advisories/GHSA-2rm5-cvcm-7592"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-78"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
