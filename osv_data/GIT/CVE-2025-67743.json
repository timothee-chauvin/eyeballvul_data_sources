In versions from 1.3.0 to before 1.3.9, the download service (download_service.py) makes HTTP requests using raw requests.get() without utilizing the application's SSRF protection (safe_requests.py). This can allow attackers to access internal services and attempt to reach cloud provider metadata endpoints (AWS/GCP/Azure), as well as perform internal network reconnaissance, by submitting malicious URLs through the API, depending on the deployment and surrounding controls. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.9.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/learningcircuit/local-deep-research","events":[{"introduced":"2d0dd093fb57b09efb8904b1857a0fb4e99a0dc3"},{"fixed":"8f31b0dfc203552616da6f9b073889c90e03f725"}]}],"versions":["v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67743.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67743.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/commit/b79089ff30c5d9ae77e6b903c408e1c26ad5c055"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/LearningCircuit/local-deep-research/security/advisories/GHSA-9c54-gxh7-ppjc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67743"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67743.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
