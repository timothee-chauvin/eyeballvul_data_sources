Since this negotiation depends on the answer, an attacker may craft packages in a way that hints the autopilot to adopt version 1.0 of MAVLink for the communication. Given the lack of authentication capabilities in such version of MAVLink (refer to CVE-2020-10282), attackers may use this method to bypass authentication capabilities and interact with the autopilot directly.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"f3eb010bfea94fbea50c65b039987d7c5b856e4e"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-10283.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RVD/issues/3316"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
