{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-30617","published":"2024-01-03T15:29:17.552Z","modified":"2025-12-04T23:49:17.959229Z","aliases":["GHSA-437m-7hj5-9mpw"],"summary":"Leverage the kruise-daemon pod to list all secrets in the entire cluster","details":"Kruise provides automated management of large-scale applications on Kubernetes. Starting in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions 1.3.1, 1.4.1, and 1.5.2, an attacker who has gained root privilege of the node that kruise-daemon run can leverage the kruise-daemon pod to list all secrets in the entire cluster. After that, the attacker can leverage the \"captured\" secrets (e.g. the kruise-manager service account token) to gain extra privileges such as pod modification. Versions 1.3.1, 1.4.1, and 1.5.2 fix this issue. A workaround is available. For users that do not require imagepulljob functions, they can modify kruise-daemon-role to drop the cluster level secret get/list privilege.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openkruise/kruise","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"914146d9a4a1a71e60789f7f9cee738b925b1996"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"= 1.4.0"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openkruise/kruise","events":[{"introduced":"a477df8066a49734bc71b9f3a1716897685a3d6f"},{"fixed":"5421ee7c8e9e54ec38c1c1e20f4deb4a722f47a7"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.5.0"},{"fixed":"1.5.2"}]}}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.0-beta.1","v0.1.0-beta.2","v0.10.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v1.0.0-alpha.1","v1.0.0-beta.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-30617.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/30xxx/CVE-2023-30617.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/openkruise/kruise/security/advisories/GHSA-437m-7hj5-9mpw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30617"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-250","CWE-269"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/30xxx/CVE-2023-30617.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
