In version 1.39.2, when parsing shader nodes in a MTLX file, the MaterialXCore code accesses a potentially null pointer, which can lead to crashes with maliciously crafted files. An attacker could intentionally crash a target program that uses OpenEXR by sending a malicious MTLX file. This is fixed in version 1.39.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/academysoftwarefoundation/materialx","events":[{"introduced":"c27914b8d0ed042948ee40526458f2673f5284fa"},{"fixed":"3b79bd735036dc96942836a9d076b6af3bd8fbdf"}]}],"versions":["v1.39.2","v1.39.3-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53010.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX/commit/e13344ba13326869d7820b444705f24d56fab73d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX/security/advisories/GHSA-3jhf-gxhr-q4cx"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ShielderSec/poc/tree/main/CVE-2025-53010"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
