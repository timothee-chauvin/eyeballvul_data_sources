  "id": "CVE-2024-36105",
  "details": "dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications. Prior to versions 1.6.15, 1.7.15, and 1.8.1, Binding to `INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0)` or `IN6ADDR_ANY (::)` exposes an application on all network interfaces, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. As stated in the Python docs, a special form for address is accepted instead of a host address: `''` represents `INADDR_ANY`, equivalent to `\"0.0.0.0\"`. On systems with IPv6, '' represents `IN6ADDR_ANY`, which is equivalent to `\"::\"`. A user who serves docs on an unsecured public network, may unknowingly be hosting an unsecured (http) web site for any remote user/system to access on the same network. The issue has has been mitigated in dbt-core v1.6.15, dbt-core v1.7.15, and dbt-core v1.8.1 by binding to localhost explicitly by default in `dbt docs serve`.\n",
