Prior to commit a1a41b7, the remoteBuild.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the mac-standalone artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the Github API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in the AdeptLanguage/Adept repository. This issue has been patched in commit a1a41b7.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/adeptlanguage/adept","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a1a41b72cdf1bebfc0cf6d7b3a8350e6406b2220"}]}],"versions":["v2.0","v2.1","v2.2","v2.3","v2.4","v2.5","v2.5-preview-build-oct-18-2021","v2.6","v2.6-preview-build-dec-2-2021","v2.6-preview-build-feb-22-2022","v2.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-32958.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/AdeptLanguage/Adept/security/advisories/GHSA-8c7v-vccv-cx4q"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/AdeptLanguage/Adept/commit/a1a41b72cdf1bebfc0cf6d7b3a8350e6406b2220"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
