A refactoring in commit `5c381cf` added the ability to get GitHub repositories registered to a project without specifying a specific provider.  Unfortunately, the SQL query for doing so was missing parenthesis, and would select a random repository. This issue is patched in pull request 2941. As a workaround, revert prior to `5c381cf`, or roll forward past `2eb94e7`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/stacklok/minder","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"11c13c202acb1e0a2e6ecb1e73b14ef79bc003c3"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"= 0.0.39"}]}}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.10","v0.0.11","v0.0.12","v0.0.13","v0.0.14","v0.0.15","v0.0.16","v0.0.17","v0.0.18","v0.0.19","v0.0.2","v0.0.20","v0.0.21","v0.0.22","v0.0.23","v0.0.24","v0.0.25","v0.0.26","v0.0.27","v0.0.28","v0.0.29","v0.0.3","v0.0.30","v0.0.31","v0.0.32","v0.0.33","v0.0.34","v0.0.35","v0.0.36","v0.0.37","v0.0.38","v0.0.39","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-31455.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mindersec/minder","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"11b6573ad62cfdd783a8bb52f3fce461466037f4"},{"fixed":"5c381cfbf3e4b7ce040ed8511a1fae1a78a0014b"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.10","v0.0.11","v0.0.12","v0.0.13","v0.0.14","v0.0.15","v0.0.16","v0.0.17","v0.0.18","v0.0.19","v0.0.2","v0.0.20","v0.0.21","v0.0.22","v0.0.23","v0.0.24","v0.0.25","v0.0.26","v0.0.27","v0.0.28","v0.0.29","v0.0.3","v0.0.30","v0.0.31","v0.0.32","v0.0.33","v0.0.34","v0.0.35","v0.0.36","v0.0.37","v0.0.38","v0.0.39","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-31455.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/stacklok/minder/security/advisories/GHSA-ggp5-28x4-xcj9"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/stacklok/minder/commit/11b6573ad62cfdd783a8bb52f3fce461466037f4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/stacklok/minder/commit/5c381cfbf3e4b7ce040ed8511a1fae1a78a0014b"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/stacklok/minder/pull/2941"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
