This heap overflow could lead to different damages. For example, a crafted TIFF document can lead to an out-of-bounds read in TIFFCleanup, an invalid free in TIFFClose or t2p_free, memory corruption in t2p_readwrite_pdf_image, or a double free in t2p_free. Given these possibilities, it probably could cause arbitrary code execution.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vadz/libtiff","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"4a25fa0efc03a4e71740efc748c24b93152b1807"}]}],"versions":["Pre360","Release-","Release-3-7-0","Release-v3-5-","Release-v3-5-4","Release-v3-5-5","Release-v3-5-7","Release-v3-6-0","Release-v3-6-0beta2","Release-v3-6-1","Release-v3-7-0-alpha","Release-v3-7-0beta","Release-v3-7-0beta2","Release-v3-7-1","Release-v3-7-2","Release-v3-7-3","Release-v3-7-4","Release-v3-8-0","Release-v3-8-1","Release-v3-8-2","Release-v4-0-0","Release-v4-0-0alpha","Release-v4-0-0alpha4","Release-v4-0-0alpha5","Release-v4-0-0alpha6","Release-v4-0-0beta7","Release-v4-0-1","Release-v4-0-2","Release-v4-0-3","Release-v4-0-4","Release-v4-0-4beta","Release-v4-0-5","Release-v4-0-6","Release-v4-0-7","Release-v4-0-8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-9935.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"84e1f1b66df4c91951cfc17556d5228d0d3e5c9f"}]}],"versions":["v3.5.3","v3.5.4","v3.5.5","v3.5.7","v3.6.0","v3.6.0beta2","v3.6.1","v3.7.0","v3.7.0alpha","v3.7.0beta","v3.7.0beta2","v3.7.1","v3.7.2","v3.7.3","v3.7.4","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.8.2","v4.0.0","v4.0.0alpha","v4.0.0alpha4","v4.0.0alpha5","v4.0.0alpha6","v4.0.0beta7","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.4beta","v4.0.5","v4.0.6","v4.0.7","v4.0.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-9935.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2704"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99296"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2017/12/msg00008.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3606-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4100"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
