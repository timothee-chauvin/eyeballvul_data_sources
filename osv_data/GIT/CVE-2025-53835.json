{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-53835","published":"2025-07-14T23:00:35.577Z","modified":"2025-11-28T11:34:41.936513Z","aliases":["GHSA-w3wh-g4m9-783p"],"summary":"XWiki Rendering is vulnerable to XSS attacks through insecure XHTML syntax","details":"XWiki Rendering is a generic rendering system that converts textual input in a given syntax (wiki syntax, HTML, etc) into another syntax (XHTML, etc). Starting in version 5.4.5 and prior to version 14.10, the XHTML syntax depended on the `xdom+xml/current` syntax which allows the creation of raw blocks that permit the insertion of arbitrary HTML content including JavaScript. This allows XSS attacks for users who can edit a document like their user profile (enabled by default). This has been fixed in version 14.10 by removing the dependency on the `xdom+xml/current` syntax from the XHTML syntax. Note that the `xdom+xml` syntax is still vulnerable to this attack. As it's main purpose is testing and its use is quite difficult, this syntax shouldn't be installed or used on a regular wiki. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform","events":[{"introduced":"7624af4939a46405cdfb3ad53e3bef7fc31b615d"},{"fixed":"c524887d154ff8f6df9651e36b904e234bf5a6ef"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53835.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a4ca31f99f524b9456c64150d6f375984aa81ea7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53835.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons","events":[{"introduced":"6c03713c852a1fe73466c6001f0c70b03637a577"},{"fixed":"719ede2f8510fa69498761659de8d65eec5817db"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53835.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/commit/a4ca31f99f524b9456c64150d6f375984aa81ea7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/security/advisories/GHSA-w3wh-g4m9-783p"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-660"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79","CWE-80"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
