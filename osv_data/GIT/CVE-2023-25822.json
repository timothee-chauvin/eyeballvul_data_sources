{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-25822","published":"2023-10-09T13:13:53.391Z","modified":"2025-12-09T17:00:15.355831Z","aliases":["GHSA-mj24-gpw7-23m9"],"summary":"ReportPortal DoS vulnerability on creating a Launch with too many recursively nested elements","details":"ReportPortal is an AI-powered test automation platform. Prior to version 5.10.0 of the `com.epam.reportportal:service-api` module, corresponding to ReportPortal version 23.2, the ReportPortal database becomes unstable and reporting almost fully stops except for small launches with approximately 1 test inside when the test_item.path field is exceeded the allowable `ltree` field type indexing limit (path length>=120, approximately recursive nesting of the nested steps). REINDEX INDEX path_gist_idx and path_idx aren't helped. The problem was fixed in `com.epam.reportportal:service-api` module version 5.10.0 (product release 23.2), where the maximum number of nested elements were programmatically limited. A workaround is available. After deletion of the data with long paths, and reindexing both indexes (path_gist_idx and path_idx), the database becomes stable and ReportPortal works properly.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e1f85b2020b3bc32e5ebd469050811ace7f9e32f"}]}],"versions":["2.7.0","23.1","23.1.1","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.5","3.0.RC","3.0.RC1","3.1.1","3.2.0","3.3.0","3.3.2","3.3.2-1","4.0.0","4.0.0RC","4.1.0","4.2.0","4.3","5.0RC","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.2.2","5.2.3","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.3.4","5.3.5","5.4.0","5.5.0","5.6.0","5.6.1","5.6.2","5.6.3","5.7.0","5.7.1","5.7.2","5.7.3","5.7.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-25822.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/reportportal/service-api","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a3e183f0bd423de3164275ffa2d50bb9b68bcbfb"}]}],"versions":["2.6.0","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.7.2","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.3.0","3.3.1","4.0.0","4.1.0","4.1.1","4.2.0","4.2.1","4.3.0","4.3.1","4.3.10","4.3.11","4.3.2","4.3.3","4.3.4","4.3.5","4.3.6","4.3.7","4.3.8","4.3.9","5.0.0","5.1.0","5.1.0-RC","5.1.0-RC-2","5.1.0-RC-3","5.1.1","5.2.0","5.2.0-RC","5.2.1","5.2.2","5.2.3","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.3.4","5.3.5","5.4.0","5.5.0","5.5.1","5.6.0","5.7.0","5.7.1","5.7.1-hot-fix","5.7.2","5.7.3","5.7.4","5.8.0","5.9.0","5.9.1","v4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-25822.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/25xxx/CVE-2023-25822.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/releases/tag/v23.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/security/advisories/GHSA-mj24-gpw7-23m9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25822"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://reportportal.io/docs/releases/Version23.2/"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/25xxx/CVE-2023-25822.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H"}]}
