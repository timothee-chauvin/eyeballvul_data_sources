This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/toolstack/cyan-backup","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4a79d23e8ba330b5cb655a083c6a00ef32a7b249"}]}],"versions":["2.4","2.5","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.5.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-12092.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3390065/cyan-backup/tags/2.5.5/includes/page-backups.php"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/39972b06-920f-48b0-aa36-bb5caab87cb6?source=cve"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/toolstack/cyan-backup/commit/4a79d23e8ba330b5cb655a083c6a00ef32a7b249"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
