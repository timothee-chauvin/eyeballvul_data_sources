However, if the timer handler is already running, the\ntimer_delete_sync() is not called. This leads to race conditions\nwhere the devlink that contains the ptp_ocp is deallocated while\nthe timer handler is still accessing it, resulting in use-after-free\nbugs. The following details one of the race scenarios.\n\n(thread 1)                           | (thread 2)\nptp_ocp_remove()                     |\n  ptp_ocp_detach()                   |
