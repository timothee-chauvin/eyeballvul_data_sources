Prior to version 5.1.1, the protections against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) were insufficient application-wide. The referrer header is checked, and if it is invalid, the server returns 403. However, the referrer header can be dropped from CSRF requests using `<meta name=\"referrer\" content=\"never\">`, effectively bypassing this protection. Version 5.1.1 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/obiba/opal","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"cd7da94135a3e7f42a4dd109c5e64439d197dc43"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.1.1"}]}}],"versions":["1.10.9","1.11.0","1.11.1","1.15.0","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.15.3","2.0-M2","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.2.0","4.0.3","4.7.4-java8","5.0.0","5.0.0-RC1","5.0.0-RC2","5.0.0-RC3","5.0.0-RC4","5.0.0-RC5","5.0.1","5.0.2","5.0.3","5.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27792.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/27xxx/CVE-2025-27792.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/obiba/opal/security/advisories/GHSA-27vw-29rq-c358"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27792"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-352"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/27xxx/CVE-2025-27792.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
