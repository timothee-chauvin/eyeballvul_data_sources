In versions 2.0.0 through 2.4.13.1, when `OIDCStripCookies` is set and a crafted cookie supplied, a NULL pointer dereference would occur, resulting in a segmentation fault. This could be used in a Denial-of-Service attack and thus presents an availability risk. Version 2.4.13.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid using `OIDCStripCookies`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openidc/mod_auth_openidc","events":[{"introduced":"4fe40bd8bed0c7697f4fb2c3733d02d472cb849e"},{"fixed":"3f11976dab56af0a46a7dddb7a275cc16d6eb726"}]}],"versions":["2.3.11rc1","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.1.6","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.0rc0","v2.3.0rc3","v2.3.1","v2.3.10","v2.3.10.1","v2.3.10.2","v2.3.11","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.7","v2.3.8","v2.3.9","v2.4.0","v2.4.0.1","v2.4.0.2","v2.4.0.3","v2.4.0.4","v2.4.1","v2.4.10","v2.4.11","v2.4.11.1","v2.4.11.2","v2.4.11.3","v2.4.12","v2.4.12.1","v2.4.12.2","v2.4.12.3","v2.4.13","v2.4.13.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.2.1","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.4.1","v2.4.5","v2.4.6","v2.4.7","v2.4.7.1","v2.4.7.2","v2.4.8.1","v2.4.8.2","v2.4.8.3","v2.4.8.4","v2.4.9","v2.4.9.1","v2.4.9.2","v2.4.9.3","v2.4.9.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-28625.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/blame/3f11976dab56af0a46a7dddb7a275cc16d6eb726/src/mod_auth_openidc.c#L178-L179"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/commit/c0e1edac3c4c19988ccdc7713d7aebfce6ff916a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/releases/tag/v2.4.13.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/security/advisories/GHSA-f5xw-rvfr-24qr"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00034.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WIBKFC22PDH6UXMSZ23PHTD7736ZC7BB/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5405"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
