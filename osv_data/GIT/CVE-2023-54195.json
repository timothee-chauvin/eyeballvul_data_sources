The timer will be started when the first packet is transmitted.\n\nIt shouldn't be possible to trigger this directly from userspace through\nAF_RXRPC as sendmsg() will return EBUSY if the call is in the\nwaiting-for-conn state if it dropped out of the wait due to a signal.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9d35d880e0e4a3ab32d8c12f9e4d76198aadd42d"},{"fixed":"92128a7170a220b5126d09a1c1954a3a8d46cef3"},{"fixed":"72f4a9f3f447948cf86dffe1c4a4c8a429ab9666"},{"fixed":"db099c625b13a74d462521a46d98a8ce5b53af5d"}]}],"versions":["v6.2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.2.1","v6.2.10","v6.2.11","v6.2.12","v6.2.13","v6.2.14","v6.2.15","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4","v6.2.5","v6.2.6","v6.2.7","v6.2.8","v6.2.9","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.3.1","v6.3.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54195.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.16"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.3.0"},{"fixed":"6.3.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54195.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/72f4a9f3f447948cf86dffe1c4a4c8a429ab9666"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/92128a7170a220b5126d09a1c1954a3a8d46cef3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/db099c625b13a74d462521a46d98a8ce5b53af5d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54195.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54195"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54195.json"}}
