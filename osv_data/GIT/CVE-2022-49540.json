The key point\nhere is that the purpose of this RCU flavor is to force a schedule on\neach online CPU since some past event.  But the rcu_tasks_rude_wait_gp()\nfunction runs in the context of the RCU Tasks Rude's grace-period kthread,\nso there must already have been a context switch on the current CPU since\nthe call to either synchronize_rcu_tasks_rude() or call_rcu_tasks_rude().\nSo if there is only a single CPU online, RCU Tasks Rude's grace-period\nkthread does not need to anything at all.\n\nIt turns out that the rcu_tasks_rude_wait_gp() function's call to\nschedule_on_each_cpu() causes problems during early boot.  During that\ntime, there is only one online CPU, namely the boot CPU.  Therefore,\napplying this single-CPU optimization fixes early-boot instances of\nthis problem.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"c84aad765406c4c7573ce449e8a9977ebb8f4cb9"},{"fixed":"1c6c3f2336642fb3074593911f5176565f47ec41"},{"fixed":"ba722d061bc4b54802d701fc63fc2fd988934603"},{"fixed":"230bf5878af6038dfb63d9184272a58475236580"},{"fixed":"8f49a8758b5cd541bd7aa9a0d0d11c7426141c0e"},{"fixed":"f75fd4b9221d93177c50dcfde671b2e907f53e86"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.10.1","v5.10.10","v5.10.100","v5.10.101","v5.10.102","v5.10.103","v5.10.104","v5.10.105","v5.10.106","v5.10.107","v5.10.108","v5.10.109","v5.10.11","v5.10.110","v5.10.111","v5.10.112","v5.10.113","v5.10.114","v5.10.115","v5.10.116","v5.10.117","v5.10.118","v5.10.119","v5.10.12","v5.10.120","v5.10.13","v5.10.14","v5.10.15","v5.10.16","v5.10.17","v5.10.18","v5.10.19","v5.10.2","v5.10.20","v5.10.21","v5.10.22","v5.10.23","v5.10.24","v5.10.25","v5.10.26","v5.10.27","v5.10.28","v5.10.29","v5.10.3","v5.10.30","v5.10.31","v5.10.32","v5.10.33","v5.10.34","v5.10.35","v5.10.36","v5.10.37","v5.10.38","v5.10.39","v5.10.4","v5.10.40","v5.10.41","v5.10.42","v5.10.43","v5.10.44","v5.10.45","v5.10.46","v5.10.47","v5.10.48","v5.10.49","v5.10.5","v5.10.50","v5.10.51","v5.10.52","v5.10.53","v5.10.54","v5.10.55","v5.10.56","v5.10.57","v5.10.58","v5.10.59","v5.10.6","v5.10.60","v5.10.61","v5.10.62","v5.10.63","v5.10.64","v5.10.65","v5.10.66","v5.10.67","v5.10.68","v5.10.69","v5.10.7","v5.10.70","v5.10.71","v5.10.72","v5.10.73","v5.10.74","v5.10.75","v5.10.76","v5.10.77","v5.10.78","v5.10.79","v5.10.8","v5.10.80","v5.10.81","v5.10.82","v5.10.83","v5.10.84","v5.10.85","v5.10.86","v5.10.87","v5.10.88","v5.10.89","v5.10.9","v5.10.90","v5.10.91","v5.10.92","v5.10.93","v5.10.94","v5.10.95","v5.10.96","v5.10.97","v5.10.98","v5.10.99","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.5","v5.15.6","v5.15.7","v5.15.8","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.17.1","v5.17.10","v5.17.11","v5.17.12","v5.17.13","v5.17.2","v5.17.3","v5.17.4","v5.17.5","v5.17.6","v5.17.7","v5.17.8","v5.17.9","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.18.1","v5.18.2","v5.7","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49540.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.8.0"},{"fixed":"5.10.121"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.11.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.46"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.17.14"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.18.0"},{"fixed":"5.18.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49540.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1c6c3f2336642fb3074593911f5176565f47ec41"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/230bf5878af6038dfb63d9184272a58475236580"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8f49a8758b5cd541bd7aa9a0d0d11c7426141c0e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ba722d061bc4b54802d701fc63fc2fd988934603"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f75fd4b9221d93177c50dcfde671b2e907f53e86"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49540.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49540"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_fro
