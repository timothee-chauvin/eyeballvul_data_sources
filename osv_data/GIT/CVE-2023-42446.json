{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-42446","published":"2023-09-18T21:29:22Z","modified":"2025-10-30T20:50:58.145604Z","aliases":["GHSA-3cjh-p6pw-jhv9"],"summary":"Pow Mnesia cache doesn't invalidate all expired keys on startup","details":"Pow is a authentication and user management solution for Phoenix and Plug-based apps. Starting in version 1.0.14 and prior to version 1.0.34, use of `Pow.Store.Backend.MnesiaCache` is susceptible to session hijacking as expired keys are not being invalidated correctly on startup. A session may expire when all `Pow.Store.Backend.MnesiaCache` instances have been shut down for a period that is longer than a session's remaining TTL. Version 1.0.34 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, expired keys, including all expired sessions, can be manually invalidated.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pow-auth/pow","events":[{"introduced":"521e5d420e1f00d4b9bf1667af5046a376d72c5b"},{"fixed":"16151ae609bebed18afcad7a38d66faeedb95294"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.0.14"},{"fixed":"1.0.34"}]}}],"versions":["v1.0.14","v1.0.15","v1.0.16","v1.0.17","v1.0.18","v1.0.19","v1.0.20","v1.0.21","v1.0.22","v1.0.23","v1.0.24","v1.0.25","v1.0.26","v1.0.27","v1.0.28","v1.0.29","v1.0.30","v1.0.31","v1.0.32","v1.0.33"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-42446.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/danschultzer/pow","events":[{"introduced":"521e5d420e1f00d4b9bf1667af5046a376d72c5b"},{"fixed":"16151ae609bebed18afcad7a38d66faeedb95294"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.14","v1.0.15","v1.0.16","v1.0.17","v1.0.18","v1.0.19","v1.0.20","v1.0.21","v1.0.22","v1.0.23","v1.0.24","v1.0.25","v1.0.26","v1.0.27","v1.0.28","v1.0.29","v1.0.30","v1.0.31","v1.0.32","v1.0.33"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-42446.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pow-auth/pow/security/advisories/GHSA-3cjh-p6pw-jhv9"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/pow-auth/pow/issues/713"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-298"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
