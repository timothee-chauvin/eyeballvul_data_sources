{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68353","published":"2025-12-24T10:32:44.068Z","modified":"2025-12-24T21:05:54.166341Z","summary":"net: vxlan: prevent NULL deref in vxlan_xmit_one","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: vxlan: prevent NULL deref in vxlan_xmit_one\n\nNeither sock4 nor sock6 pointers are guaranteed to be non-NULL in\nvxlan_xmit_one, e.g. if the iface is brought down. This can lead to the\nfollowing NULL dereference:\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000010\n  Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI\n  RIP: 0010:vxlan_xmit_one+0xbb3/0x1580\n  Call Trace:\n   vxlan_xmit+0x429/0x610\n   dev_hard_start_xmit+0x55/0xa0\n   __dev_queue_xmit+0x6d0/0x7f0\n   ip_finish_output2+0x24b/0x590\n   ip_output+0x63/0x110\n\nMentioned commits changed the code path in vxlan_xmit_one and as a side\neffect the sock4/6 pointer validity checks in vxlan(6)_get_route were\nlost. Fix this by adding back checks.\n\nSince both commits being fixed were released in the same version (v6.7)\nand are strongly related, bundle the fixes in a single commit.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"6f19b2c136d98a84d79030b53e23d405edfdc783"},{"fixed":"4ac26aafdc8c7271414e2e7c0b2cb266a26591bc"},{"fixed":"1f73a56f986005f0bc64ed23873930e2ee4f5911"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.6","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68353.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68353.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1f73a56f986005f0bc64ed23873930e2ee4f5911"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4ac26aafdc8c7271414e2e7c0b2cb266a26591bc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68353.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68353"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68353.json"}}
