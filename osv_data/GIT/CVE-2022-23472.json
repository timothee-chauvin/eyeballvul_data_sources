Versions prior to 1.0.5 rely on the python `random` library for random value selection. The python `random` library warns that it should not be used for security purposes due to its reliance on a non-cryptographically secure random number generator. As a result a motivated attacker may be able to guess generated passwords. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/arjunsharda/passeo","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5f1573baf1a329ae23e27240b8a6d2dfe2a6eea6"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23472.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ArjunSharda/Passeo/commit/8caa798b6bc4647dca59b2376204b6dc6176361a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ArjunSharda/Passeo/security/advisories/GHSA-mhhf-vgwh-fw9h"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://peps.python.org/pep-0506/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-338"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
