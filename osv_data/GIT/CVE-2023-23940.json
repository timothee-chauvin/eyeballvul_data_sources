{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-23940","published":"2023-02-03T19:43:11Z","modified":"2025-11-04T19:33:04Z","aliases":["GHSA-626q-v9j4-mcp4"],"summary":"OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo is vulnerable to signature validation bypass","details":"OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo is a library for secure smart contract development written in Cairo for StarkNet, a decentralized ZK Rollup. `is_valid_eth_signature` is missing a call to `finalize_keccak` after calling `verify_eth_signature`. As a result, any contract using `is_valid_eth_signature` from the account library (such as the `EthAccount` preset) is vulnerable to a malicious sequencer. Specifically, the malicious sequencer would be able to bypass signature validation to impersonate an instance of these accounts. The issue has been patched in 0.6.1.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openzeppelin/cairo-contracts","events":[{"introduced":"d3ee30b9368d52d82dc52e2a4e7c9f93a04e171f"},{"fixed":"1f9359219a92cdb1576f953db71ee993b8ef5f70"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-23940.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/pull/542/commits/6d4cb750478fca2fd916f73297632f899aca9299"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-626q-v9j4-mcp4"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-345","CWE-347"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L"}]}
