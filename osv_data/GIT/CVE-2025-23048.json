In such a case, a client trusted to access one virtual host may be able to access another virtual host, if SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck is not enabled in either virtual host.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/httpd","events":[{"introduced":"69374fc08f3cda06a7acfc1cb6fe4fc0ce277f63"},{"fixed":"7e926454793abd7d71b6afc8bd1ec1648752c6ad"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-23048.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
