{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-52569","published":"2025-06-25T16:41:46Z","modified":"2025-11-06T22:57:10.234159Z","aliases":["GHSA-jg9p-c3wh-q83x","JLSEC-2025-5"],"summary":"GitHub.jl lacks validation for user-provided fields","details":"GitForge.jl is a unified interface for interacting with Git \"forges.\" Versions prior to 5.9.1 lack input validation of input validation for user-provided values in certain functions. In the `GitHub.repo()` function, the user can provide any string for the `repo_name` field. These inputs are not validated or safely encoded and are sent directly to the server. This means a user can add path traversal patterns like `../` in the input to access any other endpoints on `api.github.com` that were not intended. Users should upgrade immediately to v5.9.1 or later to receive a patch. All prior versions are vulnerable. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/juliaweb/github.jl","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"97a4ad1e5844a6aa3511b1221bcee69aba06673e"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.9.1"}]}}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.1.0","v4.0.0","v4.1.0","v5.0.0","v5.0.1","v5.0.2","v5.1.0","v5.1.1","v5.1.2","v5.1.3","v5.1.4","v5.1.5","v5.1.6","v5.1.7","v5.1.8","v5.2.0","v5.3.0","v5.4.0","v5.5.0","v5.6.0","v5.7.0","v5.7.1","v5.7.2","v5.7.3","v5.8.0","v5.8.1","v5.8.2","v5.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52569.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/JuliaWeb/GitHub.jl/pull/224"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/JuliaWeb/GitHub.jl/security/advisories/GHSA-jg9p-c3wh-q83x"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20","CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
