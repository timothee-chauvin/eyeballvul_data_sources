This argument is plausibly an untrusted value from an application's input data that was supposed to contain a name and an e-mail address. NOTE: email.utils.parseaddr is categorized as a Legacy API in the documentation of the Python email package. Applications should instead use the email.parser.BytesParser or email.parser.Parser class. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that this is neither a vulnerability nor a bug. The email package is intended to have size limits and to throw an exception when limits are exceeded; they were exceeded by the example demonstration code.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/python/cpython","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"d2340ef25721b6a72d45d4508c672c4be38c67d3"}]}],"versions":["2.5","3.2","v0.9.8","v0.9.9","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1","v1.1.1","v1.2","v1.2b1","v1.2b2","v1.2b3","v1.2b4","v1.3","v1.3b1","v1.4","v1.4b1","v1.4b2","v1.4b3","v1.5","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.2a1","v1.5.2a2","v1.5.2b1","v1.5.2b2","v1.5.2c1","v1.5a1","v1.5a2","v1.5a3","v1.5a4","v1.5b1","v1.5b2","v1.6a1","v1.6a2","v2.0","v2.0b1","v2.0b2","v2.0c1","v2.1","v2.1a1","v2.1a2","v2.1b1","v2.1b2","v2.1c1","v2.1c2","v2.2a3","v2.3c1","v2.3c2","v2.4","v2.4a1","v2.4a2","v2.4a3","v2.4b1","v2.4b2","v2.4c1","v2.5","v2.5.1","v2.5.1c1","v2.5.2","v2.5.2c1","v2.5.3","v2.5.3c1","v2.5.4","v2.5.5","v2.5.5c1","v2.5.5c2","v2.5.6","v2.5.6c1","v2.5a0","v2.5a1","v2.5a2","v2.5b1","v2.5b2","v2.5b3","v2.5c1","v2.5c2","v2.6","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.6.2c1","v2.6.3","v2.6.3rc1","v2.6.4","v2.6.4rc1","v2.6.4rc2","v2.6.5","v2.6.5rc1","v2.6.5rc2","v2.6.6","v2.6.6rc1","v2.6.6rc2","v2.6.7","v2.6.8","v2.6.8rc1","v2.6.8rc2","v2.6a1","v2.6a2","v2.6a3","v2.6b1","v2.6b2","v2.6b3","v2.6rc1","v2.6rc2","v2.7","v2.7.1","v2.7.1rc1","v2.7.2","v2.7.2rc1","v2.7.3","v2.7.3rc1","v2.7.3rc2","v2.7.4rc1","v2.7a1","v2.7a2","v2.7a3","v2.7a4","v2.7b1","v2.7b2","v2.7rc1","v2.7rc2","v3.0a1","v3.0a2","v3.0a3","v3.0a4","v3.0a5","v3.0b1","v3.0b2","v3.0b3","v3.0rc1","v3.0rc2","v3.0rc3","v3.1","v3.1.1","v3.1.1rc1","v3.1.2","v3.1.2rc1","v3.1.3","v3.1.3rc1","v3.1.4","v3.1.4rc1","v3.1.5","v3.1.5rc1","v3.1.5rc2","v3.10.0a1","v3.10.0a2","v3.10.0a3","v3.10.0a4","v3.10.0a5","v3.10.0a6","v3.10.0a7","v3.11.0","v3.11.0a1","v3.11.0a2","v3.11.0a3","v3.11.0a4","v3.11.0a5","v3.11.0a6","v3.11.0a7","v3.11.0b1","v3.11.0b2","v3.11.0b3","v3.11.0b4","v3.11.0b5","v3.11.0rc1","v3.11.0rc2","v3.11.1","v3.11.2","v3.11.3","v3.11.4","v3.1a1","v3.1a2","v3.1b1","v3.1rc1","v3.1rc2","v3.2","v3.2.1","v3.2.1b1","v3.2.1rc1","v3.2.1rc2","v3.2.2","v3.2.2rc1","v3.2.3","v3.2.3rc1","v3.2.3rc2","v3.2.4","v3.2.4rc1","v3.2.5","v3.2.6","v3.2.6rc1","v3.2a1","v3.2a2","v3.2a3","v3.2a4","v3.2b1","v3.2b2","v3.2rc1","v3.2rc2","v3.2rc3","v3.3.0","v3.3.0a1","v3.3.0a2","v3.3.0a3","v3.3.0a4","v3.3.0b1","v3.3.0b2","v3.3.0rc1","v3.3.0rc2","v3.3.0rc3","v3.3.1","v3.3.1rc1","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.3.3rc1","v3.3.3rc2","v3.3.4","v3.3.4rc1","v3.3.5","v3.3.5rc1","v3.3.5rc2","v3.3.6","v3.3.6rc1","v3.4.0","v3.4.0a1","v3.4.0a2","v3.4.0a3","v3.4.0a4","v3.4.0b1","v3.4.0b2","v3.4.0b3","v3.4.0rc1","v3.4.0rc2","v3.4.0rc3","v3.4.1","v3.4.1rc1","v3.4.2","v3.4.2rc1","v3.4.3","v3.4.3rc1","v3.4.4","v3.4.4rc1","v3.4.5","v3.4.5rc1","v3.4.6","v3.4.6rc1","v3.5.0","v3.5.0a1","v3.5.0a2","v3.5.0a3","v3.5.0a4","v3.5.0b1","v3.5.0b2","v3.5.0b3","v3.5.0b4","v3.5.0rc1","v3.5.0rc2","v3.5.0rc3","v3.5.0rc4","v3.5.1","v3.5.1rc1","v3.5.2","v3.5.2rc1","v3.5.3","v3.5.3rc1","v3.6.0","v3.6.0a1","v3.6.0a2","v3.6.0a3","v3.6.0a4","v3.6.0b1","v3.6.0b2","v3.6.0b3","v3.6.0b4","v3.6.0rc1","v3.6.0rc2","v3.7.0a1","v3.7.0a2","v3.7.0a3","v3.7.0a4","v3.8.0a1","v3.8.0a2","v3.8.0a3","v3.8.0a4","v3.8.0b1","v3.9.0a1","v3.9.0a2","v3.9.0a3","v3.9.0a4","v3.9.0a5","v3.9.0a6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-36632.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103800"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.utils.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Daybreak2019/PoC_python3.9_Vul/blob/main/RecursionError-email.utils.parseaddr.py"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
