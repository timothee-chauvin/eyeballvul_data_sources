  "details": "OpenReplay is a self-hosted session replay suite. In version 1.14.0, due to lack of validation Name field - Account Settings (for registration looks like validation is correct), a bad actor can send emails with HTML injected code to the victims. Bad actors can use this to phishing actions for example. Email is really send from OpenReplay, but bad actors can add there HTML code injected (content spoofing). Please notice that during Registration steps for FullName looks like is validated correct - can not type there, but using this kind of bypass/workaround - bad actors can achieve own goal. As of time of publication, no known fixes or workarounds are available.",
