Starting in version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.8.7 and 2.0.4, a malicious expression can use the transform operator to override properties on the `Object` constructor and prototype. This may lead to denial of service, remote code execution or other unexpected behavior in applications that evaluate user-provided JSONata expressions. This issue has been fixed in JSONata versions 1.8.7 and 2.0.4. Applications that evaluate user-provided expressions should update ASAP to prevent exploitation. As a workaround, one may apply the patch manually.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata","events":[{"introduced":"99717d99a5417c2bb9248eb7e6bde531e3642b4c"},{"fixed":"57314161b6bd95c9806d723016e9749af2179049"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-27307.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/security/advisories/GHSA-fqg8-vfv7-8fj8"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/commit/1d579dbe99c19fbe509f5ba2c6db7959b0d456d1"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/commit/335d38f6278e96c908b24183f1c9c90afc8ae00c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/commit/c907b5e517bb718015fcbd993d742ba6202f2be2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jsonata-js/jsonata/releases/tag/v2.0.4"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1321"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
