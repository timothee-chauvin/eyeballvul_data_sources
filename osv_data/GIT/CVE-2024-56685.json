Since the sound card driver's probe happens before the card\nregistration, accessing any of the members of a dummy component during\nprobe will result in undefined behavior.\n\nThis can be observed in the mt8188 and mt8195 machine sound drivers. By\nomitting a dai link subnode in the sound card's node in the Devicetree,\nthe default uninitialized dummy codec is used, and when its dai_name\npointer gets passed to strcmp() it results in a null pointer dereference\nand a kernel panic.\n\nIn addition to that, set_card_codec_info() in the generic helpers file,\nmtk-soundcard-driver.c, will populate a dai link with a dummy codec when\na dai link node is present in DT but with no codec property.\n\nThe result is that at probe time, a dummy codec can either be\nuninitialized with num_codecs = 0, or be an initialized dummy codec,\nwith num_codecs = 1 and dai_name = \"snd-soc-dummy-dai\". In order to\naccommodate for both situations, check that num_codecs is not zero\nbefore accessing the codecs' fields but still check for the codec's dai\nname against \"snd-soc-dummy-dai\" as needed.\n\nWhile at it, also drop the check that dai_name is not null in the mt8192\ndriver, introduced in commit 4d4e1b6319e5 (\"ASoC: mediatek: mt8192:\nCheck existence of dai_name before dereferencing\"), as it is actually\nredundant given the preceding num_codecs != 0 check.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"13f58267cda3d6946c8f4de368ad5d4a003baa61"},{"fixed":"376f4800f34a28def026ff5c5d4fc5e54e1744ff"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"13f58267cda3d6946c8f4de368ad5d4a003baa61"},{"fixed":"550279449ff54c5aa28cfca5c567308cbfb145f0"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"13f58267cda3d6946c8f4de368ad5d4a003baa61"},{"fixed":"2f2020327cc8561d7c520d2f2d9acea84fa7b3a3"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.11.1","v6.11.10","v6.11.2","v6.11.3","v6.11.4","v6.11.5","v6.11.6","v6.11.7","v6.11.8","v6.11.9","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.7","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-56685.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.11.11"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-56685.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2f2020327cc8561d7c520d2f2d9acea84fa7b3a3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/376f4800f34a28def026ff5c5d4fc5e54e1744ff"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/550279449ff54c5aa28cfca5c567308cbfb145f0"}]}
