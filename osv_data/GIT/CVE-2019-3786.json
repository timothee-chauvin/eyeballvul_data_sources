{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2019-3786","published":"2019-04-24T16:29:01Z","modified":"2025-10-21T05:07:52.531015Z","details":"Cloud Foundry BOSH Backup and Restore CLI, all versions prior to 1.5.0, does not check the authenticity of backup scripts in BOSH. A remote authenticated malicious user can modify the metadata file of a Bosh Backup and Restore job to request extra backup files from different jobs upon restore. The exploited hooks in this metadata script were only maintained in the cfcr-etcd-release, so clusters deployed with the BBR job for etcd in this release are vulnerable.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-backup-and-restore","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"03a5a1bfb128772ea16f4fc0125cd2333805000b"}]}],"versions":["1.0-beta.1.3","v0.1.0-rc.219","v0.1.0-rc.220","v0.1.0-rc.221","v0.1.0-rc.222","v0.1.0-rc.223","v0.1.0-rc.224","v0.1.0-rc.225","v0.1.0-rc.226","v0.1.0-rc.227","v0.1.0-rc.228","v0.1.0-rc.229","v0.1.0-rc.230","v0.1.0-rc.231","v0.1.0-rc.232","v0.1.0-rc.233","v0.1.0-rc.234","v0.1.0-rc.235","v0.1.0-rc.236","v0.1.0-rc.237","v0.1.0-rc.238","v0.1.0-rc.239","v0.1.0-rc.240","v0.1.0-rc.241","v0.1.0-rc.242","v0.1.0-rc.243","v0.1.0-rc.244","v0.1.0-rc.245","v0.1.0-rc.246","v0.1.0-rc.247","v0.1.0-rc.248","v0.1.0-rc.249","v0.1.0-rc.250","v0.1.0-rc.251","v0.1.0-rc.252","v0.1.0-rc.253","v0.1.0-rc.254","v0.1.1-rc.11","v0.1.2","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-beta.4","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-alpha","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-3786.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2019-3786"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N"}]}
