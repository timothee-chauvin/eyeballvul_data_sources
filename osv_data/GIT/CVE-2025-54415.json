In versions 0.23.0a8 and below, a high-severity vulnerability has been identified in the cicd.yml workflow within the astronomer/dag-factory GitHub repository. The workflow, specifically when triggered by pull_request_target, is susceptible to exploitation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the GitHub Actions runner environment. This misconfiguration enables an attacker to establish a reverse shell, exfiltrate sensitive secrets, including the highly-privileged GITHUB_TOKEN, and ultimately gain full control over the repository. This is fixed in version 0.23.0a9.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"159de23347d9424a3a810dda7f3ff301052bb322"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54415.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54415.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/commit/751c0e58369e784f6a924347e381a705ea8133fe"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/pull/460"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/pull/466"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/security/advisories/GHSA-g5hx-xv45-9whg"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54415"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-78"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54415.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:U"}]}
