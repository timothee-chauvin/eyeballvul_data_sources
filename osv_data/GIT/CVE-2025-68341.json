For NAPI this is correctly handled as the\nnapi_schedule_prep() check will prevent multiple instances from getting\nscheduled, but for the remaining code in veth_pool() this can run\nconcurrent with the newly started NAPI instance.\n\nThe problem/race is that xdp_clear_return_frame_no_direct() isn't\ndesigned to be nested.\n\nPrior to commit 401cb7dae813 (\"net: Reference bpf_redirect_info via\ntask_struct on PREEMPT_RT.\") the temporary BPF net context\nbpf_redirect_info was stored per CPU, where this wasn't an issue. Since\nthis commit the BPF context is stored in 'current' task_struct. When\nrunning veth in threaded-NAPI mode, then the kthread becomes the storage\narea. Now a race exists between two concurrent veth_pool() function calls\none exiting NAPI and one running new NAPI, both using the same BPF net\ncontext.\n\nRace is when another CPU gets within the xdp_set_return_frame_no_direct()\nsection before exiting veth_pool() calls the clear-function\nxdp_clear_return_frame_no_direct().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"401cb7dae8130fd34eb84648e02ab4c506df7d5e"},{"fixed":"c1ceabcb347d1b0f7e70a7384ec7eff3847b7628"},{"fixed":"d0bd018ad72a8a598ae709588934135017f8af52"},{"fixed":"a14602fcae17a3f1cb8a8521bedf31728f9e7e39"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.59","v6.12.6","v6.12.60","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.10","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68341.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.11.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.61"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.11"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68341.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a14602fcae17a3f1cb8a8521bedf31728f9e7e39"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c1ceabcb347d1b0f7e70a7384ec7eff3847b7628"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d0bd018ad72a8a598ae709588934135017f8af52"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68341.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68341"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68341.json"}}
