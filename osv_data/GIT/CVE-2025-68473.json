{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68473","published":"2025-12-26T23:54:47.709Z","modified":"2025-12-29T19:54:35.219105Z","aliases":["GHSA-hmjj-rjvv-w8pq"],"summary":"ESF-IDF Has Out-of-Bounds Read in ESP32 Bluetooth SDP Result Handling","details":"ESF-IDF is the Espressif Internet of Things (IOT) Development Framework. In versions 5.5.1, 5.4.3, 5.3.4, 5.2.6, 5.1.6, and earlier, in the ESP-IDF Bluetooth host stack (BlueDroid), the function bta_dm_sdp_result() used a fixed-size array uuid_list[32][MAX_UUID_SIZE] to store discovered service UUIDs during the SDP (Service Discovery Protocol) process. On modern Bluetooth devices, it is possible for the number of available services to exceed this fixed limit (32). In such cases, if more than 32 services are discovered, subsequent writes to uuid_list could exceed the bounds of the array, resulting in a potential out-of-bounds write condition.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf","events":[{"introduced":"19b0d6c13cc6c558eb77d714fe239db05fbed44e"},{"last_affected":"fcae32885b0296b32044cb99ecbdc50d98dddb83"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"5.5-beta1"},{"last_affected":"5.5.1"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf","events":[{"introduced":"64b9d85a766f182c571fd1f515ce127dfcdc9a46"},{"last_affected":"ea1c174c1cbb7348bd8ba0ff1eb306246938dd80"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"5.4-beta1"},{"last_affected":"5.4.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf","events":[{"introduced":"ea010f84ef878dda07146244e166930738c1c103"},{"last_affected":"1b459d9c4950395dec12ce19256c73f9a41e306f"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"5.3-beta1"},{"last_affected":"5.3.4"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf","events":[{"introduced":"57bbfd423a1e9533d371a5e0e1e6bcec25bae6fc"},{"last_affected":"9ef24e3e2a2c96e720d83c574a3f8699177573da"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"5.2-beta1"},{"last_affected":"5.2.6"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"7452b1cb1d22cd1b439a6a922548efacea98ee72"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"5.1.6"}]}}],"versions":["v0.9","v1.0","v2.0-rc1","v2.1-rc1","v3.0-dev","v3.1-beta1","v3.1-dev","v3.2-beta1","v3.2-dev","v3.3-beta1","v3.3-beta2","v3.3-dev","v4.0-dev","v4.1-dev","v4.2-dev","v4.3-beta1","v4.3-dev","v4.4-dev","v5.0-beta1","v5.0-dev","v5.1","v5.1-beta1","v5.1-dev","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1.1","v5.1.2","v5.1.3","v5.1.4","v5.1.5","v5.1.6","v5.2","v5.2-beta1","v5.2-beta2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2.1","v5.2.2","v5.2.3","v5.2.4","v5.2.5","v5.2.6","v5.3","v5.3-beta1","v5.3-beta2","v5.3-rc1","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.3.3","v5.3.4","v5.4","v5.4-beta1","v5.4-beta2","v5.4-rc1","v5.4.1","v5.4.2","v5.4.3","v5.5","v5.5-beta1","v5.5.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68473.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68473.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/3286e45349b0b5c2b1422ef7e8d088b95eef895d"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/4d928f2265c394d2abc85024228e920a5b26bcab"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/5b3185168dae83d42aa0852689422fffd931f16c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/6453f57a954458ad8ffd6e4bf2d9e76b73fac0f1"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/6ca6f422dafaffcb88fa56cc458ce92d96be3b2e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/9889edd799cf369e082df9d01adba961d64693ed"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/ecb86d353640cf1375bf97db32e702ba59c551b6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/security/advisories/GHSA-hmjj-rjvv-w8pq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68473"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-787"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68473.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
