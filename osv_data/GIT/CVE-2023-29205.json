{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-29205","published":"2023-04-15T15:27:05Z","modified":"2025-10-29T13:32:33Z","aliases":["GHSA-vxf7-mx22-jr24"],"summary":"org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rendering-xwiki vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting via HTML and raw macro","details":"XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. The HTML macro does not systematically perform a proper neutralization of script-related html tags. As a result, any user able to use the html macro in XWiki, is able to introduce an XSS attack. This can be particularly dangerous since in a standard wiki, any user is able to use the html macro directly in their own user profile page. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.8RC1. The patch involves the HTML macros and are systematically cleaned up whenever the user does not have the script correct. \n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1194236d6104ade6659cd887e1bb9f3c10821e26"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-29205.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"3238ef965525b6aea7e3d912b5a1885aa985b222"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-29205.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-vxf7-mx22-jr24"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18568"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
