{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-38141","published":"2025-07-03T08:35:42.787Z","modified":"2025-11-20T09:30:49.643587Z","summary":"dm: fix dm_blk_report_zones","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm: fix dm_blk_report_zones\n\nIf dm_get_live_table() returned NULL, dm_put_live_table() was never\ncalled. Also, it is possible that md->zone_revalidate_map will change\nwhile calling this function. Only read it once, so that we are always\nusing the same value. Otherwise we might miss a call to\ndm_put_live_table().\n\nFinally, while md->zone_revalidate_map is set and a process is calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() to set up the zone append emulation\nresources, it is possible that another process, perhaps triggered by\nblkdev_report_zones_ioctl(), will call dm_blk_report_zones(). If\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, these resources can be freed while\nthe other process is still using them, causing a use-after-free error.\n\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will only ever be called when initially\nsetting up the zone append emulation resources, such as when setting up\na zoned dm-crypt table for the first time. Further table swaps will not\nset md->zone_revalidate_map or call blk_revalidate_disk_zones().\nHowever it must be called using the new table (referenced by\nmd->zone_revalidate_map) and the new queue limits while the DM device is\nsuspended. dm_blk_report_zones() needs some way to distinguish between a\ncall from blk_revalidate_disk_zones(), which must be allowed to use\nmd->zone_revalidate_map to access this not yet activated table, and all\nother calls to dm_blk_report_zones(), which should not be allowed while\nthe device is suspended and cannot use md->zone_revalidate_map, since\nthe zone resources might be freed by the process currently calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones().\n\nSolve this by tracking the process that sets md->zone_revalidate_map in\ndm_revalidate_zones() and only allowing that process to make use of it\nin dm_blk_report_zones().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"f211268ed1f9bdf48f06a3ead5f5d88437450579"},{"fixed":"f9c1bdf24615303d48a2d0fd629c88f3189563aa"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"f211268ed1f9bdf48f06a3ead5f5d88437450579"},{"fixed":"d19bc1b4dd5f322980b1f05f79b2ea4f0db10920"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"f211268ed1f9bdf48f06a3ead5f5d88437450579"},{"fixed":"37f53a2c60d03743e0eacf7a0c01c279776fef4e"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.15.1","v6.15.2","v6.9","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38141.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.10.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.34"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.15.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38141.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/37f53a2c60d03743e0eacf7a0c01c279776fef4e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d19bc1b4dd5f322980b1f05f79b2ea4f0db10920"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f9c1bdf24615303d48a2d0fd629c88f3189563aa"}]}
