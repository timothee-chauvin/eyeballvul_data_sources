In versions prior to 2.4.9, `oidc_validate_redirect_url()` does not parse URLs the same way as most browsers do. As a result, this function can be bypassed and leads to an Open Redirect vulnerability in the logout functionality. This bug has been fixed in version 2.4.9 by replacing any backslash of the URL to redirect with slashes to address a particular breaking change between the different specifications (RFC2396 / RFC3986 and WHATWG). As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by configuring `mod_auth_openidc` to only allow redirection whose destination matches a given regular expression.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/httpd","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7ea253ccfeaec99b5684c909dce6d9a6d7ee6486"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32786.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openidc/mod_auth_openidc","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3a115484eb927bc6daa5737dd84f88ff4bbc5544"},{"fixed":"e33cd488cb9ce027dae692e06767a0ba7ed5e1de"}]}],"versions":["2.3.11rc1","v1.5","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.10","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.8.5","v1.8.6","v1.8.7","v1.8.8","v1.8.9","v2.0.0","v2.0.0rc1","v2.0.0rc4","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.1.6","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.0rc0","v2.3.0rc3","v2.3.1","v2.3.10","v2.3.10.1","v2.3.10.2","v2.3.11","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.7","v2.3.8","v2.3.9","v2.4.0","v2.4.0.1","v2.4.0.2","v2.4.0.3","v2.4.0.4","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.2.1","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.4.1","v2.4.5","v2.4.6","v2.4.7","v2.4.7.1","v2.4.7.2","v2.4.8.1","v2.4.8.2","v2.4.8.3","v2.4.8.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32786.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00034.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FZVF6BSJLRQZ7PFFR4X5JSU6KUJYNOCU/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QXAWKPT5LXZSUTFSJ6IWSZC7RMYYQXQD/"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2017/01/30/one-url-standard-please/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/commit/3a115484eb927bc6daa5737dd84f88ff4bbc5544"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/releases/tag/v2.4.9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/security/advisories/GHSA-xm4c-5wm5-jqv7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210902-0001/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
