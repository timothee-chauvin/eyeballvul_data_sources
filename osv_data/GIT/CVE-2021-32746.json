{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-32746","published":"2021-07-12T23:15:07Z","modified":"2025-11-05T10:50:53.957863Z","related":["GHSA-cmgc-h4cx-3v43"],"details":"Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Between versions 2.3.0 and 2.8.2, the `doc` module of Icinga Web 2 allows to view documentation directly in the UI. It must be enabled manually by an administrator and users need explicit access permission to use it. Then, by visiting a certain route, it is possible to gain access to arbitrary files readable by the web-server user. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, an administrator may disable the `doc` module or revoke permission to use it from all users.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/icinga/icinga2","events":[{"introduced":"06ed955cb5bcc51179f92fbbd20303428208827b"},{"fixed":"292d71c43954bfbdcdab596520b6c0a3c7922ecd"}]}],"versions":["v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.8.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32746.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/icinga/icingaweb2","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"18996270b264976adf18d20da557d0c2806217c5"},{"fixed":"3b0a0a78df9389c46d3a74611a8eaec2f2b3cc77"},{"fixed":"479f990d5981354c05c362700117fe086cd048a9"}]}],"versions":["v1.0-11","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-beta1","v2.0.0-beta2","v2.0.0-beta3","v2.0.0-rc1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.4.0","v2.4.0-2","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v2.5.3","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.8.0","v2.8.0-rc1","v2.8.1","v2.8.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32746.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/releases/tag/v2.7.5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/releases/tag/v2.8.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/releases/tag/v2.9.0"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/security/advisories/GHSA-cmgc-h4cx-3v43"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
