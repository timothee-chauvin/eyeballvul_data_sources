{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2019-18792","published":"2020-01-06T18:15:23.183Z","modified":"2025-11-20T11:00:35.160940Z","details":"An issue was discovered in Suricata 5.0.0. It is possible to bypass/evade any tcp based signature by overlapping a TCP segment with a fake FIN packet. The fake FIN packet is injected just before the PUSH ACK packet we want to bypass. The PUSH ACK packet (containing the data) will be ignored by Suricata because it overlaps the FIN packet (the sequence and ack number are identical in the two packets). The client will ignore the fake FIN packet because the ACK flag is not set. Both linux and windows clients are ignoring the injected packet.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1c63d3905852f746ccde7e2585600b2199cefb4b"},{"fixed":"fa692df37a796c3330c81988d15ef1a219afc006"}]}],"versions":["suricata-0.8.2","suricata-1.0.0","suricata-1.0.1","suricata-1.0.2","suricata-1.1","suricata-1.1beta1","suricata-1.1beta2","suricata-1.1beta3","suricata-1.1rc1","suricata-1.2","suricata-1.2.1","suricata-1.2beta1","suricata-1.2rc1","suricata-1.3","suricata-1.3.1","suricata-1.3beta1","suricata-1.3beta2","suricata-1.3rc1","suricata-1.4","suricata-1.4beta1","suricata-1.4beta2","suricata-1.4beta3","suricata-1.4rc1","suricata-2.0","suricata-2.0.1","suricata-2.0.1rc1","suricata-2.0.2","suricata-2.0beta1","suricata-2.0beta2","suricata-2.0rc1","suricata-2.0rc2","suricata-2.0rc3","suricata-2.1beta1","suricata-2.1beta2","suricata-2.1beta3","suricata-2.1beta4","suricata-3.0","suricata-3.0.1","suricata-3.0.1RC1","suricata-3.0RC1","suricata-3.0RC2","suricata-3.0RC3","suricata-3.1","suricata-3.1.1","suricata-3.1.2","suricata-3.1RC1","suricata-3.2","suricata-3.2.1","suricata-3.2RC1","suricata-3.2beta1","suricata-4.0.0","suricata-4.0.0-beta1","suricata-4.0.0-rc1","suricata-4.0.0-rc2","suricata-4.0.1","suricata-4.1.0","suricata-4.1.0-beta1","suricata-4.1.0-rc1","suricata-4.1.0-rc2","suricata-4.1.1","suricata-4.1.2","suricata-4.1.3","suricata-4.1.4","suricata-4.1.5","suricata-5.0.0","suricata-5.0.0-beta1","suricata-5.0.0-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-18792.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["308058807450816276028635852746118275748","221204083360005168731164196304212191593","21390434416426577672697603659514546199","241751286558114224891527998751973942008","315659100405804393893208892637684634774","7013461576087916721718213038207716288","51532122097456985586895166914441882440","46556905094042848375660928505030236932"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2019-18792-1a417d03","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata/commit/1c63d3905852f746ccde7e2585600b2199cefb4b","target":{"file":"src/stream-tcp.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["308058807450816276028635852746118275748","221204083360005168731164196304212191593","21390434416426577672697603659514546199","241751286558114224891527998751973942008","315659100405804393893208892637684634774","7013461576087916721718213038207716288","51532122097456985586895166914441882440","46556905094042848375660928505030236932"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2019-18792-2c67d5b3","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata/commit/fa692df37a796c3330c81988d15ef1a219afc006","target":{"file":"src/stream-tcp.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"33221368742771496873975166895782756032","length":4675},"id":"CVE-2019-18792-63f7cd2e","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata/commit/fa692df37a796c3330c81988d15ef1a219afc006","target":{"file":"src/stream-tcp.c","function":"StreamTcpPacket"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"186385305067634872466018488430576115100","length":2066},"id":"CVE-2019-18792-c9346651","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata/commit/1c63d3905852f746ccde7e2585600b2199cefb4b","target":{"file":"src/stream-tcp.c","function":"StreamTcpTest10"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"186385305067634872466018488430576115100","length":2066},"id":"CVE-2019-18792-d25a80a0","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata/commit/fa692df37a796c3330c81988d15ef1a219afc006","target":{"file":"src/stream-tcp.c","function":"StreamTcpTest10"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"16861237037782119358511266195933336500","length":5058},"id":"CVE-2019-18792-eeaec1b8","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata/commit/1c63d3905852f746ccde7e2585600b2199cefb4b","target":{"file":"src/stream-tcp.c","function":"StreamTcpPacket"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/1c63d3905852f746ccde7e2585600b2199cefb4b"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/fa692df37a796c3330c81988d15ef1a219afc006"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/01/msg00032.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/3324"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/3394"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
