However, ns_update_nuse() calls kfree()\nfor the pointer even when nvme_identify_ns() fails. This results in\nKASAN double-free, which was observed with blktests nvme/045 with\nproposed patches [1] on the kernel v6.8-rc7. Fix the double-free by\nskipping kfree() when nvme_identify_ns() fails.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a1a825ab6a60380240ca136596732fdb80bad87a"},{"fixed":"534f9dc7fe495b3f9cc84363898ac50c5a25fccb"},{"fixed":"8d0d2447394b13fb22a069f0330f9c49b7fff9d3"}]}],"versions":["v6.7","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-27392.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.8.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-27392.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/534f9dc7fe495b3f9cc84363898ac50c5a25fccb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d0d2447394b13fb22a069f0330f9c49b7fff9d3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/27xxx/CVE-2024-27392.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27392"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/27xxx/CVE-2024-27392.json"}}
