The user interface may possibly be publicly accessible with umatiGateway's provided docker-compose file. With this access, the configuration can be viewed and altered. Commit 5d81a3412bc0051754a3095d89a06d6d743f2b16 uses `127.0.0.1:8080:8080` to limit access to the local network. For those who are unable to use this proposed patch, a firewall on Port 8080 may block remote access, but the workaround may not be perfect because Docker may also bypass a firewall by its iptable based rules for port forwarding.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/umati/umatigateway","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5d81a3412bc0051754a3095d89a06d6d743f2b16"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27615.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/security/advisories/GHSA-qf9w-x9qx-2mq7"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/commit/5d81a3412bc0051754a3095d89a06d6d743f2b16"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/pull/101"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/blob/abe73096a17307327f0d6dc0ed4db1fb93464521/README.md?plain=1#L34-L35"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H"}]}
