Where the fault address may be not aligned with the huge\npage size.  Then, copy_user_large_folio() may call\ncopy_user_gigantic_page() with the address, while\ncopy_user_gigantic_page() requires the address to be huge page size\naligned.  So, this may cause memory corruption or information leak,\naddtional, use more obvious naming 'addr_hint' instead of 'addr' for\ncopy_user_gigantic_page().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"530dd9926dc16220d2fae0997f45cda94f5f0864"},{"fixed":"cb12d61361ce769672c7c7bd32107252598cdd8b"},{"fixed":"f5d09de9f1bf9674c6418ff10d0a40cfe29268e1"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-51729.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.11.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-51729.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cb12d61361ce769672c7c7bd32107252598cdd8b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f5d09de9f1bf9674c6418ff10d0a40cfe29268e1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/51xxx/CVE-2024-51729.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51729"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/51xxx/CVE-2024-51729.json"}}
