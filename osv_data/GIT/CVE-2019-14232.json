If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods were passed the html=True argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression. The chars() and words() methods are used to implement the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters, which were thus vulnerable.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/django/django","events":[{"introduced":"c669cf279ae7b3e02a61db4fb077030a4db80e4f"},{"fixed":"974897759e9afc4cc56fb87e12319fa9697e93c9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-14232.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-08/msg00025.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/04/6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/04/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21topic/django-announce/jIoju2-KLDs"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/STVX7X7IDWAH5SKE6MBMY3TEI6ZODBTK/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Aug/15"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-08/msg00006.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/security/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-17"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190828-0002/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4498"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2019/aug/01/security-releases/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
