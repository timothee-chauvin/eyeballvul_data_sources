Due to an omission, this check is not performed when connecting with QUIC for HTTP/3, when the TLS backend is wolfSSL. Documentation says the option works with wolfSSL, failing to specify that it does not for QUIC and HTTP/3. Since pinning makes the transfer succeed if the pin is fine, users could unwittingly connect to an impostor server without noticing.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/curl/curl","events":[{"introduced":"7161cb17c01dcff1dc5bf89a18437d9d729f1ecd"},{"fixed":"4dacb79fcdd9364c1083e06f6a011d797a344f47"}]}],"versions":["curl-8_10_0","curl-8_10_1","curl-8_11_0","curl-8_11_1","curl-8_12_0","curl-8_12_1","curl-8_13_0","curl-8_5_0","curl-8_6_0","curl-8_7_0","curl-8_7_1","curl-8_8_0","curl-8_9_0","curl-8_9_1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-5025.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2025-5025.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2025-5025.json"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/3153497"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/28/5"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
