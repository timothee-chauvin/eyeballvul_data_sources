Currently the cxl_nvd is registered after the endpoint port probe.\nThe endpoint probe, in the case of autoassembly of regions, can cause a\npmem region probe requiring the not yet available cxl_nvd. Adjust the\nsequence so this dependency is met.\n\nThis requires adding a port parameter to cxl_find_nvdimm_bridge() that\ncan be used to query the ancestor root port. The endpoint port is not\nyet available, but will share a common ancestor with its parent, so\nstart the query from there instead.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"f17b558d6663101f876a1d9cbbad3de0c8f4ce4d"},{"fixed":"1d064e4fbebcf5b18dc10c1f3973487eb163b600"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"f17b558d6663101f876a1d9cbbad3de0c8f4ce4d"},{"fixed":"84ec985944ef34a34a1605b93ce401aa8737af96"}]}],"versions":["v6.1","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7","v6.9.1","v6.9.2","v6.9.3","v6.9.4","v6.9.5","v6.9.6","v6.9.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-41085.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.9.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-41085.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1d064e4fbebcf5b18dc10c1f3973487eb163b600"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/84ec985944ef34a34a1605b93ce401aa8737af96"}]}
