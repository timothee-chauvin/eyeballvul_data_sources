Example: ``` import { request } from 'undici' const unsanitizedContentTypeInput = 'application/json\\r\\n\\r\\nGET /foo2 HTTP/1.1' await request('http://localhost:3000, { method: 'GET', headers: { 'content-type': unsanitizedContentTypeInput }, }) ``` The above snippet will perform two requests in a single `request` API call: 1) `http://localhost:3000/` 2) `http://localhost:3000/foo2` This issue was patched in Undici v5.8.1. Sanitize input when sending content-type headers using user input as a workaround.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nodejs/undici","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"66165d604fd0aee70a93ed5c44ad4cc2df395f80"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.1.0","v3.0.0","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-alpha.0","v4.0.0-alpha.1","v4.0.0-alpha.2","v4.0.0-alpha.4","v4.0.0-alpha.5","v4.0.0-rc.1","v4.0.0-rc.2","v4.0.0-rc.3","v4.0.0-rc.4","v4.0.0-rc.5","v4.0.0-rc.7","v4.0.0-rc.8","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.10.0","v4.10.1","v4.10.2","v4.10.3","v4.10.4","v4.11.0","v4.11.1","v4.11.2","v4.11.3","v4.12.0","v4.12.2","v4.13.0","v4.14.0","v4.14.1","v4.15.0","v4.15.1","v4.16.0","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.4.1","v4.4.2","v4.4.3","v4.4.4","v4.4.5","v4.4.6","v4.4.7","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.6.0","v4.7.0","v4.7.1","v4.7.2","v4.7.3","v4.8.0","v4.8.1","v4.8.2","v4.9.0","v4.9.1","v4.9.2","v4.9.3","v4.9.4","v4.9.5","v5.0.0","v5.1.0","v5.1.1","v5.2.0","v5.3.0","v5.4.0","v5.5.0","v5.5.1","v5.6.0","v5.6.1","v5.7.0","v5.8.0","v5.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35948.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/35xxx/CVE-2022-35948.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nodejs/undici/commit/66165d604fd0aee70a93ed5c44ad4cc2df395f80"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nodejs/undici/releases/tag/v5.8.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nodejs/undici/security/advisories/GHSA-f772-66g8-q5h3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35948"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-74","CWE-93"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/35xxx/CVE-2022-35948.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
