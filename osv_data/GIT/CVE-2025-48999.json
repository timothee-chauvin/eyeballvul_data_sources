A bypass of CVE-2025-46566's patch exists in versions prior to 2.10.10. In a malicious payload, `getUrlType()` retrieves `hostName`. Since the judgment statement returns false, it will not enter the if statement and will not be filtered. The payload can be directly concatenated at the replace location to construct a malicious JDBC statement. Version 2.10.10 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dataease/dataease","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3b8f018abb6d3846a7ebb694bbe5cbf35a932104"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.10.2","v2.10.3","v2.10.4","v2.10.5","v2.10.6","v2.10.7","v2.10.8","v2.10.9","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.6.0","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48999.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/dataease/dataease/commit/03b18db8a0fb7e9dc2c44f6d26d8c6221b7748c4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/dataease/dataease/security/advisories/GHSA-6pq2-6q8x-mp2r"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-284","CWE-923"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
