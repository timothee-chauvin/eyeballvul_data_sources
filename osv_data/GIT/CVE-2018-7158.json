The code in question was replaced in Node.js 6.x and later so this vulnerability only impacts all versions of Node.js 4.x. The regular expression, `splitPathRe`, used within the `'path'` module for the various path parsing functions, including `path.dirname()`, `path.extname()` and `path.parse()` was structured in such a way as to allow an attacker to craft a string, that when passed through one of these functions, could take a significant amount of time to evaluate, potentially leading to a full denial of service.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nodejs/node","events":[{"introduced":"f9f837885343a2a3f5ba2b8c510eaac395c8c865"},{"last_affected":"85df6ada477715020dbd22e2fb5e687d84d663ff"},{"introduced":"6dc12b1042d5d4727f77e8a1c5758dab91400069"},{"last_affected":"b8eef6d10bf45a4d659a84d670dbf3afff0250a2"}]}],"versions":["v4.0.0","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-7158.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
