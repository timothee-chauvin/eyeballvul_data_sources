In RSSHub before version 7f1c430 (non-semantic versioning) there is a risk of code injection. Some routes use `eval` or `Function constructor`, which may be injected by the target site with unsafe code, causing server-side security issues The fix in version 7f1c430 is to temporarily remove the problematic route and added a `no-new-func` rule to eslint.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/diygod/rsshub","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7f1c43094e8a82e4d8f036ff7d42568fed00699d"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-21278.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/commit/7f1c43094e8a82e4d8f036ff7d42568fed00699d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/security/advisories/GHSA-pgjj-866w-fc5c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/rsshub"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
