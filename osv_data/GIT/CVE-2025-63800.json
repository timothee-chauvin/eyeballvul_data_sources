{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-63800","published":"2025-11-18T16:15:46.310Z","modified":"2025-12-21T06:43:43.931906Z","details":"The password change endpoint in Open Source Point of Sale 3.4.1 allows users to set their account password to an empty string due to missing server-side validation. When an authenticated user omits or leaves the `password` and `repeat_password` parameters empty in the password change request, the backend still returns a successful response and sets the password to an empty string. This effectively disables authentication and may allow unauthorized access to user or administrative accounts.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"5f395d987b02562092b838073cb2e23a22d2bca4"}]}],"versions":["2.3.1","2.3.2","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.4.0","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.3.2","3.3.3","3.3.4","3.3.5","3.3.6","3.3.7","3.3.8","3.3.9","3.4.0","3.4.1","master.3.3.5","master.3.3.6","master.3.4.0-dev"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-63800.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://opensourcepos.org/"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/omkaryepre/vulnerability-research/tree/main/CVE-2025-63800"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
