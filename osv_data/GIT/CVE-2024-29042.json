{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-29042","published":"2024-03-22T16:46:21.456Z","modified":"2025-12-07T10:05:53.647386Z","aliases":["GHSA-882j-4vj5-7vmj"],"summary":"Translate Cache Poisoning Vulnerability","details":"Translate is a package that allows users to convert text to different languages on Node.js and the browser. Prior to version 3.0.0, an attacker controlling the second variable of the `translate` function is able to perform a cache poisoning attack. They can change the outcome of translation requests made by subsequent users. The `opt.id` parameter allows the overwriting of the cache key. If an attacker sets the `id` variable to the cache key that would be generated by another user, they can choose the response that user gets served. Version 3.0.0 fixes this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/franciscop/translate","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"794b8d9c546e225f6e0d6d9f2c5531ed697439c4"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-29042.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/29xxx/CVE-2024-29042.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/franciscop/translate/commit/7a2bf8b9f05f7c45c09683973ef4d8e995804aa4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/franciscop/translate/commit/cc1ba03078102f83e0503a96f1a081489bb865d3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/franciscop/translate/security/advisories/GHSA-882j-4vj5-7vmj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29042"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-20"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/29xxx/CVE-2024-29042.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
