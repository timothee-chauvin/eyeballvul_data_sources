Completing the attack would cost more than a million dollars, and is relevant mainly only in situations where an autonomous system relies solely on an SPV proof for transactions of a greater dollar amount.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"43a987c1cbcd04b9c59052606c3c31c56abc826e"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-12842.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2018/06/09/leaf-node-weakness-in-bitcoin-merkle-tree-design/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-February/016697.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
