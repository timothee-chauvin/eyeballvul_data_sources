Prior to version 1.5.10.15, due to a lack of request sanitization in the logs, a malicious request containing XSS would be stored in a log file. When an administrator of the FOG server logged in and viewed the logs, they would be parsed as HTML and displayed accordingly. Version 1.5.10.15 contains a patch. As a workaround, view logs from an external text editor rather than the dashboard.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/fogproject/fogproject","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2e2421f19620669b9930f72fb73a8dbc5efe4980"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-46235.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/security/advisories/GHSA-cvf7-7mvq-5694"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/commit/2e2421f19620669b9930f72fb73a8dbc5efe4980"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79","CWE-80"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
