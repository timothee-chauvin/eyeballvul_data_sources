  "details": "xwiki-platform-icon-ui is vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection'). Any user with view rights on commonly accessible documents including the icon picker macro can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki due to improper neutralization of the macro parameters of the icon picker macro. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.7, 14.5 and 14.4.2. Workarounds: The [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/47eb8a5fba550f477944eb6da8ca91b87eaf1d01) can be manually applied by editing `IconThemesCode.IconPickerMacro` in the object editor. The whole document can also be replaced by the current version by importing the document from the XAR archive of a fixed version as the only changes to the document have been security fixes and small formatting changes.",
