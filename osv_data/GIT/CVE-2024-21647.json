Prior to version 6.4.2, puma exhibited incorrect behavior when parsing chunked transfer encoding bodies in a way that allowed HTTP request smuggling. Fixed versions limits the size of chunk extensions. Without this limit, an attacker could cause unbounded resource (CPU, network bandwidth) consumption. This vulnerability has been fixed in versions 6.4.2 and 5.6.8.\n\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/puma/puma","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"129357322e837e7d99c25c9cd71d36ecb4f9540b"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/puma/puma","events":[{"introduced":"32d999708d7019b85b0518c8e0693773b0bd4ff4"},{"fixed":"5fc43d73b6ff193325e657a24ed76dec79133e93"}]}],"versions":["rm","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.2","v2.0.0","v2.0.0.b2","v2.0.0.b3","v2.0.0.b4","v2.0.0.b5","v2.0.0.b6","v2.0.0.b7","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.10.2","v2.11.0","v2.11.2","v2.11.3","v2.12.0","v2.12.1","v2.12.2","v2.12.3","v2.13.0","v2.13.1","v2.13.2","v2.13.3","v2.13.4","v2.14.0","v2.15.0","v2.15.1","v2.15.2","v2.15.3","v2.16.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v2.9.2","v3.0.0","v3.0.0.rc1","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.10.0","v3.11.0","v3.11.1","v3.11.2","v3.11.3","v3.11.4","v3.12.0","v3.12.1","v3.2.0","v3.3.0","v3.4.0","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.6.0","v3.7.1","v3.8.0","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.1.0","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.3.0","v5.0.0","v5.0.0.beta1","v5.0.0.beta2","v5.0.1","v5.0.2","v5.0.3","v5.1.0","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.2.2","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.4.0","v5.5.0","v5.5.1","v5.5.2","v5.6.0","v5.6.1","v5.6.2","v5.6.4","v5.6.5","v5.6.6","v5.6.7","v6.0.0","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.1.0","v6.2.0","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.3.0","v6.4.0","v6.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-21647.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-c2f4-cvqm-65w2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/puma/puma/commit/5fc43d73b6ff193325e657a24ed76dec79133e93"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-444"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
