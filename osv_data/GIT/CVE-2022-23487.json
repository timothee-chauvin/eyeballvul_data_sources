{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-23487","published":"2022-12-07T20:05:35.319Z","modified":"2025-11-20T21:13:10.774762Z","aliases":["GHSA-f44q-634c-jvwv"],"summary":"libp2p denial of service vulnerability from lack of resource management","details":"js-libp2p is the official javascript Implementation of libp2p networking stack. Versions older than `v0.38.0` of js-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p’s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host’s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within manageable limits has been part of js-libp2p, this component was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack. Users are advised to update their js-libp2p dependency to `v0.38.0` or greater. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"88ae97914e1708f2e7714104ca1d921bb9073c80"}]}],"versions":["gx/v1.0.0","gx/v2.0.1","gx/v2.0.2","gx/v2.0.3","gx/v3.0.0","gx/v3.1.0","gx/v3.2.0","gx/v3.2.1","gx/v3.2.2","gx/v3.2.3","gx/v3.3.0","gx/v3.3.1","gx/v3.3.2","gx/v3.3.3","gx/v3.3.4","gx/v3.3.6","gx/v3.3.7","gx/v3.4.0","gx/v3.4.1","gx/v3.4.2","gx/v3.4.3","gx/v3.5.0","gx/v3.5.1","gx/v3.5.2","gx/v3.5.3","gx/v3.5.4","gx/v3.6.0","gx/v4.0.0","gx/v4.0.1","gx/v4.0.2","gx/v4.0.3","gx/v4.0.4","gx/v4.1.0","gx/v4.2.0","gx/v4.3.0","gx/v4.3.1","gx/v4.3.10","gx/v4.3.11","gx/v4.3.12","gx/v4.3.2","gx/v4.3.3","gx/v4.3.4","gx/v4.3.5","gx/v4.3.6","gx/v4.3.7","gx/v4.3.8","gx/v4.3.9","gx/v4.4.0","gx/v4.4.1","gx/v4.4.2","gx/v4.4.3","gx/v4.4.4","gx/v4.4.5","gx/v4.5.0","gx/v4.5.1","gx/v4.5.2","gx/v4.5.3","gx/v4.5.4","gx/v4.5.5","gx/v5.0.0","gx/v5.0.1","gx/v5.0.10","gx/v5.0.11","gx/v5.0.12","gx/v5.0.13","gx/v5.0.14","gx/v5.0.15","gx/v5.0.16","gx/v5.0.17","gx/v5.0.18","gx/v5.0.19","gx/v5.0.2","gx/v5.0.20","gx/v5.0.21","gx/v5.0.3","gx/v5.0.4","gx/v5.0.5","gx/v5.0.6","gx/v5.0.7","gx/v5.0.8","gx/v5.0.9","gx/v6.0.0","gx/v6.0.1","gx/v6.0.10","gx/v6.0.11","gx/v6.0.12","gx/v6.0.13","gx/v6.0.14","gx/v6.0.15","gx/v6.0.16","gx/v6.0.17","gx/v6.0.18","gx/v6.0.19","gx/v6.0.2","gx/v6.0.20","gx/v6.0.21","gx/v6.0.22","gx/v6.0.23","gx/v6.0.29","gx/v6.0.3","gx/v6.0.4","gx/v6.0.5","gx/v6.0.6","gx/v6.0.7","gx/v6.0.8","gx/v6.0.9","v0.0.1","v0.0.10","v0.0.11","v0.0.12","v0.0.13","v0.0.14","v0.0.15","v0.0.16","v0.0.17","v0.0.18","v0.0.19","v0.0.2","v0.0.20","v0.0.21","v0.0.22","v0.0.23","v0.0.24","v0.0.25","v0.0.26","v0.0.27","v0.0.28","v0.0.29","v0.0.3","v0.0.30","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.10.3","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.14.4","v0.15.0-rc.1","v0.16.0","v0.16.0-dev","v0.17.0","v0.18.0","v0.18.0-rc1","v0.18.0-rc2","v0.18.0-rc3","v0.18.0-rc4","v0.18.0-rc5","v0.18.0-rc6","v0.19.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.20.0","v0.21.0","v0.21.0-rc","v0.22.0","v0.23.0","v0.23.1","v0.23.2","v0.24.0","v0.24.0-dev","v0.24.1","v0.24.2","v0.25.0","v0.25.1","v0.26.0","v0.26.1","v0.27.0","v0.27.1","v0.28.0","v0.29.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.30.0","v0.31.0","v0.32.0","v0.32.1","v0.33.0","v0.34.0","v0.34.1","v0.35.0","v0.36.0","v0.36.1","v0.36.2","v0.37.0","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.5","v0.9.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23487.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"29c803a63e5aacda1e5b87527b15bf27b31ea5a6"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.12.2","v0.12.3","v0.12.4","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.13.3","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.16.3","v0.16.4","v0.16.5","v0.17.0","v0.18.0","v0.19.0","v0.19.2","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.20.4","v0.21.0","v0.22.0","v0.23.0","v0.23.1","v0.24.0","v0.24.0-rc.3","v0.24.1","v0.24.2","v0.24.3","v0.24.4","v0.25.0","v0.25.0-rc.0","v0.25.0-rc.1","v0.25.0-rc.2","v0.25.0-rc.3","v0.25.0-rc.4","v0.25.0-rc.5","v0.25.0-rc.6","v0.25.1","v0.25.2","v0.25.3","v0.25.4","v0.25.5","v0.26.0","v0.26.0-rc.0","v0.26.0-rc.1","v0.26.0-rc.2","v0.26.0-rc.3","v0.26.1","v0.26.2","v0.27.0","v0.27.1","v0.27.2","v0.27.3","v0.27.4","v0.27.5","v0.27.6","v0.27.7","v0.27.8","v0.28.0","v0.28.0-rc.0","v0.28.1","v0.28.10","v0.28.2","v0.28.3","v0.28.4","v0.28.5","v0.28.6","v0.28.7","v0.28.8","v0.28.9","v0.29.0","v0.29.1","v0.29.2","v0.29.3","v0.29.4","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.30.0","v0.30.1","v0.30.10","v0.30.11","v0.30.12","v0.30.2","v0.30.3","v0.30.4","v0.30.5","v0.30.6","v0.30.7","v0.30.8","v0.30.9","v0.31.0","v0.31.0-rc.0","v0.31.0-rc.1","v0.31.0-rc.2","v0.31.0-rc.3","v0.31.0-rc.4","v0.31.0-rc.5","v0.31.0-rc.6","v0.31.0-rc.7","v0.31.1","v0.31.2","v0.31.3","v0.31.4","v0.31.5","v0.31.6","v0.31.7","v0.32.0","v0.32.0-rc.0","v0.32.1","v0.32.2","v0.32.3","v0.32.4","v0.32.5","v0.33.0","v0.34.0","v0.35.0","v0.35.1","v0.35.2","v0.35.3","v0.35.4","v0.35.5","v0.35.6","v0.35.7","v0.35.8","v0.36.0","v0.36.1","v0.36.2","v0.37.0","v0.37.1","v0.37.2","v0.37.3","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v0.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23487.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0b7ee3fa924e97e75b12b07e4ccb5ca8f5efc44c"}]}],"versions":["0.13.2","libp2p-core-0.19.2","libp2p-core-0.20.0",
