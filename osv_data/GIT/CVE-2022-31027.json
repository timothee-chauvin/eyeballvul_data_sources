{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-31027","published":"2022-06-06T21:15:12Z","modified":"2025-12-04T10:22:30.963273Z","aliases":["GHSA-r7v4-jwx9-wx43","PYSEC-2022-206"],"summary":"Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key when using CILogonOAuthenticator in oauthenticator","details":"OAuthenticator is an OAuth token library for the JupyerHub login handler. CILogonOAuthenticator is provided by the OAuthenticator package, and lets users log in to a JupyterHub via CILogon. This is primarily used to restrict a JupyterHub only to users of a given institute. The allowed_idps configuration trait of CILogonOAuthenticator is documented to be a list of domains that indicate the institutions whose users are authorized to access this JupyterHub. This authorization is validated by ensuring that the *email* field provided to us by CILogon has a *domain* that matches one of the domains listed in `allowed_idps`.If `allowed_idps` contains `berkeley.edu`, you might expect only users with valid current credentials provided by University of California, Berkeley to be able to access the JupyterHub. However, CILogonOAuthenticator does *not* verify which provider is used by the user to login, only the email address provided. So a user can login with a GitHub account that has email set to `<something>@berkeley.edu`, and that will be treated exactly the same as someone logging in using the UC Berkeley official Identity Provider. The patch fixing this issue makes a *breaking change* in how `allowed_idps` is interpreted. It's no longer a list of domains, but configuration representing the `EntityID` of the IdPs that are allowed, picked from the [list maintained by CILogon](https://cilogon.org/idplist/). Users are advised to upgrade.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3f2e05f8cd1d78c6a70cc44d7dbfe5fdcb152f30"}]}],"versions":["0.10.0","0.11.0","0.12.0","0.12.1","0.12.3","0.13.0","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.8.2","14.0.0","14.1.0","14.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31027.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/31xxx/CVE-2022-31027.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/security/advisories/GHSA-r7v4-jwx9-wx43"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31027"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-639"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/31xxx/CVE-2022-31027.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
