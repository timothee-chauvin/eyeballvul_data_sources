Before version 2.29.0, this also included the Log4J2 MBean. This MBean is not meant for exposure to non-administrative users. This could eventually allow an authenticated attacker to write arbitrary files to the filesystem and indirectly achieve RCE.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.29.0 or later, which fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2be5c54cd0321a5bf7e711f2eb6e096a276e9604"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.5.1","2.0.0","2.1.0","2.10.0","2.10.1","2.11.0","2.12.0","2.13.0","2.14.0","2.15.0","2.16.0","2.17.0","2.18.0","2.19.0","2.2.0","2.20.0","2.21.0","2.22.0","2.23.0","2.24.0","2.25.0","2.26.0","2.27.0","2.28.0","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.5.0","2.6.0","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-50780.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/10/14/2"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread/63b78shqz312phsx7v1ryr7jv7bprg58"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
