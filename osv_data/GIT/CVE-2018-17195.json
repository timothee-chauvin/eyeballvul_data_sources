{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2018-17195","published":"2018-12-19T14:29:00Z","modified":"2025-10-21T04:31:38.320011Z","aliases":["GHSA-3jq8-jg75-rqv6"],"details":"The template upload API endpoint accepted requests from different domain when sent in conjunction with ARP spoofing + man in the middle (MiTM) attack, resulting in a CSRF attack. The required attack vector is complex, requiring a scenario with client certificate authentication, same subnet access, and injecting malicious code into an unprotected (plaintext HTTP) website which the targeted user later visits, but the possible damage warranted a Severe severity level. Mitigation: The fix to apply Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy request filtering was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.8.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/nifi","events":[{"introduced":"74d5224783dfdc513f6b3ad5ed96671d3c581707"},{"last_affected":"241e5411a24435ca2c39ab7bea1c5eb9ed195cb3"}]}],"versions":["docker/nifi-1.2.0","nifi-1.0.0-RC1","nifi-1.1.0-RC2","nifi-1.2.0-RC2","nifi-1.3.0-RC1","nifi-1.5.0-RC1","nifi-1.6.0-RC3","nifi-1.7.0-RC1","nifi-1.7.1-RC1","rel/nifi-1.0.0","rel/nifi-1.1.0","rel/nifi-1.2.0","rel/nifi-1.3.0","rel/nifi-1.4.0","rel/nifi-1.5.0","rel/nifi-1.6.0","rel/nifi-1.7.0","rel/nifi-1.7.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-17195.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nifi.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2018-17195"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
