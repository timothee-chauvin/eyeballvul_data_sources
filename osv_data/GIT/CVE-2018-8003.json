Direct network access to the Ambari Server is required to issue this request, and those Ambari Servers that are protected behind a firewall, or in a restricted network zone are at less risk of being affected by this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/ambari","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"207a8e3c6b58feef25cea171c9dd8cce276e02fa"}]}],"versions":["release-2.4.0","release-2.4.0-rc0","release-2.5.0","release-2.5.0-rc0","release-2.5.0-rc1","release-2.5.0-rc2","release-2.5.1","release-2.5.1-rc0","release-2.6.0","release-2.6.0-rc0","release-2.6.1","release-2.6.1-rc0","release-2.6.1-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-8003.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104161"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/Ambari+Vulnerabilities#AmbariVulnerabilities-CVE-2018-8003"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
