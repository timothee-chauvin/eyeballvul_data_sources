{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-38224","published":"2025-07-04T13:37:39Z","modified":"2025-10-22T13:22:23.239701Z","summary":"can: kvaser_pciefd: refine error prone echo_skb_max handling logic","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: kvaser_pciefd: refine error prone echo_skb_max handling logic\n\necho_skb_max should define the supported upper limit of echo_skb[]\nallocated inside the netdevice's priv. The corresponding size value\nprovided by this driver to alloc_candev() is KVASER_PCIEFD_CAN_TX_MAX_COUNT\nwhich is 17.\n\nBut later echo_skb_max is rounded up to the nearest power of two (for the\nmax case, that would be 32) and the tx/ack indices calculated further\nduring tx/rx may exceed the upper array boundary. Kasan reported this for\nthe ack case inside kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet(), though the xmit\nfunction has actually caught the same thing earlier.\n\n BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet+0x2d7/0x92a drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1528\n Read of size 8 at addr ffff888105e4f078 by task swapper/4/0\n\n CPU: 4 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/4 Not tainted 6.15.0 #12 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n Call Trace:\n  <IRQ>\n dump_stack_lvl lib/dump_stack.c:122\n print_report mm/kasan/report.c:521\n kasan_report mm/kasan/report.c:634\n kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1528\n kvaser_pciefd_read_packet drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1605\n kvaser_pciefd_read_buffer drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1656\n kvaser_pciefd_receive_irq drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1684\n kvaser_pciefd_irq_handler drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1733\n __handle_irq_event_percpu kernel/irq/handle.c:158\n handle_irq_event kernel/irq/handle.c:210\n handle_edge_irq kernel/irq/chip.c:833\n __common_interrupt arch/x86/kernel/irq.c:296\n common_interrupt arch/x86/kernel/irq.c:286\n  </IRQ>\n\nTx max count definitely matters for kvaser_pciefd_tx_avail(), but for seq\nnumbers' generation that's not the case - we're free to calculate them as\nwould be more convenient, not taking tx max count into account. The only\ndownside is that the size of echo_skb[] should correspond to the max seq\nnumber (not tx max count), so in some situations a bit more memory would\nbe consumed than could be.\n\nThus make the size of the underlying echo_skb[] sufficient for the rounded\nmax tx value.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with
