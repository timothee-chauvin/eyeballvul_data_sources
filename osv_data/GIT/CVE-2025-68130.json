Starting in version 10.27.0 and prior to versions 10.45.3 and 11.8.0, a A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in `@trpc/server`'s `formDataToObject` function, which is used by the Next.js App Router adapter. An attacker can pollute `Object.prototype` by submitting specially crafted FormData field names, potentially leading to authorization bypass, denial of service, or other security impacts. Note that this vulnerability is only present when using `experimental_caller` / `experimental_nextAppDirCaller`. Versions 10.45.3 and 11.8.0 fix the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/trpc/trpc","events":[{"introduced":"e6c8ff151ba15273361e9df233fe17b7d0f6db36"},{"fixed":"1117bb317ac2c146c571c170cbf3b4cc1827e4cf"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"10.27.0"},{"fixed":"10.45.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/trpc/trpc","events":[{"introduced":"85841a1ae4679847fd29ad5454c1a584a2e206d2"},{"fixed":"a247ce28817ea682f3ffda9255678db18a8b3391"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"11.0.0"},{"fixed":"11.8.0"}]}}],"versions":["v10.27.0","v10.27.1","v10.27.2","v10.27.3","v10.28.0","v10.28.1","v10.28.2","v10.29.0","v10.29.1","v10.30.0","v10.31.0","v10.32.0","v10.33.0","v10.33.1","v10.34.0","v10.34.1","v10.35.0","v10.36.0","v10.37.0","v10.37.1","v10.38.0","v10.38.1","v10.38.2","v10.38.3","v10.38.4","v10.38.5","v10.39.0","v10.40.0","v10.41.0","v10.42.0","v10.43.0","v10.43.1","v10.43.2","v10.43.3","v10.43.4","v10.43.5","v10.43.6","v10.43.7","v10.44.0","v10.44.1","v10.45.0","v10.45.1","v10.45.2","v11.0.0","v11.0.1","v11.0.2","v11.0.3","v11.0.4","v11.1.0","v11.1.1","v11.1.2","v11.1.3","v11.1.4","v11.2.0","v11.3.0","v11.3.1","v11.4.0","v11.4.1","v11.4.2","v11.4.3","v11.4.4","v11.5.0","v11.5.1","v11.6.0","v11.7.0","v11.7.1","v11.7.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68130.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68130.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/trpc/trpc/security/advisories/GHSA-43p4-m455-4f4j"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68130"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-1321"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68130.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:H/VA:L/SC:L/SI:H/SA:L"}]}
