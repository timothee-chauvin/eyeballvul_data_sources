Prior to version 1.13.8, an attacker can send a message with evil sdp to FreeSWITCH, which may cause crash. This type of crash may be caused by `#define MATCH(s, m) (strncmp(s, m, n = sizeof(m) - 1) == 0)`, which will make `n` bigger and trigger out-of-bound access when `IS_NON_WS(s[n])`. Version 1.13.8 contains a patch for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"756ab9b5c9370423489e0d6a27166863c7a57fef"}]}],"versions":["v1.13.2","v1.13.3","v1.13.4","v1.13.5","v1.13.6","v1.13.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31001.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/commit/a99804b336d0e16d26ab7119d56184d2d7110a36"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/security/advisories/GHSA-79jq-hh82-cv9g"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00001.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-18"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5410"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-125"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
