{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-29913","published":"2025-03-17T22:50:49.074Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:35:16.050332Z","aliases":["GHSA-q4v2-fvrv-qrf6"],"summary":"CryptoLib's Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD Has Buffer Overflow Due to Integer Underflow","details":"CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in the `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted telecommand (TC) frame that causes an unsigned integer underflow. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD`, specifically during the computation of `tc_mac_start_index`. The affected code incorrectly calculates the MAC start index without ensuring it remains within the bounds of the `ingest` buffer. When `tc_mac_start_index` underflows due to an incorrect length calculation, the function attempts to access an out-of-bounds memory location, leading to a segmentation fault. The vulnerability is still present in the repository as of commit `d3cc420ace96d02a5b7e83d88cbd2e48010d5723`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nasa/cryptolib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0d58c9a8cb9f7e96d67858d7ac125daaec0ca299"}]}],"versions":["v0.1-engineering-release","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-29913.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-q4v2-fvrv-qrf6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-125","CWE-191"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
