Prior to versions 2.30.9, 2.31.8, 2.32.7, 2.33.8, 2.34.8, 2.35.8, 2.36.6, 2.37.7, 2.38.5, 2.39.3, and 2.40.1, by feeding specially crafted input to `git apply --reject`, a path outside the working tree can be overwritten with partially controlled contents (corresponding to the rejected hunk(s) from the given patch). A fix is available in versions 2.30.9, 2.31.8, 2.32.7, 2.33.8, 2.34.8, 2.35.8, 2.36.6, 2.37.7, 2.38.5, 2.39.3, and 2.40.1. As a workaround, avoid using `git apply` with `--reject` when applying patches from an untrusted source. Use `git apply --stat` to inspect a patch before applying; avoid applying one that create a conflict where a link corresponding to the `*.rej` file exists.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/git/git","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"18e2b1cfc80990719275d7b08e6e50f3e8cbc902"},{"fixed":"668f2d53613ac8fd373926ebe219f2c29112d93e"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-25652.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"469fcac0990381aa6d656f5b02924482b91e0ce5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-25652.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/25/2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/git/git/commit/18e2b1cfc80990719275d7b08e6e50f3e8cbc902"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/git/git/commit/668f2d53613ac8fd373926ebe219f2c29112d93e"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-2hvf-7c8p-28fx"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00018.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/09/msg00009.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BSXOGVVBJLYX26IAYX6PJSYQB36BREWH/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PI7FZ4NNR5S5J5K6AMVQBH2JFP6NE4L7/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RKOXOAZ42HLXHXTW6JZI4L5DAIYDTYCU/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YFZWGQKB6MM5MNF2DLFTD7KS2KWPICKL/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
