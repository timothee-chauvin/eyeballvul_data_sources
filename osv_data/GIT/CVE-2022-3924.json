If there are sufficient clients already waiting when a new client query is received so that it is necessary to SERVFAIL the longest waiting client (see BIND 9 ARM `recursive-clients` limit and soft quota), then it is possible for a race to occur between providing a stale answer to this older client and sending an early timeout SERVFAIL, which may cause an assertion failure.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.12 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.12-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/bind9","events":[{"introduced":"aeb943df66f7db58fa7ff814a84fd25b8a6c8379"},{"fixed":"2b2afb28abf4fb235ce0e9b1245cb673622c7dff"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-3924.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/isc-projects/bind9","events":[{"introduced":"8db45afa1affcb823e68afdeddedf93e136f5d3e"},{"fixed":"1f554acee8df440c2fc211f976b196b31b9c9284"}]}],"versions":["v9.18.0","v9.18.10","v9.18.2","v9.18.3","v9.18.4","v9.18.5","v9.18.6","v9.18.7","v9.18.8","v9.18.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-3924.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2022-3924"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
