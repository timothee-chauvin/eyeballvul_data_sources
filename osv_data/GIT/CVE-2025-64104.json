Prior to 2.0.11, LangGraph's SQLite store implementation contains SQL injection vulnerabilities using direct string concatenation without proper parameterization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL and bypass access controls. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.0.11.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bc9d45b476101e441cb1cc602dea03eb29232de4"}]}],"versions":["0.1.10","0.1.11","0.1.12","0.1.13","0.1.14","0.1.15","0.1.16","0.1.17","0.1.2","0.1.3","0.1.4","0.1.5","0.1.6","0.1.7","0.1.8","0.1.9","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.10","0.2.11","0.2.12","0.2.13","0.2.15","0.2.16","0.2.17","0.2.18","0.2.19","0.2.2","0.2.20","0.2.21","0.2.22","0.2.23","0.2.24","0.2.25","0.2.26","0.2.27","0.2.28","0.2.29","0.2.3","0.2.30","0.2.31","0.2.32","0.2.33","0.2.34","0.2.35","0.2.36","0.2.37","0.2.38","0.2.39","0.2.4","0.2.40","0.2.41","0.2.42","0.2.43","0.2.44","0.2.45","0.2.46","0.2.47","0.2.48","0.2.49","0.2.5","0.2.50","0.2.51","0.2.52","0.2.53","0.2.54","0.2.55","0.2.56","0.2.57","0.2.58","0.2.59","0.2.6","0.2.60","0.2.61","0.2.62","0.2.63","0.2.64","0.2.65","0.2.66","0.2.67","0.2.68","0.2.69","0.2.7","0.2.70","0.2.71","0.2.72","0.2.73","0.2.74","0.2.75","0.2.76","0.2.9","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.10","0.3.11","0.3.12","0.3.13","0.3.14","0.3.15","0.3.16","0.3.17","0.3.18","0.3.19","0.3.2","0.3.20","0.3.21","0.3.22","0.3.23","0.3.24","0.3.25","0.3.26","0.3.27","0.3.28","0.3.29","0.3.3","0.3.30","0.3.31","0.3.32","0.3.34","0.3.4","0.3.5","0.3.6","0.3.7","0.3.8","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.4.3","0.4.4","0.4.5","0.4.6","0.4.7","0.5.0","0.5.0rc0","0.5.0rc1","0.5.1","0.5.2","0.5.3","0.5.4","0.6.0a1","checkpoint==1.0.0","checkpoint==1.0.1","checkpoint==1.0.10","checkpoint==1.0.11","checkpoint==1.0.12","checkpoint==1.0.13","checkpoint==1.0.14","checkpoint==1.0.2","checkpoint==1.0.3","checkpoint==1.0.4","checkpoint==1.0.7","checkpoint==1.0.8","checkpoint==1.0.9","checkpoint==2.0.0","checkpoint==2.0.1","checkpoint==2.0.10","checkpoint==2.0.12","checkpoint==2.0.13","checkpoint==2.0.14","checkpoint==2.0.15","checkpoint==2.0.16","checkpoint==2.0.17","checkpoint==2.0.18","checkpoint==2.0.19","checkpoint==2.0.2","checkpoint==2.0.20","checkpoint==2.0.21","checkpoint==2.0.22","checkpoint==2.0.23","checkpoint==2.0.24","checkpoint==2.0.25","checkpoint==2.0.26","checkpoint==2.0.3","checkpoint==2.0.4","checkpoint==2.0.5","checkpoint==2.0.6","checkpoint==2.0.7","checkpoint==2.0.8","checkpoint==2.0.9","checkpoint==2.1.0","checkpoint==2.1.1","checkpointduckdb==2.0.0","checkpointduckdb==2.0.1","checkpointduckdb==2.0.2","checkpointpostgres==1.0.0","checkpointpostgres==1.0.1","checkpointpostgres==1.0.10","checkpointpostgres==1.0.11","checkpointpostgres==1.0.2","checkpointpostgres==1.0.3","checkpointpostgres==1.0.4","checkpointpostgres==1.0.5","checkpointpostgres==1.0.6","checkpointpostgres==1.0.7","checkpointpostgres==1.0.8","checkpointpostgres==1.0.9","checkpointpostgres==2.0.0","checkpointpostgres==2.0.1","checkpointpostgres==2.0.10","checkpointpostgres==2.0.11","checkpointpostgres==2.0.12","checkpointpostgres==2.0.13","checkpointpostgres==2.0.14","checkpointpostgres==2.0.15","checkpointpostgres==2.0.16","checkpointpostgres==2.0.17","checkpointpostgres==2.0.18","checkpointpostgres==2.0.19","checkpointpostgres==2.0.2","checkpointpostgres==2.0.20","checkpointpostgres==2.0.21","checkpointpostgres==2.0.22","checkpointpostgres==2.0.23","checkpointpostgres==2.0.3","checkpointpostgres==2.0.4","checkpointpostgres==2.0.5","checkpointpostgres==2.0.6","checkpointpostgres==2.0.7","checkpointpostgres==2.0.8","checkpointpostgres==2.0.9","checkpointsqlite==1.0.0","checkpointsqlite==1.0.1","checkpointsqlite==1.0.2","checkpointsqlite==1.0.3","checkpointsqlite==1.0.4","checkpointsqlite==2.0.0","checkpointsqlite==2.0.1","checkpointsqlite==2.0.10","checkpointsqlite==2.0.2","checkpointsqlite==2.0.3","checkpointsqlite==2.0.4","checkpointsqlite==2.0.5","checkpointsqlite==2.0.6","checkpointsqlite==2.0.7","checkpointsqlite==2.0.8","checkpointsqlite==2.0.9","cli==0.1.40","cli==0.1.41","cli==0.1.42","cli==0.1.44","cli==0.1.45","cli==0.1.45a0","cli==0.1.45a1","cli==0.1.46","cli==0.1.47","cli==0.1.48","cli==0.1.49","cli==0.1.50","cli==0.1.51","cli==0.1.52","cli==0.1.53","cli==0.1.54","cli==0.1.55","cli==0.1.55rc1","cli==0.1.56","cli==0.1.57","cli==0.1.58","cli==0.1.59","cli==0.1.60","cli==0.1.61","cli==0.1.62","cli==0.1.63","cli==0.1.64","cli==0.1.65","cli==0.1.66","cli==0.1.67","cli==0.1.68","cli==0.1.69","cli==0.1.70","cli==0.1.71","cli==0.1.72","cli==0.1.73","cli==0.1.74","cli==0.1.75","cli==0.1.76","cli==0.1.77","cli==0.1.78","cli==0.1.79","cli==0.1.80","cli==0.1.81","cli==0.1.82","cli==0.1.83","cli==0.1.84","cli==0.1.89","cli==0.2.1","cli==0.2.10","cli==0.2.11","cli==0.2.12","cli==0.2.2","cli==0.2.3","cli==0.2.4","cli==0.2.5","cli==0.2.6","cli==0.2.7","cli==0.2.8","cli==0.2.9","cli==0.3.1","cli==0.3.2","cli==0.3.3","cli==0.3.4","cli==0.3.5","cli==0.3.6","langgraph-cli==0.1.39","prebuilt==0.1.0","prebuilt==0.1.1","prebuilt==0.1.2","prebuilt==0.1.3","prebuilt==0.1.4","prebuilt==0.1.5","prebuilt==0.1.6","prebuilt==0.1.7","prebuilt==0.1.8","prebuilt==0.2.0","prebuilt==0.2.1","prebuilt==0.2.2","prebuilt==0.5.0","prebuilt==0.5.0rc0","prebuilt==0.5.1","prebui
