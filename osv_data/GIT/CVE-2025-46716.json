{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-46716","published":"2025-05-22T16:50:18.448Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:16:37.939275Z","aliases":["GHSA-3984-r877-q7xp"],"summary":"Sandboxie Arbitrary Kernel Read in SbieDrv.sys API (API_SET_SECURE_PARAM)","details":"Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. Starting in version 1.3.0 and prior to version 1.15.12, Api_SetSecureParam fails to sanitize incoming pointers, and implicitly trusts that the pointer the user has passed in is safe to read from. SetRegValue then reads an arbitrary address, which can be a kernel pointer, into a HKLM Security SBIE registry value. This can later be retrieved by API_GET_SECURE_PARAM. Version 1.15.12 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/sandboxie","events":[{"introduced":"e823533d3e240a27943323170328f2536aba73e2"},{"fixed":"2c2ab0537b92123886036e87a1f1857e7660ce92"}]}],"versions":["1.3.4","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.10.5","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.11.4","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.12.3","v1.12.4","v1.12.5","v1.12.6","v1.12.7","v1.12.8","v1.12.9","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.13.3","v1.13.4","v1.13.5","v1.13.6","v1.13.7","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.14.10","v1.14.2","v1.14.3","v1.14.4","v1.14.5","v1.14.6","v1.14.7","v1.14.8","v1.14.9","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.15.10","v1.15.11","v1.15.2","v1.15.3","v1.15.4","v1.15.5","v1.15.6","v1.15.7","v1.15.8","v1.15.9","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.5","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.1a","v1.6.1b","v1.6.2","v1.6.2b","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.2a","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v1.9.6","v1.9.7","v1.9.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-46716.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/46xxx/CVE-2025-46716.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/security/advisories/GHSA-3984-r877-q7xp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46716"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-125"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/46xxx/CVE-2025-46716.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
