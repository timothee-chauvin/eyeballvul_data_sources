When\n\"id\" and \"uid\" have the same value, the function simply jumps out of\nthe loop without decrementing the reference count of the object\n\"posix_acls\", which is increased by get_acl() earlier. This may\nresult in memory leaks.\n\nFix it by decreasing the reference count of \"posix_acls\" before\njumping to label \"check_access_bits\".","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"777cad1604d68ed4379ec899d1f7d2f6a29f01f0"},{"fixed":"cf824b95c12a1abacadbc2d069931963221a3414"},{"fixed":"248d71b440aef829f5cc5f6545ca113ef5062900"},{"fixed":"9758a6653c27867d810de02b4e5697163dda9883"},{"fixed":"d21a580dafc69aa04f46e6099616146a536b0724"}]}],"versions":["v5.13","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.5","v5.15.6","v5.15.7","v5.15.8","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.17.1","v5.17.10","v5.17.11","v5.17.12","v5.17.13","v5.17.14","v5.17.2","v5.17.3","v5.17.4","v5.17.5","v5.17.6","v5.17.7","v5.17.8","v5.17.9","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.18.1","v5.18.2","v5.18.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49366.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.15.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.47"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.17.15"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.18.0"},{"fixed":"5.18.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49366.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/248d71b440aef829f5cc5f6545ca113ef5062900"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9758a6653c27867d810de02b4e5697163dda9883"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cf824b95c12a1abacadbc2d069931963221a3414"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d21a580dafc69aa04f46e6099616146a536b0724"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49366.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49366"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49366.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
