This has been observed to result\nin warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while\nTIF_SVE is set:\n\n|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))\n|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */\n\nWarnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g.\n\n  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/\n  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/\n\nThe race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and\nafter manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on\nthe same CPU, e.g.\n\n| void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)\n| {\n|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled\n|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.\n|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.\n|\n|         ...\n|\n|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.\n|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.\n|\n|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();\n|\n|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))\n|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */\n|\n|         sve_init_regs() {\n|                 if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {\n|                         ...\n|                 } else {\n|                         fpsimd_to_sve(current);\n|                         current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE;\n|                 }\n|         }\n|\n|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();\n|\n|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.\n|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0\n|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:\n|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled)\n|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared\n|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore\n| }\n\nFix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set\nby calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU\nstate. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the\nstale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the\nnew state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"cccb78ce89c45a4414db712be4986edfb92434bd"},{"fixed":"51d3d80a6dc314982a9a0aeb0961085922a1aa15"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"cccb78ce89c45a4414db712be4986edfb92434bd"},{"fixed":"de529504b3274d57caf8f66800b714b0d3ee235a"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"cccb78ce89c45a4414db712be4986edfb92434bd"},{"fixed":"51d11ea0250d6ee461987403bbfd4b2abb5613a7"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"cccb78ce89c45a4414db712be4986edfb92434bd"},{"fixed":"fa9ce027b3ce37a2bb173bf2553b5caa438fd8c9"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"cccb78ce89c45a4414db712be4986edfb92434bd"},{"fixed":"751ecf6afd6568adc98f2a6052315552c0483d18"}]}],"versions":["v5.12","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.100","v5.15.101","v5.15.102","v5.15.103","v5.15.104","v5.15.105","v5.15.106","v5.15.107","v5.15.108","v5.15.109","v5.15.11","v5.15.110","v5.15.111","v5.15.112","v5.15.113","v5.15.114","v5.15.115","v5.15.116","v5.15.117","v5.15.118","v5.15.119","v5.15.12","v5.15.120","v5.15.121","v5.15.122","v5.15.123","v5.15.124","v5.15.125","v5.15.126","v5.15.127","v5.15.128","v5.15.129","v5.15.13","v5.15.130","v5.15.131","v5.15.132","v5.15.133","v5.15.134","v5.15.135","v5.15.136","v5.15.137","v5.15.138","v5.15.139","v5.15.14","v5.15.140","v5.15.141","v5.15.142","v5.15.143","v5.15.144","v5.15.145","v5.15.146","v5.15.147","v5.15.148","v5.15.149","v5.15.15","v5.15.150","v5.15.151","v5.15.152","v5.15.153","v5.15.154","v5.15.155","v5.15.156","v5.15.157","v5.15.158","v5.15.159","v5.15.16","v5.15.160","v5.15.161","v5.15.162","v5.15.163","v5.15.164","v5.15.165","v5.15.166","v5.15.167","v5.15.168","v5.15.169","v5.15.17","v5.15.170","v5.15.171","v5.15.172","v5.15.173","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.89","v5.15.9","v5.15.90","v5.15.91","v5.15.92","v5.15.93","v5.15.94","v5.15.95","v5.15.96","v5.15.97","v5.15.98","v5.15.99","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80",
