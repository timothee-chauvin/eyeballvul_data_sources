This exploit exists due to an incomplete fix that was made when this vulnerability was previously disclosed as CVE-2020-35476. Regex validation that was implemented to restrict allowed input to the query API does not work as intended, allowing crafted commands to bypass validation.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opentsdb/opentsdb","events":[{"introduced":"66a6b42fee6ed7382f7ed85d6cbeb65e2725c0a1"},{"last_affected":"eb125a342040376450dd155fe600ff7d4b9c0eec"}]}],"versions":["2.1.1","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.0RC1","v2.0.0RC2","v2.0.0RC3","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.0RC1","v2.1.0RC2","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.2.0","v2.2.0RC1","v2.2.0RC2","v2.2.0RC3","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.3.0","v2.3.0RC1","v2.3.0RC2","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.4.0","v2.4.0RC2","v2.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-25826.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/174570/OpenTSDB-2.4.1-Unauthenticated-Command-Injection.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/opentsdb/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenTSDB/opentsdb/pull/2275"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
