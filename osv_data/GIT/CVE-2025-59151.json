{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-59151","published":"2025-10-27T19:42:59Z","modified":"2025-10-29T05:09:59.928666Z","aliases":["GHSA-5v79-p56f-x7c4"],"summary":"Pi-hole Admin Interface vulnerable to HTTP response header injection via CRLF injection","details":"Pi-hole Admin Interface is a web interface for managing Pi-hole, a network-level advertisement and internet tracker blocking application. Pi-hole Admin Interface before 6.3 is vulnerable to Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) injection. When a request is made to a file ending with the .lp extension, the application performs a redirect without properly sanitizing the input. An attacker can inject carriage return and line feed characters (%0d%0a) to manipulate both the headers and the content of the HTTP response. This enables the injection of arbitrary HTTP response headers, potentially leading to session fixation, cache poisoning, and the weakening or bypassing of browser-based security mechanisms such as Content Security Policy or X-XSS-Protection. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pi-hole/web","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"62c55dcf358663e39c2ab629238ac34609562ae9"}]}],"versions":["0.1","1.0","1.1","1.2","1.2.1","1.3","2.0.0","2.1.0","2.1.1","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.2","v1.3","v1.4","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.3.1","v1.4.3.1a","v1.4.4","v1.4.4.1","v1.4.4.2","v2.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.1","v2.1.0-alpha-1","v2.1.0-beta","v2.1.2","v2.2","v2.2.0","v2.3","v2.3.1","v2.4","v2.5","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v3.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.1a","v3.1","v3.2","v3.2.1","v3.3","v4.0","v4.1","v4.1.1","v4.2","v4.3","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v5.0","v5.1","v5.1.1","v5.10","v5.10.1","v5.11","v5.12","v5.13","v5.14","v5.14.1","v5.14.2","v5.15","v5.15.1","v5.16","v5.17","v5.18","v5.18.1","v5.18.2","v5.18.3","v5.18.4","v5.19","v5.2","v5.2.1","v5.2.2","v5.20","v5.20.1","v5.20.2","v5.21","v5.3","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.4","v5.5","v5.5.1","v5.6","v5.7","v5.8","v5.9","v6.0","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.1","v6.2","v6.2.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59151.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pi-hole/web/security/advisories/GHSA-5v79-p56f-x7c4"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-113","CWE-93"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L"}]}
