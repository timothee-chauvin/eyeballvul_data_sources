{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2020-12887","published":"2020-06-18T19:15:11.783Z","modified":"2025-12-06T06:57:08.366905Z","details":"Memory leaks were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3 when using the Arm mbed-coap library 5.1.5. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses the CoAP option number field of all options present in the input packet. Each option number is calculated as a sum of the previous option number and a delta of the current option. The delta and the previous option number are expressed as unsigned 16-bit integers. Due to lack of overflow detection, it is possible to craft a packet that wraps the option number around and results in the same option number being processed again in a single packet. Certain options allocate memory by calling a memory allocation function. In the cases of COAP_OPTION_URI_QUERY, COAP_OPTION_URI_PATH, COAP_OPTION_LOCATION_QUERY, and COAP_OPTION_ETAG, there is no check on whether memory has already been allocated, which in conjunction with the option number integer overflow may lead to multiple assignments of allocated memory to a single pointer. This has been demonstrated to lead to memory leak by buffer orphaning. As a result, the memory is never freed.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/armmbed/mbed-coap","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-12887.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mjurczak/mbed-coap","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4647a68e364401e81dbd370728127d844f221d93"}]}],"versions":["0.0.0-yotta2","0.0.0-yotta3","0.0.0-yotta4","1.11-RC1","1.3.0","1.3.0-GA","1.3.1","1.3.1.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.4.0","1.4.0-RC1","1.4.0-RC10","1.4.0-RC11","1.4.0-RC2","1.4.0-RC3","1.4.0-RC4","1.4.0-RC5","1.4.0-RC6","1.4.0-RC7","1.4.0-RC8","1.4.0-RC9","1.4.1-RC1","1.4.1-RC2","1.4.1-RC3","1.4.1-RC4","1.4.1-RC5","1.4.1-RC6","1.5-ap","1.5.0","1.5.0-RC1","1.5.0-RC2","1.5.0-RC3","1.5.0-RC4","1.5.0-RC5","1.5.0-RC6","2.0-pre1","2.0-release","2.0.0","2.0.0-RC1","2.0.0-RC2","2.0.0-RC3","2.0.0-RC4","2.0.0-RC5","2.0.1","2.0.1-RC1","2.0.1-RC2","2.0.1.1-RC1","2.1","2.1.0","2.1.0-RC1","2.1.0-RC2","2.1.0-RC3","2.1.0-RC4","2.1.0-RC5","2.1.1","2.1.1-RC1","2.1.1-RC2","2.1.1-RC3","2.1.1-RC4","2.2.0","2.2.0-RC1","2.2.0-RC2","2.2.0-RC4","2.2.0-RC5","2.2.0-RC6","2.2.0-RC7","2.2.0-RC8","2.2.1","2.2.1-RC1","2.2.1-delta-RC1","2.3","R1.2.4-LA","R1.2.5-LA","R1.2.6-LA","R1.2.6-RC1","R1.2.6-RC10","R1.2.6-RC11","R1.2.6-RC2","R1.2.6-RC3","R1.2.6-RC4","R1.2.6-RC5","R1.2.6-RC6","R1.2.6-RC7","R1.2.6-RC8","R1.2.6-RC9","R1.3.0-LA","R1.3.0-RC1","R1.3.0-RC10","R1.3.0-RC11","R1.3.0-RC12","R1.3.0-RC13","R1.3.0-RC14","R1.3.0-RC15","R1.3.0-RC16","R1.3.0-RC17","R1.3.0-RC18","R1.3.0-RC19","R1.3.0-RC2","R1.3.0-RC20","R1.3.0-RC21","R1.3.0-RC22","R1.3.0-RC3","R1.3.0-RC4","R1.3.0-RC5","R1.3.0-RC6","R1.3.0-RC7","R1.3.0-RC8","R1.3.0-RC9","R1.3.1-RC1","R1.3.1-RC2","R1.3.1-RC3","R1.3.1-RC4","R1.3.1-RC5","R1.3.1-hotfix-RC1","R1.3.1-hotfix-RC2","R1.3.2-RC1","R1.3.2-RC2","R1.3.2-RC3","R1.3.2-RC4","R1.3.2-RC5","R1.3.2-RC6","R1.3.2-RC7","R1.3.2-RC8","R1.3.3-RC1","R1.3.3-RC2","R1.3.3-RC3","R1.3.3-RC4","R1.3.3-RC5","RR1.2.0-EA","RR1.2.0-RC1","RR1.2.0-RC10","RR1.2.0-RC11","RR1.2.0-RC2","RR1.2.0-RC3","RR1.2.0-RC4","RR1.2.0-RC5","RR1.2.0-RC6","RR1.2.0-RC7","RR1.2.0-RC8","RR1.2.0-RC9","RR1.2.1-EA","RR1.2.1-RC1","RR1.2.1-RC2","RR1.2.1-RC3","RR1.2.1-RC4","RR1.2.1-RC5","RR1.2.1-RC6","RR1.2.1-RC7","RR1.2.2-EA","RR1.2.2-RC1","RR1.2.2-RC2","RR1.2.2-RC3","RR1.2.2-RC4","RR1.2.2-RC5","RR1.2.2-RC6","RR1.2.3-RC10","RR1.2.3-RC11","RR1.2.3-RC12","RR1.2.3-RC13","RR1.2.3-RC14","RR1.2.3-RC15","RR1.2.3-RC16","RR1.2.3-RC17","RR1.2.3-RC18","RR1.2.3-RC19","RR1.2.3-RC2","RR1.2.3-RC20","RR1.2.3-RC21","RR1.2.3-RC22","RR1.2.3-RC23","RR1.2.3-RC3","RR1.2.3-RC4","RR1.2.3-RC5","RR1.2.3-RC6","RR1.2.3-RC7","RR1.2.3-RC8","RR1.2.3-RC9","RR1.2.4-RC1","RR1.2.4-RC2","RR1.2.4-RC3","RR1.2.4-RC4","RR1.2.5-RC1","RR1.2.5-RC10","RR1.2.5-RC2","RR1.2.5-RC3","RR1.2.5-RC4","RR1.2.5-RC5","RR1.2.5-RC6","RR1.2.5-RC7","RR1.2.5-RC8","RR1.2.5-RC9","beta-release","edge-R0.4.3-RC1","mbed-os-5.0-rc1","mbedos-16.01-release","mbedos-16.03-release","mbedos-2016q1-oob1","mbedos-2016q1-oob2","mbedos-2016q1-oob3","mbedos-release-15-11","mbedos-techcon-oob2","mcc-3.0.0","mcc-3.1.0","mcc-3.1.1","mcc-3.2.0","mcc-3.3.0","mcc-3.4.0","mcc-4.0.0","mcc-4.1.0","mcc-4.2.0","mcc-4.2.1","pdmc-4.3.0","pdmc-4.4.0","v0.0.0-yotta","v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.1.10","v0.1.2","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.1.9","v1.0.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.10","v2.2.11","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.2.5","v2.2.6","v2.2.7","v2.2.8","v2.2.9","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.7.2","v2.7.3","v2.7.4","v2.7.5","v2.7.6","v2.7.7","v2.8.0","v2.9.0","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.10","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.5","v4.0.6","v4.0.7","v4.0.8","v4.0.9","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.2.0","v4.3.0","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.4.2","v4.4.3","v4.4.4","v4.5.0","v4.5.1","v4.6.0","v4.6.1","v4.6.2","v4.6.3","v4.7.0","v4.7.1","v4.7.2","v4.7.3","v4.7.4","v4.8.0","v5.0.0","v5.1.0","v5.1.1","v5.1.2","v5.1.3","v5.1.4","v5.1.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-12887.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["43935030550028460972366703954953134506","61220096632304049730327333197098972093","320150627691496278385405560211966556678","186675183860793561524494747944059615369","127642696780443805742401594398900435540","267445146679481831720080028433391405271","132521230294210119945172885974631191107","324396917462271122704704442064617277709","234437120531583315022205507252856318308","286329828605066593614177102719712564752","87207223341953997356487330374609977771","104328434877095684334150716685446685855","11868571050448402586959641459417779210","303778255609881218744778712752022328171","133750296877345554551232479333421315007","67880556997018554008829165577206203797","92692987032122039680749309224731996056","140265851728056666005343675172730879491","63562575080231242002488574039690694253",
