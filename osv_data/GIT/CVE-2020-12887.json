{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2020-12887","published":"2020-06-18T19:15:11.783Z","modified":"2025-11-28T11:34:55.563173Z","details":"Memory leaks were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3 when using the Arm mbed-coap library 5.1.5. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses the CoAP option number field of all options present in the input packet. Each option number is calculated as a sum of the previous option number and a delta of the current option. The delta and the previous option number are expressed as unsigned 16-bit integers. Due to lack of overflow detection, it is possible to craft a packet that wraps the option number around and results in the same option number being processed again in a single packet. Certain options allocate memory by calling a memory allocation function. In the cases of COAP_OPTION_URI_QUERY, COAP_OPTION_URI_PATH, COAP_OPTION_LOCATION_QUERY, and COAP_OPTION_ETAG, there is no check on whether memory has already been allocated, which in conjunction with the option number integer overflow may lead to multiple assignments of allocated memory to a single pointer. This has been demonstrated to lead to memory leak by buffer orphaning. As a result, the memory is never freed.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mjurczak/mbed-coap","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4647a68e364401e81dbd370728127d844f221d93"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-12887.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/armmbed/mbed-coap","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-12887.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/pull/116"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/12930"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/12957"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mjurczak/mbed-coap/commit/4647a68e364401e81dbd370728127d844f221d93"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
