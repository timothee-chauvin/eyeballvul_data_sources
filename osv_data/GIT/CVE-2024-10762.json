{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-10762","published":"2025-03-20T10:15:19Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:36:50Z","details":"In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"91587496673da24cb7ddedfbbd6e602592b20ef6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-10762.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/23ab508e-d956-4861-b28f-0569d3b404a6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/91587496673da24cb7ddedfbbd6e602592b20ef6"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
