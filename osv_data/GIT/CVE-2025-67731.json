{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-67731","published":"2025-12-12T07:40:53.047Z","modified":"2025-12-14T04:43:20.695392Z","aliases":["GHSA-qgc4-8p88-4w7m"],"summary":"Servify Express does not enforce rate limiting when parsing JSON","details":"Servify Express is a Node.js package to start an Express server and log the port it's running on. Prior to 1.2, the Express server used express.json() without a size limit, which could allow attackers to send extremely large request bodies. This can cause excessive memory usage, degraded performance, or process crashes, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Any application using the JSON parser without limits and exposed to untrusted clients is affected. The issue is not a flaw in Express itself, but in configuration. This issue is fixed in version 1.2. To work around, consider adding a limit option to the JSON parser, rate limiting at the application or reverse-proxy level, rejecting unusually large requests before parsing, or using a reverse proxy (such as NGINX) to enforce maximum request body sizes.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/aarondoran/servify-express","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"197d848e5450bf85b0dd19ef8c2aa4ba96192300"}]}],"versions":["V1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67731.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Aarondoran/servify-express/commit/8dff7f56504b356278d849734ef2050e5cd23b61"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Aarondoran/servify-express/releases/tag/V1.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Aarondoran/servify-express/security/advisories/GHSA-qgc4-8p88-4w7m"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67731.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67731"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-400"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67731.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
