{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-24773","published":"2022-03-18T13:30:14Z","modified":"2025-11-04T19:57:32.331547Z","aliases":["GHSA-2r2c-g63r-vccr"],"summary":"Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in `node-forge`","details":"Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of Transport Layer Security in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code does not properly check `DigestInfo` for a proper ASN.1 structure. This can lead to successful verification with signatures that contain invalid structures but a valid digest. The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There are currently no known workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6c5b90133d46af63d139b98bf65371732c8c7dad"}]}],"versions":["0.1.10","0.1.11","0.1.12","0.1.13","0.1.14","0.1.15","0.1.2","0.1.3","0.1.4","0.1.5","0.1.6","0.1.7","0.1.8","0.1.9","0.10.0","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.10","0.2.11","0.2.12","0.2.13","0.2.14","0.2.15","0.2.17","0.2.18","0.2.19","0.2.2","0.2.20","0.2.21","0.2.22","0.2.23","0.2.24","0.2.25","0.2.26","0.2.27","0.2.28","0.2.29","0.2.3","0.2.30","0.2.31","0.2.32","0.2.33","0.2.34","0.2.35","0.2.36","0.2.37","0.2.4","0.2.5","0.2.6","0.2.7","0.2.8","0.2.9","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.4.3","0.5.1","0.5.2","0.5.3","0.5.4","0.5.5","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.10","0.6.11","0.6.12","0.6.13","0.6.14","0.6.16","0.6.17","0.6.18","0.6.19","0.6.2","0.6.20","0.6.21","0.6.22","0.6.23","0.6.24","0.6.25","0.6.26","0.6.27","0.6.28","0.6.29","0.6.3","0.6.30","0.6.31","0.6.32","0.6.33","0.6.34","0.6.35","0.6.37","0.6.38","0.6.39","0.6.4","0.6.40","0.6.41","0.6.42","0.6.43","0.6.44","0.6.45","0.6.46","0.6.5","0.6.6","0.6.7","0.6.8","0.6.9","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.7.3","0.7.4","0.7.5","0.7.6","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.8.2","0.8.3","0.8.4","0.8.5","0.9.0","0.9.1","0.9.2","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24773.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/3f0b49a0573ef1bb7af7f5673c0cfebf00424df1"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/bb822c02df0b61211836472e29b9790cc541cdb2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-2r2c-g63r-vccr"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-347"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
