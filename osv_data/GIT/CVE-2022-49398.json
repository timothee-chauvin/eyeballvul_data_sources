However, when traversing the list and removing\nitems using gadget giveback, the DWC3 lock is briefly released,\nallowing other routines to execute.  There is a situation where, while\nitems are being removed from the cancelled_list using\ndwc3_gadget_ep_cleanup_cancelled_requests(), the pullup disable\nroutine is running in parallel (due to UDC unbind).  As the cleanup\nroutine removes n, and the pullup disable removes n+1, once the\ncleanup retakes the DWC3 lock, it references a request who was already\nremoved/handled.  With list debug enabled, this leads to a panic.\nEnsure all instances of the macro are replaced where gadget giveback\nis used.\n\nExample call stack:\n\nThread#1:\n__dwc3_gadget_ep_set_halt() - CLEAR
