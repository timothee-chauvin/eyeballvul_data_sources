Such command failure is being\nlogged to command stats. This results in NULL pointer access as command\nstats structure is being freed and reallocated during mlx5 devlink\nreload (see kernel log below).\n\nFix it by making command stats statically allocated on driver probe.\n\nKernel log:\n[ 2394.808802] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 000000000002a9c0\n[ 2394.810610] PGD 0 P4D 0\n[ 2394.811811] Oops: 0002 [#1] SMP NOPTI\n...\n[ 2394.815482] RIP: 0010:native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x183/0x1d0\n...\n[ 2394.829505] Call Trace:\n[ 2394.830667]  _raw_spin_lock_irq+0x23/0x26\n[ 2394.831858]  cmd_status_err+0x55/0x110 [mlx5_core]\n[ 2394.833020]  mlx5_access_reg+0xe7/0x150 [mlx5_core]\n[ 2394.834175]  mlx5_query_port_ptys+0x78/0xa0 [mlx5_core]\n[ 2394.835337]  mlx5e_ethtool_get_link_ksettings+0x74/0x590 [mlx5_core]\n[ 2394.836454]  ? kmem_cache_alloc_trace+0x140/0x1c0\n[ 2394.837562]  __rh_call_get_link_ksettings+0x33/0x100\n[ 2394.838663]  ? __rtnl_unlock+0x25/0x50\n[ 2394.839755]  __ethtool_get_link_ksettings+0x72/0x150\n[ 2394.840862]  duplex_show+0x6e/0xc0\n[ 2394.841963]  dev_attr_show+0x1c/0x40\n[ 2394.843048]  sysfs_kf_seq_show+0x9b/0x100\n[ 2394.844123]  seq_read+0x153/0x410\n[ 2394.845187]  vfs_read+0x91/0x140\n[ 2394.846226]  ksys_read+0x4f/0xb0\n[ 2394.847234]  do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x1a0\n[ 2394.848228]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x65/0xca","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"34f46ae0d4b38e83cfb26fb6f06b5b5efea47fdc"},{"fixed":"ddf458641a511e7dff19f3bf0cbbc5dd9fe08ce5"},{"fixed":"da2e552b469a0cd130ff70a88ccc4139da428a65"}]}],"versions":["v5.17","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-48884.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-48884.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/da2e552b469a0cd130ff70a88ccc4139da428a65"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ddf458641a511e7dff19f3bf0cbbc5dd9fe08ce5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/48xxx/CVE-2022-48884.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48884"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/48xxx/CVE-2022-48884.json"}}
