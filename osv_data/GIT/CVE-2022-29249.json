  "details": "JavaEZ is a library that adds new functions to make Java easier. A weakness in JavaEZ 1.6 allows force decryption of locked text by unauthorized actors. The issue is NOT critical for non-secure applications, however may be critical in a situation where the highest levels of security are required. This issue ONLY affects v1.6 and does not affect anything pre-1.6. The vulnerability has been patched in release 1.7. Currently, there is no way to fix the issue without upgrading.",
