In 2.3.0 and earlier, the password reset flow trusts the Host header, allowing attackers to redirect the administrator’s reset token to an attacker-controlled server. This can be combined with the module installation process to automatically execute the ServiceProvider::boot() method, enabling arbitrary PHP code execution.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/laradashboard/laradashboard","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"029670eeeb685796bc76c7950381cb459b2eb3ba"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2.3.0"}]}}],"versions":["Day1","Day10","Day2","Day3","Day4","Day5","Day6","Day7","Day8","Day9","Laravel11.x","Laravel12.x","Laravel12.x-module-logs","Laravel12.x-tailadmin","Laravel7.x","Laravel9.x","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v11.x-main","v2.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66509.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66509.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/laradashboard/laradashboard/commit/cc42f9cdf8e59bce794ee2d812a9709b1e6efa87"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/laradashboard/laradashboard/security/advisories/GHSA-j9mm-c9cj-pc82"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66509"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-284"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66509.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
