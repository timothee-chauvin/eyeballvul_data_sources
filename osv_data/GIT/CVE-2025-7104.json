{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-7104","published":"2025-09-29T17:15:32.927Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:38:52.267512Z","details":"A mass assignment vulnerability exists in danny-avila/librechat, affecting all versions. This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate sensitive fields by automatically binding user-provided data to internal object properties or database fields without proper filtering. As a result, any extra fields in the request body are included in agentData and passed to the database layer, allowing overwriting of any field in the schema, such as author, access_level, isCollaborative, and projectIds. Additionally, the Object.Prototype can be polluted due to the use of Object.assign with spread operators.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/danny-avila/librechat","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a37bf6719cfbc2de270f7d87b6b85d87cc1768db"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.3","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.4.8","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.5.7","v0.5.8","v0.5.9","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.10","v0.6.5","v0.6.6","v0.6.9","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.3-rc","v0.7.3-rc2","v0.7.4","v0.7.4-rc1","v0.7.5","v0.7.5-rc1","v0.7.5-rc2","v0.7.6","v0.7.6-rc1","v0.7.7","v0.7.7-rc1","v0.7.8","v0.7.8-rc1","v0.7.9-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-7104.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/32a175c4-7543-4503-a3d0-7880abd1826b"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/danny-avila/librechat/commit/a37bf6719cfbc2de270f7d87b6b85d87cc1768db"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
