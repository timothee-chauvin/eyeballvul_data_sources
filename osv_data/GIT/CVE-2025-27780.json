{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-27780","published":"2025-03-19T20:16:31Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:45:39.216459Z","summary":"Applio allows unsafe deserialization in model_information.py","details":"Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to unsafe deserialization in model_information.py. `model_name` in model_information.py takes user-supplied input (e.g. a path to a model) and pass that value to the `run_model_information_script` and later to `model_information` function, which loads that model with `torch.load` in rvc/train/process/model_information.py (on line 16 in 3.2.8-bugfix), which is vulnerable to unsafe deserialization. The issue can lead to remote code execution. A patch is available in the `main` branch of the repository.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/iahispano/applio","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"11d139508d615a6db4d48b76634a443c66170dda"}]}],"versions":["3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","3.0.8","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.2.4","3.2.5","3.2.6","3.2.7","3.2.8-bugfix"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27780.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-341_GHSL-2024-353_Applio/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/commit/11d139508d615a6db4d48b76634a443c66170dda"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/rvc/train/process/model_information.py#L16"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/tabs/extra/model_information.py#L11-L16"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
