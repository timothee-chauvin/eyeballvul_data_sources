crash the kernel in skb_segment() [1]\n\nGSO_BY_FRAGS is a forbidden value, but unfortunately the following\ncomputation in skb_segment() can reach it quite easily :\n\n\tmss = mss * partial_segs;\n\n65535 = 3 * 5 * 17 * 257, so many initial values of mss can lead to\na bad final result.\n\nMake sure to limit segmentation so that the new mss value is smaller\nthan
