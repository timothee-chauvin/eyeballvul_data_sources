Prior to version 0.1.0-a8, an attacker can forge a request that they can pass to redirect an authenticated user to another arbitrary website. In the login page, DiracX-Web has a `redirect` field which is the location where the server will redirect the user. This URI is not verified, and can be an arbitrary URI. Paired with a parameter pollution, an attacker can hide their malicious URI. This could be used for phishing, and extract new data (such as redirecting to a new \"log in\" page, and asking another time credentials). Version 0.1.0-a8 fixes this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/diracgrid/diracx-web","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"04db32be0927f517ba1d188f492b100be2e5b02e"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0-a1","v0.1.0-a2","v0.1.0-a3","v0.1.0-a4","v0.1.0-a5","v0.1.0-a6","v0.1.0-a7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54066.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DIRACGrid/diracx-web/security/advisories/GHSA-hfj7-542q-8fvv"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DIRACGrid/diracx-web/commit/eba3b7bc4f9d394074215986e6d3c15b546b25d5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://diracx-cert.app.cern.ch/auth?redirect=https://ipcim.com/en/where/?dsdsd=qsqsfsjfnsfniizaeiaapzqlalkqkaizqqijsjaopmqmxna?redirect=https://diracx-cert-app.cern.ch/auth"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
