{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62370","published":"2025-10-15T15:32:17Z","modified":"2025-11-14T19:40:36.322811Z","aliases":["GHSA-pgp9-98jm-wwq2","RUSTSEC-2025-0073"],"summary":"Alloy Core has a DoS vulnerability on `alloy_dyn_abi::TypedData` hashing","details":"Alloy Core libraries at the root of the Rust Ethereum ecosystem. Prior to 0.8.26 and 1.4.1, an uncaught panic triggered by malformed input to alloy_dyn_abi::TypedData could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) via eip712_signing_hash(). Software with high availability requirements such as network services may be particularly impacted. If in use, external auto-restarting mechanisms can partially mitigate the availability issues unless repeated attacks are possible. The vulnerability was patched by adding a check to ensure the element is not empty before accessing its first element; an error is returned if it is empty. The fix is included in version v1.4.1 and backported to v0.8.26.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/alloy-rs/core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"79d0ef6e6a4331f5512957bb62a3018ad782b15d"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.8.26"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/alloy-rs/core","events":[{"introduced":"8cc6dd3fc77bb63d8552b4ba2281be7d6f093588"},{"fixed":"f7d4a85a089bdab78f122de18492533589df5254"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.0.0"},{"fixed":"1.4.1"}]}}],"versions":["v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.5","v0.7.6","v0.7.7","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.10","v0.8.11","v0.8.12","v0.8.13","v0.8.14","v0.8.15","v0.8.16","v0.8.17","v0.8.18","v0.8.19","v0.8.2","v0.8.20","v0.8.21","v0.8.22","v0.8.23","v0.8.24","v0.8.25","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.8.5","v0.8.6","v0.8.7","v0.8.8","v0.8.9","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62370.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://crates.io/crates/alloy-dyn-abi/0.8.26"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://crates.io/crates/alloy-dyn-abi/1.4.1"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/alloy-rs/core/commit/7823e9af8c20e9fcfb5360f5eafd891c457ebccf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/alloy-rs/core/security/advisories/GHSA-pgp9-98jm-wwq2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0073.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-248"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
