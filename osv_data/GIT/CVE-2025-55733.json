DeepChat before 0.3.1 has a one-click remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by embedding a specially crafted deepchat: URL on any website, including a malicious one they control. When a victim visits such a site or clicks on the link, the browser triggers the app’s custom URL handler (deepchat:), causing the DeepChat application to launch and process the URL, leading to remote code execution on the victim’s machine. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.3.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/thinkinaixyz/deepchat","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3d183256090066a85c95e72396831cca70b033cf"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.10","v0.0.11","v0.0.12","v0.0.13","v0.0.14","v0.0.15","v0.0.16","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.9","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.0-1","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.3-1","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.8","v0.2.9","v0.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-55733.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/deepchat/commit/a0ff6f362e01ddceb7fd42d0af0b28b6184fb4d2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/deepchat/security/advisories/GHSA-hqr4-4gfc-5p2j"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
