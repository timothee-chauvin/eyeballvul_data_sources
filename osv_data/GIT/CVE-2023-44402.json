This only impacts apps that have the `embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation` and `onlyLoadAppFromAsar` fuses enabled.  Apps without these fuses enabled are not impacted.  This issue is specific to macOS as these fuses are only currently supported on macOS. Specifically this issue can only be exploited if your app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too.  i.e. the ability to edit files inside the `.app` bundle on macOS which these fuses are supposed to protect against. There are no app side workarounds, you must update to a patched version of Electron.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/electron/electron","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"056eacf1ce34c27db00df7bc21aa83a779b8a2d9"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"22.3.24"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/electron/electron","events":[{"introduced":"af0a995bb21d5c9fcbf93f0290ed4714596e978e"},{"last_affected":"4b782e259bebf89016463363d39d8b4411a27529"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"23.0.0-alpha.1"},{"last_affected":"23.3.13"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/electron/electron","events":[{"introduced":"e5e9186d613277c855d913fa21d0f03496c2ff87"},{"fixed":"0508e2554958a430acd18528ff43e56034813d64"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"24.0.0-alpha.1"},{"fixed":"24.8.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/electron/electron","events":[{"introduced":"251e567eff35440e6a0e3812ab20a7bdc21e3065"},{"fixed":"dc3ce65dd5fd872db86e5308ae005a898142435a"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"25.0.0-alpha.1"},{"fixed":"25.8.1"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/electron/electron","events":[{"introduced":"57147d1b8d1352e8f49d6086b9957869d0d1e75a"},{"fixed":"4e9c583230a9454508ea9116432c7929644d2612"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"26.0.0-alpha.1"},{"fixed":"26.2.1"}]}}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.10.3","v0.10.4","v0.10.5","v0.10.6","v0.10.7","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.11.10","v0.11.2","v0.11.3","v0.11.4","v0.11.5","v0.11.6","v0.11.7","v0.11.8","v0.11.9","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.12.3","v0.12.4","v0.12.5","v0.12.6","v0.12.7","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.13.3","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.15.3","v0.15.4","v0.15.5","v0.15.6","v0.15.7","v0.15.8","v0.15.9","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.16.3","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.19.0","v0.19.1","v0.19.2","v0.19.3","v0.19.4","v0.19.5","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.20.3","v0.20.4","v0.20.5","v0.20.6","v0.20.7","v0.20.8","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.21.2","v0.21.3","v0.22.0","v0.22.1","v0.22.2","v0.22.3","v0.23.0","v0.24.0","v0.25.0","v0.25.1","v0.25.2","v0.25.3","v0.26.0","v0.26.1","v0.27.0","v0.27.1","v0.27.2","v0.27.3","v0.28.0","v0.28.1","v0.28.2","v0.28.3","v0.29.0","v0.29.1","v0.29.2","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.30.0","v0.30.1","v0.30.2","v0.30.3","v0.30.4","v0.30.5","v0.31.0","v0.31.1","v0.31.2","v0.32.0","v0.32.1","v0.32.2","v0.32.3","v0.33.0","v0.33.1","v0.33.2","v0.33.3","v0.33.4","v0.33.5","v0.33.6","v0.33.7","v0.33.8","v0.33.9","v0.34.0","v0.34.1","v0.34.2","v0.34.3","v0.35.0","v0.35.1","v0.35.2","v0.35.3","v0.35.4","v0.36.0","v0.36.1","v0.36.10","v0.36.11","v0.36.2","v0.36.3","v0.36.4","v0.36.5","v0.36.6","v0.36.7","v0.36.8","v0.36.9","v0.37.0","v0.37.1","v0.37.2","v0.37.3","v0.37.4","v0.37.5","v0.37.6","v0.37.7","v0.37.8","v0.4.0","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.4.8","v0.4.9","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.10","v0.6.11","v0.6.12","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v0.6.6","v0.6.7","v0.6.8","v0.6.9","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.5","v0.7.6","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.8.5","v0.8.6","v0.8.7","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.10","v1.4.11","v1.4.12","v1.4.13","v1.4.14","v1.4.15","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.4.7","v1.4.8","v1.4.9","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.6.9","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.7.5","v1.7.6","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2-beta.1","v1.8.2-beta.2","v1.8.2-beta.3","v10.0.0-nightly.20200206","v10.0.0-nightly.20200207","v10.0.0-nightly.20200208","v10.0.0-nightly.20200209","v10.0.0-nightly.20200210","v10.0.0-nightly.20200211","v10.0.0-nightly.20200212","v10.0.0-nightly.20200213","v10.0.0-nightly.20200215","v10.0.0-nightly.20200216","v10.0.0-nightly.20200217","v10.0.0-nightly.20200218","v10.0.0-nightly.20200220","v10.0.0-nightly.20200221","v10.0.0-nightly.20200222","v10.0.0-nightly.20200223","v10.0.0-nightly.20200225","v10.0.0-nightly.20200226","v10.0.0-nightly.20200302","v10.0.0-nightly.20200303","v10.0.0-nightly.20200304","v10.0.0-nightly.20200305","v10.0.0-nightly.20200306","v10.0.0-nightly.20200309","v10.0.0-nightly.20200310","v10.0.0-nightly.20200311","v10.0.0-nightly.20200312","v10.0.0-nightly.20200313","v10.0.0-nightly.20200316","v10.0.0-nightly.20200317","v10.0.0-nightly.20200318","v10.0.0-nightly.20200320","v10.0.0-nightly.20200323","v10.0.0-nightly.20200324","v10.0.0-nightly.20200325","v10.0.0-nightly.20200326","v10.0.0-nig
