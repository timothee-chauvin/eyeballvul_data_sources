If PSL support not provided, a more rudimentary check exists to atleast prevent cookies from being set on TLDs. This check was broken if thehost name in the URL uses a trailing dot.This can allow arbitrary sites to set cookies that then would get sent to adifferent and unrelated site or domain.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/curl/curl","events":[{"introduced":"64db5c575d9c5536bd273a890f50777ad1ca7c13"},{"fixed":"462196e6b4a47f924293a0e26b8e9c23d37ac26f"}]}],"versions":["curl-7_82_0","curl-7_83_0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-27779.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1553301"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202212-01"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220609-0009/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
