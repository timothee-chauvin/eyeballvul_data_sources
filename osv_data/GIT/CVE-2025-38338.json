fix double-unlock bug in nfs_return_empty_folio()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/nfs/read: fix double-unlock bug in nfs_return_empty_folio()\n\nSometimes, when a file was read while it was being truncated by\nanother NFS client, the kernel could deadlock because folio_unlock()\nwas called twice, and the second call would XOR back the `PG_locked`\nflag.\n\nMost of the time (depending on the timing of the truncation), nobody\nnotices the problem because folio_unlock() gets called three times,\nwhich flips `PG_locked` back off:\n\n 1. vfs_read, nfs_read_folio, ... nfs_read_add_folio,\n    nfs_return_empty_folio\n 2. vfs_read, nfs_read_folio, ... netfs_read_collection,\n    netfs_unlock_abandoned_read_pages\n 3. vfs_read, ... nfs_do_read_folio, nfs_read_add_folio,\n    nfs_return_empty_folio\n\nThe problem is that nfs_read_add_folio() is not supposed to unlock the\nfolio if fscache is enabled, and a nfs_netfs_folio_unlock() check is\nmissing in nfs_return_empty_folio().\n\nRarely this leads to a warning in netfs_read_collection():\n\n ------------[ cut here

really holding the folio lock.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"000dbe0bec058cbf2ca9e156e4a5584f5158b0f9"},{"fixed":"14f5549ad163be2c018abc1bb38370fff617a243"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"000dbe0bec058cbf2ca9e156e4a5584f5158b0f9"},{"fixed":"5bf0b9eeb0174686f22c2e5b8fb9f47ad25da6f5"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"000dbe0bec058cbf2ca9e156e4a5584f5158b0f9"},{"fixed":"1e93b61d3eaa14bfebcc2716ac09d43f3845d420"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"000dbe0bec058cbf2ca9e156e4a5584f5158b0f9"},{"fixed":"4c10fa44bc5f700e2ea21de2fbae520ba21f19d9"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.15.1","v6.15.2","v6.15.3","v6.3","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.5","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.59","v6.6.6","v6.6.60","v6.6.61","v6.6.62","v6.6.63","v6.6.64","v6.6.65","v6.6.66","v6.6.67","v6.6.68","v6.6.69","v6.6.7","v6.6.70","v6.6.71","v6.6.72","v6.6.73","v6.6.74","v6.6.75","v6.6.76","v6.6.77","v6.6.78","v6.6.79","v6.6.8","v6.6.80","v6.6.81","v6.6.82","v6.6.83","v6.6.84","v6.6.85","v6.6.86","v6.6.87","v6.6.88","v6.6.89","v6.6.9","v6.6.90","v6.6.91","v6.6.92","v6.6.93","v6.6.94","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38338.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.4.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.95"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.35"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.15.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38338.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/14f5549ad163be2c018abc1bb38370fff617a243"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1e93b61d3eaa14bfebcc2716ac09d43f3845d420"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4c10fa44bc5f700e2ea21de2fbae520ba21f19d9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5bf0b9eeb0174686f22c2e5b8fb9f47ad25da6f5"}]}
