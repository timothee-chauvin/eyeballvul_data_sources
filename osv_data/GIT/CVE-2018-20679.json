An out of bounds read in udhcp components (consumed by the DHCP server, client, and relay) allows a remote attacker to leak sensitive information from the stack by sending a crafted DHCP message. This is related to verification in udhcp_get_option() in networking/udhcp/common.c that 4-byte options are indeed 4 bytes.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mirror/busybox","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ef800e5441185585986f9b7aaf39010a926fbd5f"}]}],"versions":["0_29alpha2","0_32","0_33","0_34","0_36","0_39","0_40","0_41","0_42","0_43","0_43pre1","0_45","0_46","0_47","0_48","0_49","0_50","0_51","0_52","0_60_0","0_60_1","0_60_2","0_60_3","0_60_4","0_60_5","1_00","1_00_pre1","1_00_pre10","1_00_pre2","1_00_pre3","1_00_pre4","1_00_pre5","1_00_pre6","1_00_pre7","1_00_pre8","1_00_pre9","1_00_rc1","1_00_rc2","1_00_rc3","1_10_0","1_12_0","1_14_0","1_15_0","1_16_0","1_17_0","1_18_0","1_19_0","1_1_0","1_1_1","1_20_0","1_21_0","1_22_0","1_23_0","1_24_0","1_25_0","1_26_0","1_27_0","1_28_0","1_29_0","1_2_0","1_4_0","1_8_0","1_9_0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-20679.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154361/Cisco-Device-Hardcoded-Credentials-GNU-glibc-BusyBox.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Sep/7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Sep/7"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://bugs.busybox.net/show_bug.cgi?id=11506"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://busybox.net/news.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit/?id=6d3b4bb24da9a07c263f3c1acf8df85382ff562c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3935-1/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
