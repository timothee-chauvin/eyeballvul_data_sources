{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-59433","published":"2025-09-22T19:14:54.237Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:20:53.181194Z","aliases":["GHSA-vh25-5764-9wcr"],"summary":"@conventional-changelog/git-client has an Argument Injection vulnerability","details":"Conventional Changelog generates changelogs and release notes from a project's commit messages and metadata. Prior to version 2.0.0, @conventional-changelog/git-client has an argument injection vulnerability. This vulnerability manifests with the library's getTags() API, which allows extra parameters to be passed to the git log command. In another API by this library, getRawCommits(), there are secure practices taken to ensure that the extra parameter path is unable to inject an argument by ending the git log command with the special shell syntax --. However, the library does not follow the same practice for getTags() as it does not attempt to sanitize for user input, validate the given params, or restrict them to an allow list. Nor does it properly pass command-line flags to the git binary using the double-dash POSIX characters (--) to communicate the end of options. Thus, allowing users to exploit an argument injection vulnerability in Git due to the --output= command-line option that results with overwriting arbitrary files. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ce1fd981f88ce201e996dfa833e4682de3aafcdd"}]}],"versions":["conventional-changelog-angular@1.3.1","conventional-changelog-angular@1.3.2","conventional-changelog-angular@1.3.3","conventional-changelog-angular@1.4.0","conventional-changelog-angular@1.5.0","conventional-changelog-angular@1.5.1","conventional-changelog-angular@1.5.2","conventional-changelog-angular@1.5.3","conventional-changelog-angular@1.6.0","conventional-changelog-angular@1.6.1","conventional-changelog-angular@1.6.2","conventional-changelog-angular@1.6.3","conventional-changelog-angular@1.6.4","conventional-changelog-angular@1.6.5","conventional-changelog-angular@1.6.6","conventional-changelog-angular@3.0.0","conventional-changelog-angular@3.0.1","conventional-changelog-angular@3.0.2","conventional-changelog-angular@3.0.3","conventional-changelog-angular@3.0.4","conventional-changelog-angular@3.0.5","conventional-changelog-angular@3.0.6","conventional-changelog-angular@3.0.7","conventional-changelog-atom@0.1.1","conventional-changelog-atom@0.1.2","conventional-changelog-atom@0.2.0","conventional-changelog-atom@0.2.1","conventional-changelog-atom@0.2.2","conventional-changelog-atom@0.2.3","conventional-changelog-atom@0.2.4","conventional-changelog-atom@0.2.5","conventional-changelog-atom@0.2.6","conventional-changelog-atom@0.2.7","conventional-changelog-atom@0.2.8","conventional-changelog-cli@1.2.0","conventional-changelog-cli@1.2.1","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.0","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.1","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.10","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.11","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.12","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.13","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.14","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.15","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.16","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.17","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.18","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.19","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.2","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.20","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.21","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.22","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.3","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.4","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.5","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.6","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.7","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.8","conventional-changelog-cli@1.3.9","conventional-changelog-codemirror@0.2.0","conventional-changelog-codemirror@0.2.1","conventional-changelog-codemirror@0.3.0","conventional-changelog-codemirror@0.3.1","conventional-changelog-codemirror@0.3.2","conventional-changelog-codemirror@0.3.3","conventional-changelog-codemirror@0.3.4","conventional-changelog-codemirror@0.3.5","conventional-changelog-codemirror@0.3.6","conventional-changelog-codemirror@0.3.7","conventional-changelog-codemirror@0.3.8","conventional-changelog-core@1.5.0","conventional-changelog-core@1.6.0","conventional-changelog-core@1.7.0","conventional-changelog-core@1.8.0","conventional-changelog-core@1.9.0","conventional-changelog-core@1.9.1","conventional-changelog-core@1.9.2","conventional-changelog-core@1.9.3","conventional-changelog-core@1.9.4","conventional-changelog-core@1.9.5","conventional-changelog-core@2.0.0","conventional-changelog-core@2.0.1","conventional-changelog-core@2.0.10","conventional-changelog-core@2.0.11","conventional-changelog-core@2.0.2","conventional-changelog-core@2.0.3","conventional-changelog-core@2.0.4","conventional-changelog-core@2.0.5","conventional-changelog-core@2.0.6","conventional-changelog-core@2.0.7","conventional-changelog-core@2.0.8","conventional-changelog-core@2.0.9","conventional-changelog-ember@0.2.10","conventional-changelog-ember@0.2.3","conventional-changelog-ember@0.2.4","conventional-changelog-ember@0.2.5","conventional-changelog-ember@0.2.6","conventional-changelog-ember@0.2.7","conventional-changelog-ember@0.2.8","conventional-changelog-ember@0.2.9","conventional-changelog-ember@0.3.0","conventional-changelog-ember@0.3.1","conventional-changelog-ember@0.3.10","conventional-changelog-ember@0.3.11","conventional-changelog-ember@0.3.12","conventional-changelog-ember@0.3.2","conventional-changelog-ember@0.3.3","conventional-changelog-ember@0.3.4","conventional-changelog-ember@0.3.5","conventional-changelog-ember@0.3.6","conventional-changelog-ember@0.3.7","conventional-changelog-ember@0.3.8","conventional-changelog-ember@0.3.9","conventional-changelog-eslint@0.2.0","conventional-changelog-eslint@0.2.1","conventional-changelog-eslint@0.3.0","conventional-changelog-eslint@1.0.0","conventional-changelog-eslint@1.0.1","conventional-changelog-eslint@1.0.2","conventional-changelog-eslint@1.0.3","conventional-changelog-eslint@1.0.4","conventional-changelog-eslint@1.0.5","conventional-changelog-eslint@1.0.6","conventional-changelog-eslint@1.0.7","conventional-changelog-eslint@1.0.8","conventional-changelog-eslint@1.0.9","conventional-changelog-express@0.2.0","conventional-changelog-express@0
