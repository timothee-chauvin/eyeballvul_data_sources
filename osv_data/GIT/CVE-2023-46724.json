Due to an Improper Validation of Specified Index bug, Squid versions 3.3.0.1 through 5.9 and 6.0 prior to 6.4 compiled using `--with-openssl` are vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against SSL Certificate validation. This problem allows a remote server to perform Denial of Service against Squid Proxy by initiating a TLS Handshake with a specially crafted SSL Certificate in a server certificate chain. This attack is limited to HTTPS and SSL-Bump. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.4. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. Those who you use a prepackaged version of Squid should refer to the package vendor for availability information on updated packages.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/squid-cache/squid","events":[{"introduced":"b6bc3157c337458cd6615fd2120fa5446f82d1c3"},{"fixed":"1d8175b27fc1c347649d4f221ff2633e8d800429"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-46724.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-73m6-jm96-c6r3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231208-0001/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/b70f864940225dfe69f9f653f948e787f99c3810"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/SQUID-2023_4.patch"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v6/SQUID-2023_4.patch"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5QASTMCUSUEW3UOMKHZJB3FTONWSRXS/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MEV66D3PAAY6K7TWDT3WZBLCPLASFJDC/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-125","CWE-1285","CWE-129","CWE-786","CWE-823"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
