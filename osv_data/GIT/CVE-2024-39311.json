Prior to version 10.0.1 of Publify, corresponding to versions prior to 10.0.2 of the `publify_core` rubygem, publisher on a `publify` application is able to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an administrator using the redirect functionality. The exploitation of this XSS vulnerability requires the administrator to click a malicious link. An attack could attempt to hide their payload by using HTML, or other encodings, as to not make it obvious to an administrator that this is a malicious link. A publisher may attempt to use this vulnerability to escalate their privileges and become an administrator. Version 10.0.1 of Publify and version 10.0.2 of the `publify_core` rubygem fix the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/publify/publify","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c9c2ab199224500824b2483121de2983468caca7"}]}],"versions":["5_3_0","6.9.0","7.0.0","7.1.0","release-1.6.7","release-5.0.3","release-5.0.3-no-rly","release-5.0.3.98","release-5.1","release-5.1.1","release-5.1.2","release-5.1.3","release_5_1_98","release_5_2_0","release_5_2_98","release_5_4_0","release_5_4_1","release_5_4_2","release_5_4_3","release_5_4_4","release_5_5","release_6_0_0","release_6_0_1","release_6_0_2","release_6_0_3","release_6_0_4","release_6_0_6","release_6_0_7","release_6_0_8","release_6_0_9","release_6_1_0","release_6_1_1","release_6_1_2","release_6_1_3","release_6_1_4","release_7_0_0-beta1","v10.0.0","v8.0","v8.0.1","v8.0.2","v8.1.0","v8.1.1","v8.2.0","v8.3.0","v8.3.1","v8.3.2","v8.3.3","v9.0.0","v9.0.1","v9.1.0","v9.2.0","v9.2.1","v9.2.10","v9.2.2","v9.2.3","v9.2.4","v9.2.5","v9.2.6","v9.2.7","v9.2.8","v9.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-39311.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/publify/publify/security/advisories/GHSA-8fm5-gg2f-f66q"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N/E:P"}]}
