{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-34096","published":"2023-06-08T18:59:51Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:13:25.187255Z","aliases":["GHSA-vhqc-649h-994h"],"summary":"Thruk has Path Traversal Vulnerability in panorama.pm","details":"Thruk is a multibackend monitoring webinterface which currently supports Naemon, Icinga, Shinken and Nagios as backends. In versions 3.06 and prior, the file `panorama.pm` is vulnerable to a Path Traversal vulnerability which allows an attacker to upload a file to any folder which has write permissions on the affected system. The parameter location is not filtered, validated or sanitized and it accepts any kind of characters. For a path traversal attack, the only characters required were the dot (`.`) and the slash (`/`). A fix is available in version 3.06.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sni/thruk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4462bbc0f236619abe5fec404b023299b7908434"}]}],"versions":["0.20","1.0.0","1.0.1","v0.20","v0.21_1","v0.27_1","v0.27_2","v0.30","v0.32","v0.46","v0.48","v0.50","v0.52","v0.54","v0.56","v0.58","v0.60","v0.66","v0.70","v0.70.1","v0.72","v0.72.2","v0.74","v0.76","v0.76.1","v0.78","v0.78.1","v0.78.2","v0.80","v0.82","v0.82.1","v0.84","v0.86","v0.90","v0.92","v0.94","v0.94.1","v0.94.2","v0.94.3","v0.94.4","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.18","v1.20","v1.22","v1.24","v1.26","v1.28","v1.30","v1.32","v1.34","v1.36","v1.38","v1.40","v1.42","v1.44","v1.46","v1.48","v1.50","v1.52","v1.54","v1.56","v1.58","v1.60","v1.60-2","v1.62","v1.64","v1.64-2","v1.66","v1.66-2","v1.68","v1.70","v1.70-2","v1.70-3","v1.70-4","v1.72","v1.72-2","v1.74","v1.74-2","v1.76","v1.76-2","v1.76-3","v1.78","v1.78-2","v1.78-3","v1.80","v1.80-2","v1.80-3","v1.82","v1.82-2","v1.84","v1.84-2","v1.84-3","v1.84-4","v1.84-5","v1.84-6","v1.86","v1.86-2","v1.86-3","v1.86-4","v1.88","v1.88-2","v1.88-3","v1.88-4","v2.00","v2.00-2","v2.02","v2.04","v2.06","v2.08","v2.10","v2.10-2","v2.12","v2.12-2","v2.12-3","v2.14","v2.14-2","v2.16","v2.16-2","v2.18","v2.20","v2.20-2","v2.22","v2.24","v2.24-2","v2.26","v2.26-2","v2.28","v2.30","v2.30-2","v2.32","v2.32-2","v2.34","v2.34-2","v2.34-3","v2.36","v2.38","v2.38-2","v2.40","v2.40-2","v2.42","v2.42-2","v2.44","v2.44-2","v2.44-3","v2.44.3","v2.46","v2.46.2","v2.46.3","v2.48","v2.48.2","v3.00","v3.00-alpha","v3.02","v3.04","v3.06"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-34096.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172822/Thruk-Monitoring-Web-Interface-3.06-Path-Traversal.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://galogetlatorre.blogspot.com/2023/06/cve-2023-34096-path-traversal-thruk.html"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/galoget/Thruk-CVE-2023-34096"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L690"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L705"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L727"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/1bc5a5804bf9fc22e82a4eadb21a1795954f0867/plugins/plugins-available/panorama/lib/Thruk/Controller/panorama.pm#L735"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sni/Thruk/commit/26de047275c355c5ae2bbbc51b164f0f8bef5c5b"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sni/Thruk/commit/cf03f67621b7bb20e2c768bc62b30e976206aa17"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sni/Thruk/security/advisories/GHSA-vhqc-649h-994h"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51509"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
