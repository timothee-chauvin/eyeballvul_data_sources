Prior to version 2.4.4, an out-of-bounds array access issue exists in WAMR's fast interpreter mode during WASM bytecode loading. When frame_ref_bottom and frame_offset_bottom arrays are at capacity and a GET_GLOBAL(I32) opcode is encountered, frame_ref_bottom is expanded but frame_offset_bottom may not be. If this is immediately followed by an if opcode that triggers preserve_local_for_block, the function traverses arrays using stack_cell_num as the upper bound, causing out-of-bounds access to frame_offset_bottom since it wasn't expanded to match the increased stack_cell_num. This issue has been patched in version 2.4.4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8c18e3f68b16c4bcaf05996b2636f6ed2b4cf629"}]}],"versions":["01-12-2020","WAMR-01-18-2022","WAMR-01-29-2021","WAMR-02-18-2020","WAMR-02-27-2020","WAMR-03-05-2020","WAMR-03-19-2020","WAMR-03-25-2021","WAMR-03-30-2020","WAMR-04-15-2020","WAMR-04-15-2021","WAMR-05-18-2022","WAMR-06-15-2020","WAMR-07-10-2020","WAMR-08-10-2021","WAMR-09-08-2020","WAMR-09-29-2020","WAMR-1.0.0","WAMR-1.1.0","WAMR-1.1.1","WAMR-1.1.2","WAMR-1.2.0","WAMR-1.2.1","WAMR-1.2.2","WAMR-1.2.3","WAMR-1.3.0","WAMR-1.3.1","WAMR-1.3.2","WAMR-12-30-2021","WAMR-2.0.0","WAMR-2.1.0","WAMR-2.1.1","WAMR-2.1.2","WAMR-2.2.0","WAMR-2.3.0","WAMR-2.3.1","WAMR-2.4.0","WAMR-2.4.1","WAMR-2.4.2","WAMR-2.4.3","tag-11-28-2019"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64713.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/releases/tag/WAMR-2.4.4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/security/advisories/GHSA-gvx3-gg3x-rjcx"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-119"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
