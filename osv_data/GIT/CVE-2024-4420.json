This will crash as Tink just assumes any valid JSON input will contain an object.\n\n\n  *  An adversary can crash binaries using the crypto::tink::JsonKeysetReader in tink-cc by providing an input containing many nested JSON objects. This may result in a stack overflow.\n\n\nWe recommend upgrading to version 2.1.3 or above","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tink-crypto/tink-cc","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"784e7e542cb8bdf85fbd5a1f2a3c2a911345452f"}]}],"versions":["v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-4420.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tink-crypto/tink-cc/issues/4"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
