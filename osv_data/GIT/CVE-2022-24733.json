{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-24733","published":"2022-03-14T18:50:10Z","modified":"2025-12-04T10:17:53.996206Z","aliases":["GHSA-4jp3-q2qm-9fmw"],"summary":"Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames in Sylius","details":"Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2, it is possible for a page controlled by an attacker to load the website within an iframe. This will enable a clickjacking attack, in which the attacker's page overlays the target application's interface with a different interface provided by the attacker. The issue is fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2. A workaround is available. Every response from app should have an X-Frame-Options header set to: ``sameorigin``. To achieve that, add a new `subscriber` in the app.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sylius/sylius","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d7b8773600e69ccbcd6d498a77b98241c0049978"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.9.10"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sylius/sylius","events":[{"introduced":"a367bc010cbee9fdf491dc76397198231f14ab63"},{"fixed":"a23522172c3721ce778e6a48684396653d9a8358"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.10.0"},{"fixed":"1.10.11"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sylius/sylius","events":[{"introduced":"d8a10279adea6a11039f2aeef37bc2cbc686c971"},{"fixed":"c1f4588f8817e42a9bbdc1d1c14b188bd53d79e8"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.11.0"},{"fixed":"1.11.2"}]}}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24733.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/24xxx/CVE-2022-24733.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/releases/tag/v1.10.11"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/releases/tag/v1.11.2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/releases/tag/v1.9.10"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/security/advisories/GHSA-4jp3-q2qm-9fmw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24733"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-1021"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/24xxx/CVE-2022-24733.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
