This includes any entity with permission to directly call SignalWorkflowExecution or SignalWithStartWorkflowExecution, or any entity can deploy a worker that has access to call workflow progress APIs (specifically RespondWorkflowTaskCompleted).\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/temporalio/ui-server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"fe4d88a3477e7c01bad0ab761853e87e3e472b01"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.10.3","v0.10.4","v0.10.5","v0.10.6","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.10.2","v2.10.3","v2.11.0","v2.11.1","v2.11.2","v2.12.0","v2.13.0","v2.13.1","v2.13.2","v2.13.3","v2.14.0","v2.15.0","v2.16.0","v2.16.1","v2.16.2","v2.17.0","v2.17.1","v2.17.2","v2.18.0","v2.18.1","v2.18.2","v2.19.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.20.0","v2.21.0","v2.21.1","v2.21.2","v2.21.3","v2.21.4","v2.22.0","v2.22.1","v2.22.2","v2.22.3","v2.23.0","v2.24.0","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.8.3","v2.9.0","v2.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-2435.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/ui-server/releases/tag/v2.25.0"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
