When multiple threads or VFs try to access the same\nregisters simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions. By using the\nRLCG interface, the driver can serialize access to the registers. This\nmeans that only one thread can access the registers at a time,\npreventing conflicts and ensuring that operations are performed\ncorrectly. Additionally, when a low-priority task holds a mutex that a\nhigh-priority task needs, ie., If a thread holding a spinlock tries to\nacquire a mutex, it can lead to priority inversion. register access in\namdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw especially in a fast code path is critical.\n\nThe call stack shows that the function amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw is being\ncalled, which attempts to acquire the mutex. This function is invoked\nfrom amdgpu_sriov_wreg, which in turn is called from\ngmc_v11_0_flush_gpu_tlb.\n\nThe [ BUG: Invalid wait context ] indicates that a thread is trying to\nacquire a mutex while it is in a context that does not allow it to sleep\n(like holding a spinlock).\n\nFixes the below:\n\n[  253.013423] =============================\n[  253.013434] [ BUG: Invalid wait context
