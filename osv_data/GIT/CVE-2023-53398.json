Such case was\npossible during re-sync action. WARN_ON_ONCE covers future cases.\n\nThere were out-of-order cqe spotted which lead to drain of the queue and\nuse-after-free because of lack of fifo pointers check. Special check and\ncounter are added to avoid resync operation if SKB could not exist in the\nfifo because of OOO cqe (skb_id must be between consumer and producer\nindex).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"58a518948f60153e8f6cb8361d2712aa3a1af94a"},{"fixed":"52e6e7a0bc04c85012a9251c7cf2d444a77eb966"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"58a518948f60153e8f6cb8361d2712aa3a1af94a"},{"fixed":"6afdedc4e66e3846ce497744f01b95c34bf39d21"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"58a518948f60153e8f6cb8361d2712aa3a1af94a"},{"fixed":"3a50cf1e8e5157b82268eee7e330dbe5736a0948"}]}],"versions":["v5.19","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.2.1","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53398.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.18"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53398.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3a50cf1e8e5157b82268eee7e330dbe5736a0948"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/52e6e7a0bc04c85012a9251c7cf2d444a77eb966"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6afdedc4e66e3846ce497744f01b95c34bf39d21"}]}
