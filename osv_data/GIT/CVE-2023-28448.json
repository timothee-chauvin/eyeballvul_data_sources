  "details": "Versionize is a framework for version tolerant serializion/deserialization of Rust data structures, designed for usecases that need fast deserialization times and minimal size overhead. An issue was discovered in the \u2018Versionize::deserialize\u2019 implementation provided by the \u2018versionize\u2019 crate for \u2018vmm_sys_utils::fam::FamStructWrapper', which can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The impact started with version 0.1.1. The issue was corrected in version 0.1.10 by inserting a check that verifies, for any deserialized header, the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal and aborting deserialization otherwise.\n",
