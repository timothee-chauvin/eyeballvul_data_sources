An issue was discovered in the ‘Versionize::deserialize’ implementation provided by the ‘versionize’ crate for ‘vmm_sys_utils::fam::FamStructWrapper', which can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The impact started with version 0.1.1. The issue was corrected in version 0.1.10 by inserting a check that verifies, for any deserialized header, the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal and aborting deserialization otherwise.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/versionize","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3385d797c5e5f547562d8d83fb49de69f917e1f2"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.1.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-28448.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/versionize/commit/a57a051ba006cfa3b41a0532f484df759e008d47"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/versionize/pull/53"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/versionize/security/advisories/GHSA-8vxc-r5wp-vgvc"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-125"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L"}]}
