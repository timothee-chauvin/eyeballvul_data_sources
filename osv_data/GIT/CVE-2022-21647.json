Deserialization of Untrusted Data was found in the `old()` function in CodeIgniter4. Remote attackers may inject auto-loadable arbitrary objects with this vulnerability, and possibly execute existing PHP code on the server. We are aware of a working exploit, which can lead to SQL injection. Users are advised to upgrade to v4.1.6 or later. Users unable to upgrade as advised to not use the `old()` function and form_helper nor `RedirectResponse::withInput()` and `redirect()->withInput()`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/codeigniter4/codeigniter4","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6b2816c7fe7bef75da6be286a16800c4f5d9992d"}]}],"versions":["4.0.0","4.0.2","v4.0.0-alpha.1","v4.0.0-alpha.2","v4.0.0-alpha.3","v4.0.0-alpha.4","v4.0.0-alpha.5","v4.0.0-beta.1","v4.0.0-beta.3","v4.0.0-beta.4","v4.0.0-rc.1","v4.0.0-rc.2","v4.0.0-rc.2.1","v4.0.0-rc.2b","v4.0.0-rc.3","v4.0.0-rc.4","v4.0.0.0-alpha.5","v4.0.1","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.5","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.1.3","v4.1.4","v4.1.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-21647.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/21xxx/CVE-2022-21647.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/commit/ce95ed5765256e2f09f3513e7d42790e0d6948f5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/security/advisories/GHSA-w6jr-wj64-mc9x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21647"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/21xxx/CVE-2022-21647.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H"}]}
