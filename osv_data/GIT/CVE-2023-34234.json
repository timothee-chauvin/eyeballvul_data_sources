{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-34234","published":"2023-06-07T17:06:10.154Z","modified":"2025-11-20T21:15:10.496660Z","aliases":["GHSA-5h3x-9wvq-w4m2"],"summary":"Governor proposal creation may be blocked by frontrunning in OpenZeppelin","details":" OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. By frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the proposer and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this repeatedly to try to prevent a proposal from being proposed at all. This impacts the `Governor` contract in v4.9.0 only, and the `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` contract since v4.3.0. This problem has been patched in 4.9.1 by introducing opt-in frontrunning protection. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may submit the proposal creation transaction to an endpoint with frontrunning protection as a workaround.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d9474327a492f9f310f31bc53f38dbea56ed9a57"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.11.0-rc.1","v1.12.0","v1.12.0-rc.1","v1.12.0-rc.2","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-rc.1","v2.0.0-rc.2","v2.0.0-rc.3","v2.0.0-rc.4","v2.0.1","v2.1.0-rc.1","v2.1.0-rc.2","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.2.0","v2.2.0-rc.1","v2.3.0","v2.3.0-rc.0","v2.3.0-rc.1","v2.3.0-rc.2","v2.3.0-rc.3","v2.4.0","v2.4.0-beta.0","v2.4.0-beta.1","v2.4.0-beta.2","v2.5.0","v2.5.0-rc.0","v2.5.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-rc.0","v3.0.0-rc.1","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.1.0","v3.1.0-rc.0","v3.1.0-solc-0.7","v3.2.0","v3.2.0-rc.0","v3.2.1-solc-0.7","v3.2.2-solc-0.7","v3.3.0","v3.3.0-rc.0","v3.3.0-rc.1","v3.3.0-rc.2","v3.4.0","v3.4.0-rc.0","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-beta.0","v4.0.0-beta.1","v4.0.0-rc.0","v4.1.0","v4.1.0-rc.0","v4.2.0","v4.2.0-rc.0","v4.3.0","v4.3.0-rc.0","v4.3.1","v4.3.2","v4.4.0","v4.4.0-rc.0","v4.4.0-rc.1","v4.4.1","v4.8.0","v4.8.0-rc.0","v4.8.0-rc.1","v4.8.0-rc.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-34234.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable","events":[{"introduced":"618d129b52c14aea8d37a413e4c8b643439abe73"},{"fixed":"43b82754979c35abcd3ccad7b795754146c62ade"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-34234.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/d9474327a492f9f310f31bc53f38dbea56ed9a57"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-5h3x-9wvq-w4m2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-862"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
