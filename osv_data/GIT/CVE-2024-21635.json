{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-21635","published":"2025-11-14T14:11:38Z","modified":"2025-11-14T19:42:39.664538Z","aliases":["GHSA-mr34-8733-grr2"],"summary":"Memos Access Tokens Stay Valid after User Password Change","details":"Memos is a privacy-first, lightweight note-taking service that uses Access Tokens to authenticate application access. When a user changes their password, the existing list of Access Tokens stay valid instead of expiring. If a user finds that their account has been compromised, they can update their password. In versions up to and including 0.18.1, though, the bad actor will still have access to their account because the bad actor's Access Token stays on the list as a valid token. The user will have to manually delete the bad actor's Access Token to secure their account. The list of Access Tokens has a generic Description which makes it hard to pinpoint a bad actor in a list of Access Tokens. A known patched version of Memos isn't available. To improve Memos security, all Access Tokens will need to be revoked when a user changes their password. This removes the session for all the user's devices and prompts the user to log in again. One can treat the old Access Tokens as \"invalid\" because those Access Tokens were created with the older password.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/usememos/memos","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"749187e1e9970377796a3eaf7c4ff89479dbeabb"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.18.1"}]}}],"versions":["v0.1.2","v0.10.2","v0.10.3","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.11.2","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.14.4","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.17.1","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-21635.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/usememos/memos/security/advisories/GHSA-mr34-8733-grr2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
