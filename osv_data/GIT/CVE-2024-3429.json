{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-3429","published":"2024-06-06T19:16:02Z","modified":"2025-07-02T00:30:20.186694Z","withdrawn":"2025-07-24T18:59:43.002239Z","aliases":["GHSA-3x47-w4rx-6pm7"],"details":"A path traversal vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms application, specifically within the `sanitize_path_from_endpoint` and `sanitize_path` functions in `lollms_core\\lollms\\security.py`. This vulnerability allows for arbitrary file reading when the application is running on Windows. The issue arises due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, enabling attackers to bypass the path traversal protection mechanisms by crafting malicious input. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, information disclosure, and potentially a denial of service (DoS) condition by including numerous large or resource-intensive files. This vulnerability affects the latest version prior to 9.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/parisneo/lollms","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f4424cfc3d6dfb3ad5ac17dd46801efe784933e9"}]}],"versions":["v5.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-3429.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/fd8f50c8-17f0-40be-a2c6-bb8d80f7c409"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/parisneo/lollms/commit/f4424cfc3d6dfb3ad5ac17dd46801efe784933e9"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
