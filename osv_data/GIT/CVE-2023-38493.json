When Spring integration is used, Armeria calls Spring controllers via `TomcatService` or `JettyService` with the path that may contain matrix variables. Prior to version 1.24.3, the Armeria decorators might not invoked because of the matrix variables. If an attacker sends a specially crafted request, the request may bypass the authorizer. Version 1.24.3 contains a patch for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/line/armeria","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"195e1670218caf1ec00fa0ab631486d6224b72c2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-38493.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/line/armeria/security/advisories/GHSA-wvp2-9ppw-337j"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/line/armeria/commit/039db50bbfc88014ea8737fd1e1ddd6fd3fc4f07"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc/mvc-controller/ann-methods/matrix-variables.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-863"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
