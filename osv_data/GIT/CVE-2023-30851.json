This issue only impacts users who have a HTTP policy that applies to multiple `toEndpoints` AND have an allow-all rule in place that affects only one of those endpoints. In such cases, a wildcard rule will be appended to the set of HTTP rules, which could cause bypass of HTTP policies. This issue has been patched in Cilium 1.11.16, 1.12.9, and 1.13.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9ce6d643e44b3a7894827d339859f0581aad4531"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.11.16"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium","events":[{"introduced":"9447cd1bfab4424ccb59b5ea9ca41f89590261d4"},{"fixed":"e0bb30aa24aa7a6966c1a0aa52e10cdb34a02cd7"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.12.0"},{"fixed":"1.12.9"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium","events":[{"introduced":"c9723a8df3cfa336da1f8457a864105d8349acfe"},{"fixed":"8cb94c70f7105f29a69e754d2b8969117e681775"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.13.0"},{"fixed":"1.13.2"}]}}],"versions":["1.10.0-rc0","1.11.0","1.11.0-rc0","1.11.0-rc1","1.11.0-rc2","1.11.0-rc3","1.11.1","1.11.10","1.11.11","1.11.12","1.11.13","1.11.14","1.11.15","1.11.2","1.11.3","1.11.4","1.11.5","1.11.6","1.11.7","1.11.8","1.11.9","1.12.0","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.12.3","1.12.4","1.12.5","1.12.6","1.12.7","1.12.8","1.13.0","1.13.1","1.5.0-rc2","1.8.0-rc1","1.9.0-rc0","1.9.0-rc1","v0.10.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.10","v0.13.14","v0.13.15","v0.13.16","v0.13.17","v0.13.18","v0.13.19","v0.13.2","v0.13.20","v0.13.21","v0.13.22","v0.13.25","v0.13.4","v0.13.5","v0.13.6","v0.13.8","v0.8.0","v0.8.2","v0.9.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc4","v1.0.0-rc5","v1.0.0-rc6","v1.0.0-rc7","v1.0.0-rc8","v1.0.0-rc9","v1.10.0-rc0","v1.11.0","v1.11.0-rc0","v1.11.0-rc1","v1.11.0-rc2","v1.11.0-rc3","v1.11.1","v1.11.10","v1.11.11","v1.11.12","v1.11.13","v1.11.14","v1.11.15","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.11.4","v1.11.5","v1.11.6","v1.11.7","v1.11.8","v1.11.9","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.12.3","v1.12.4","v1.12.5","v1.12.6","v1.12.7","v1.12.8","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.5.0-rc1","v1.5.0-rc2","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.6.0-rc2","v1.6.0-rc3","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.7.0-rc2","v1.8.0-rc1","v1.9.0-rc0","v1.9.0-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-30851.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/30xxx/CVE-2023-30851.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.11.16"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.12.9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.13.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-2h44-x2wx-49f4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30851"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-693"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/30xxx/CVE-2023-30851.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
