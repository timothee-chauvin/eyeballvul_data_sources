{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-56513","published":"2025-01-03T16:11:51.629Z","modified":"2025-11-20T06:34:09.918130Z","aliases":["GHSA-mg7w-c9x2-xh7r","GO-2025-3364"],"related":["SUSE-SU-2025:0060-1","openSUSE-SU-2025:14624-1"],"summary":"Karmada PULL Mode Cluster Privilege Escalation","details":"Karmada is a Kubernetes management system that allows users to run cloud-native applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters and clouds. Prior to version 1.12.0, the PULL mode clusters registered with the `karmadactl register` command have excessive privileges to access control plane resources. By abusing these permissions, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent to a karmada cluster would be able to obtain administrative privileges over the entire federation system including all registered member clusters. Since Karmada v1.12.0, command `karmadactl register` restricts the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources. This way, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent cannot control other member clusters in Karmada. As a workaround, one may restrict the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources according to Karmada Component Permissions Docs.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1bc955a23c655f15a7fd4c9f98d23c54991ea810"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.10.0-alpha.0","v1.10.0-preview1","v1.10.0-preview2","v1.10.0-preview3","v1.10.0-preview4","v1.11.0","v1.11.0-alpha.0","v1.12.0-alpha.0","v1.12.0-alpha.1","v1.12.0-beta.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-alpha.1","v1.7.0-alpha.2","v1.7.0-alpha.3","v1.8.0","v1.8.0-alpha.0","v1.8.0-alpha.1","v1.8.0-preview1","v1.8.0-preview2","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-alpha.0","v1.9.0-preview1","v1.9.0-preview2","v1.9.0-preview3","v1.9.0-preview4","v1.9.0-preview5","v1.9.0-preview6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-56513.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/commit/2c82055c4c7f469411b1ba48c4dba4841df04831"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/pull/5793"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/security/advisories/GHSA-mg7w-c9x2-xh7r"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://karmada.io/docs/administrator/security/component-permission"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-266"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
