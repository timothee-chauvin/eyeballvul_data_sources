{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-31033","published":"2024-04-01T02:15:07.850Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:34:58.845338Z","details":"JJWT (aka Java JWT) through 0.12.5 ignores certain characters and thus a user might falsely conclude that they have a strong key. The impacted code is the setSigningKey() method within the DefaultJwtParser class and the signWith() method within the DefaultJwtBuilder class. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the \"ignores\" behavior cannot occur (in any version) unless there is a user error in how JJWT is used, and because the version that was actually tested must have been more than six years out of date.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2399e2fdc5e20fad9d71d6bcbfd126cce6521638"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-31033.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.viralpatel.net/java-create-validate-jwt-token/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/issues/930#issuecomment-2032699358"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/2308652512/JJWT_BUG"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
