{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-43646","published":"2023-09-26T18:19:29Z","modified":"2025-11-04T19:33:17Z","aliases":["GHSA-4q6p-r6v2-jvc5"],"related":["CGA-6527-pf2q-fc57"],"summary":"Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in get-func-name","details":"get-func-name is a module to retrieve a function's name securely and consistently both in NodeJS and the browser. Versions prior to 2.0.1 are subject to a regular expression denial of service (redos) vulnerability which may lead to a denial of service when parsing malicious input. This vulnerability can be exploited when there is an imbalance in parentheses, which results in excessive backtracking and subsequently increases the CPU load and processing time significantly. This vulnerability can be triggered using the following input: '\\t'.repeat(54773) + '\\t/function/i'. This issue has been addressed in commit `f934b228b` which has been included in releases from 2.0.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/chaijs/get-func-name","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"27ad8ba2225ebc10292a82c619258ad8c042e638"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-43646.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/chaijs/get-func-name/commit/f934b228b5e2cb94d6c8576d3aac05493f667c69"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/chaijs/get-func-name/security/advisories/GHSA-4q6p-r6v2-jvc5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1333","CWE-400"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
