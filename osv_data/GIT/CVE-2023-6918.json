The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.com/libssh/libssh-mirror","events":[{"introduced":"79900e5246da9a1712d8822a53aaf5fd0abc6f40"},{"fixed":"d18bd233582a33f6768fe55148740fd6f9c3848c"}]}],"versions":["libssh-0.9.0","libssh-0.9.1","libssh-0.9.2","libssh-0.9.3","libssh-0.9.4","libssh-0.9.5","libssh-0.9.6","libssh-0.9.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-6918.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2504"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3233"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6918"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2254997"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.libssh.org/2023/12/18/libssh-0-10-6-and-libssh-0-9-8-security-releases/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2023-6918.txt"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250214-0009/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LZQVUHWVWRH73YBXUQJOD6CKHDQBU3DM/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MKQRBF3DWMWPH36LBCOBUTSIZRTPEZXB/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
