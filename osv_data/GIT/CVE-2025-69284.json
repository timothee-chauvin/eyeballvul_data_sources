In plane.io, a guest user doesn't have a permission to access https[:]//app[.]plane[.]so/[:]slug/settings. Prior to Plane version 1.2.0, a problem occurs when the `/api/workspaces/:slug/members/` is accessible by guest and able to list of users on a specific workspace that they joined. Since the `display_name` in the response is actually the handler of the email, a malicious guest can still identify admin users' email addresses. Version 1.2.0 fixes this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/makeplane/plane","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"248acdc4c13ce0c5bff157237f431acdec992119"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.2.0"}]}}],"versions":["v0.1-dev","v0.10-dev","v0.11-dev","v0.12-dev","v0.12.1-dev","v0.12.2-dev","v0.13-dev","v0.13.1-dev","v0.13.2-dev","v0.14-dev","v0.14.1-dev","v0.14.2-dev","v0.15-dev","v0.15.1-dev","v0.15.2-dev","v0.15.3-hotfix","v0.15.4-dev","v0.16-dev","v0.17-dev","v0.18-dev","v0.19-dev","v0.2-dev","v0.2.1-dev","v0.20-dev","v0.21-dev","v0.22-dev","v0.23.0","v0.23.1","v0.24.0","v0.24.1","v0.25.0","v0.25.1","v0.25.2","v0.25.3","v0.26.0","v0.26.1","v0.27.0","v0.27.1","v0.28.0","v0.3.1-dev","v0.4-dev","v0.5-dev","v0.6-dev","v0.7-dev","v0.7.1-dev","v0.8-dev","v0.9-dev","v1.0.0","v1.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-69284.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/69xxx/CVE-2025-69284.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/makeplane/plane/security/advisories/GHSA-7qx6-6739-c7qr"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69284"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-284"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/69xxx/CVE-2025-69284.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
