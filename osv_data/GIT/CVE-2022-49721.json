This is handled by ftrace_make_call() and ftrace_make_nop(),\nwith each having *almost* identical logic, but this is not handled by\nftrace_modify_call() since its introduction in commit:\n\n  3b23e4991fb66f6d (\"arm64: implement ftrace with regs\")\n\nDue to this, if we ever were to call ftrace_modify_call() for a callsite\nwhich requires a PLT entry for a trampoline, then either:\n\na) If the old addr requires a trampoline, ftrace_modify_call() will use\n   an out-of-range address to generate the 'old' branch instruction.\n   This will result in warnings from aarch64_insn_gen_branch_imm() and\n   ftrace_modify_code(), and no instructions will be modified. As\n   ftrace_modify_call() will return an error, this will result in\n   subsequent internal ftrace errors.\n\nb) If the old addr does not require a trampoline, but the new addr does,\n   ftrace_modify_call() will use an out-of-range address to generate the\n   'new' branch instruction. This will result in warnings from\n   aarch64_insn_gen_branch_imm(), and ftrace_modify_code() will replace\n   the 'old' branch with a BRK. This will result in a kernel panic when\n   this BRK is later executed.\n\nPractically speaking, case (a) is vastly more likely than case (b), and\ntypically this will result in internal ftrace errors that don't\nnecessarily affect the rest of the system. This can be demonstrated with\nan out-of-tree test module which triggers ftrace_modify_call(), e.g.\n\n| # insmod test_ftrace.ko\n| test_ftrace: Function test_function raw=0xffffb3749399201c,
