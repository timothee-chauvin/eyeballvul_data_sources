In versions prior to 8.0 There are cases where LAM instantiates objects from arbitrary classes. An attacker can inject the first constructor argument. This can lead to code execution if non-LAM classes are instantiated that execute code during object creation. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ldapaccountmanager/lam","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"cb97baae7b1aadffd1b54d0bbcb487a5ca769823"}]}],"versions":["lam_5_4","lam_5_4_RC1","lam_5_5","lam_5_5_RC1","lam_5_6","lam_5_6_RC1","lam_5_7","lam_5_7_RC1","lam_6_0","lam_6_0_1","lam_6_0_RC1","lam_6_0_RC2","lam_6_1","lam_6_1_RC1","lam_6_2","lam_6_2_1","lam_6_2_RC1","lam_6_3","lam_6_3_RC1","lam_6_4","lam_6_4_RC1","lam_6_5","lam_6_5_RC1","lam_6_6","lam_6_6_RC1","lam_6_7","lam_6_7_RC1","lam_6_8","lam_6_8_RC1","lam_6_9","lam_6_9_RC1","lam_7_0","lam_7_0_RC1","lam_7_1","lam_7_1_RC1","lam_7_2","lam_7_2_RC1","lam_7_3","lam_7_3_RC1","lam_7_4","lam_7_4_RC1","lam_7_5","lam_7_5_RC1","lam_7_6","lam_7_6_RC1","lam_7_7","lam_7_7_RC1","lam_7_8","lam_7_8_RC1","lam_7_9","lam_7_9_1","lam_7_9_RC1","lam_8_0_RC1","untagged-0f11e4b04e249cac51c5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31084.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/31xxx/CVE-2022-31084.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/commit/f1d5d04952f39a1b4ea203d3964fa88e1429dfd4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/security/advisories/GHSA-r387-grjx-qgvw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31084"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/exploiting-arbitrary-object-instantiations/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5177"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-88"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/31xxx/CVE-2022-31084.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
