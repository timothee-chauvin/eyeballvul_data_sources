This is wrong.\n\nWith this patch we restore the \"!= &nfsd_lease_mng_ops\" case to behave\nas it did before the change mentioned below.  This is the same as the\ncurrent code, but without any reference to a possible delegation.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"c5967721e1063648b0506481585ba7e2e49a075e"},{"fixed":"1b46a871e980e3daa16fd5e77539966492e8910a"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"c5967721e1063648b0506481585ba7e2e49a075e"},{"fixed":"40927f3d0972bf86357a32a5749be71a551241b6"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.10.1","v6.10.2","v6.10.3","v6.10.4","v6.10.5","v6.10.6","v6.10.7","v6.8","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-46690.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.9.0"},{"fixed":"6.10.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-46690.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1b46a871e980e3daa16fd5e77539966492e8910a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/40927f3d0972bf86357a32a5749be71a551241b6"}]}
