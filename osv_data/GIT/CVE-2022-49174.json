Then in this below loop it\naccesses memory beyond the block group bitmap buffer_head and results\ninto a data abort.\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < clen; i++)\n\t\tif (!mb_test_bit(blkoff + i, bitmap_bh->b_data) == !state)\n\t\t\talready++;\n\nThis patch adds this functionality for checking block group boundary in\next4_mb_mark_bb() and update the buffer_head(bitmap_bh) for every different\nblock group.\n\nw/o this patch, I was easily able to hit a data access abort using Power platform.\n\n<...>\n[   74.327662] EXT4-fs error (device loop3): ext4_mb_generate_buddy:1141: group
