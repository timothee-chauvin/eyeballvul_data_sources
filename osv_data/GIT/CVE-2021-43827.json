{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-43827","published":"2021-12-14T23:15:08.020Z","modified":"2025-11-19T17:35:22.628162Z","related":["GHSA-58vr-c56v-qr57"],"details":"discourse-footnote is a library providing footnotes for posts in Discourse. ### Impact When posting an inline footnote wrapped in `<a>` tags (e.g. `<a>^[footnote]</a>`, the resulting rendered HTML would include a nested `<a>`, which is stripped by Nokogiri because it is not valid. This then caused a javascript error on topic pages because we were looking for an `<a>` element inside the footnote reference span and getting its ID, and because it did not exist we got a null reference error in javascript. Users are advised to update to version 0.2. As a workaround editing offending posts from the rails console or the database console for self-hosters, or disabling the plugin in the admin panel can mitigate this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-footnote","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"796617e0131277011207541313522cd1946661ab"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-43827.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-footnote/commit/796617e0131277011207541313522cd1946661ab"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-footnote/security/advisories/GHSA-58vr-c56v-qr57"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
