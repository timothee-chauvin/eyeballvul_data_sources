In versions prior to 6.19.1 a SQL injection exploit exists related to replacements. Parameters which are passed through replacements are not properly escaped which can lead to arbitrary SQL injection depending on the specific queries in use. The issue has been fixed in Sequelize 6.19.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the `replacements` and the `where` option in the same query.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6c5f8ec550f75605814cf325c79d36ea4c98bc46"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.3","0.2.4","0.2.5","0.2.6","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.4.3","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.7.0-rc3","3.12.1","3.22.0","3.23.0","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-alpha","v1.5.0-beta","v1.5.0-beta-2","v1.5.1-alpha-1","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-alpha-1","v1.6.0-alpha-2","v1.6.0-alpha-3","v1.6.0-beta-1","v1.6.0-beta-2","v1.6.0-beta-3","v1.6.0-beta4","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-alpha1","v1.7.0-alpha2","v1.7.0-alpha3","v1.7.0-beta.0","v1.7.0-beta.1","v1.7.0-beta.2","v1.7.0-beta.3","v1.7.0-beta.3a","v1.7.0-beta.3b","v1.7.0-beta.4","v1.7.0-beta.4a","v1.7.0-beta.5","v1.7.0-beta6","v1.7.0-beta7","v1.7.0-beta8","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.7.0-rc2","v1.7.0-rc3","v1.7.0-rc4","v1.7.0-rc5","v1.7.0-rc6","v1.7.0-rc7","v1.7.0-rc8","v1.7.0-rc9","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha2","v2.0.0-alpha3","v2.0.0-beta.0","v2.0.0-beta.1","v2.0.0-beta.2","v2.0.0-beta.3","v2.0.0-beta.4","v2.0.0-beta.5","v2.0.0-beta.6","v2.0.0-beta.7","v2.0.0-beta.8","v2.0.0-dev1","v2.0.0-dev10","v2.0.0-dev11","v2.0.0-dev12","v2.0.0-dev13","v2.0.0-dev2","v2.0.0-dev3","v2.0.0-dev4","v2.0.0-dev5","v2.0.0-dev6","v2.0.0-dev7","v2.0.0-dev8","v2.0.0-dev9","v2.0.0-rc1","v2.0.0-rc2","v2.0.0-rc3","v2.0.0-rc4","v2.0.0-rc5","v2.0.0-rc6","v2.0.0-rc7","v2.0.0-rc8","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.10.0","v3.12.0","v3.12.2","v3.13.0","v3.14.0","v3.14.2","v3.15.0","v3.15.1","v3.16.0","v3.17.0","v3.17.1","v3.17.2","v3.17.3","v3.18.0","v3.19.0","v3.19.1","v3.19.2","v3.19.3","v3.2.0","v3.20.0","v3.21.0","v3.23.0","v3.23.1","v3.23.2","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.6.0","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.8.0","v3.9.0","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-0","v4.0.0-1","v4.0.0-2","v4.1.0","v4.10.0","v4.10.1","v4.10.2","v4.10.3","v4.11.0","v4.11.1","v4.11.2","v4.11.3","v4.11.4","v4.11.5","v4.11.6","v4.11.7","v4.12.0","v4.13.0","v4.13.1","v4.13.10","v4.13.11","v4.13.12","v4.13.13","v4.13.14","v4.13.15","v4.13.16","v4.13.17","v4.13.2","v4.13.3","v4.13.4","v4.13.5","v4.13.6","v4.13.7","v4.13.8","v4.13.9","v4.14.0","v4.15.0","v4.15.1","v4.15.2","v4.16.0","v4.16.1","v4.16.2","v4.17.0","v4.17.1","v4.17.2","v4.18.0","v4.19.0","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.20.0","v4.20.1","v4.20.2","v4.20.3","v4.21.0","v4.22.0","v4.22.1","v4.22.10","v4.22.11","v4.22.12","v4.22.13","v4.22.14","v4.22.15","v4.22.16","v4.22.2","v4.22.3","v4.22.4","v4.22.5","v4.22.6","v4.22.7","v4.22.8","v4.22.9","v4.23.0","v4.23.1","v4.23.2","v4.23.3","v4.23.4","v4.24.0","v4.25.0","v4.25.1","v4.25.2","v4.26.0","v4.27.0","v4.28.0","v4.28.1","v4.28.2","v4.28.3","v4.28.4","v4.28.5","v4.28.6","v4.28.7","v4.28.8","v4.29.0","v4.29.1","v4.29.2","v4.29.3","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.3.2","v4.30.0","v4.30.1","v4.30.2","v4.31.0","v4.31.1","v4.31.2","v4.32.0","v4.32.1","v4.32.2","v4.32.3","v4.32.4","v4.32.5","v4.32.6","v4.32.7","v4.33.0","v4.33.1","v4.33.2","v4.33.3","v4.33.4","v4.34.0","v4.34.1","v4.35.0","v4.35.1","v4.35.2","v4.35.3","v4.35.4","v4.35.5","v4.36.0","v4.36.1","v4.37.0","v4.37.1","v4.37.2","v4.37.3","v4.37.4","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.4.10","v4.4.2","v4.4.4","v4.4.5","v4.4.6","v4.4.7","v4.4.8","v4.4.9","v4.5.0","v4.6.0","v4.7.0","v4.7.1","v4.7.2","v4.7.3","v4.7.4","v4.7.5","v4.8.0","v4.8.1","v4.8.2","v4.8.3","v4.8.4","v4.9.0","v5.0.0-beta","v5.0.0-beta.1","v5.0.0-beta.10","v5.0.0-beta.11","v5.0.0-beta.12","v5.0.0-beta.13","v5.0.0-beta.14","v5.0.0-beta.15","v5.0.0-beta.16","v5.0.0-beta.17","v5.0.0-beta.2","v5.0.0-beta.3","v5.0.0-beta.4","v5.0.0-beta.5","v5.0.0-beta.6","v5.0.0-beta.7","v5.0.0-beta.8","v5.0.0-beta.9","v5.1.0","v5.1.1","v5.10.0","v5.10.1","v5.10.2","v5.10.3","v5.11.0","v5.12.0","v5.12.1","v5.12.2","v5.12.3","v5.13.0","v5.13.1","v5.14.0","v5.15.0","v5.15.1","v5.15.2","v5.16.0","v5.17.0","v5.17.1","v5.17.2","v5.18.0","v5.18.1","v5.18.2","v5.18.3","v5.18.4","v5.19.0","v5.19.1","v5.19.2","v5.19.3","v5.19.4","v5.19.5","v5.19.6","v5.19.7","v5.19.8","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.2.10","v5.2.11","v5.2.12","v5.2.13","v5.2.14","v5.2.15","v5.2.2","v5.2.3","v5.2.4","v5.2.5","v5.2.6","v5.2.7","v5.2.8","v5.2.9","v5.20.0","v5.21.0","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.3.3","v5.3.4","v5.3.5","v5.4.0","v5.5.0","v5.5.1","v5.6.0","v5.6.1","v5.7.0","v5.7.1","v5.7.2","v5.7.3","v5.7.4","v5.7.5","v5.7.6","v5.8.0","v5.8.1","v5.8.10","v5.8.11","v5.8.12","v5.8.2","v5.8.3","v5.8.4","v5.8.5","v5.8.6","v5.8.7","v5.8.8","v5.8.9","v5.9.0","v5.9.1","v5.9.2","v5.9.3","v5.9.4","v5.9.5","v6.0.0-beta.2","v6.0.0-beta.3","v6.0.0-beta.4","v6.0.0-beta.5","v6.0.0-beta.6","v6.0.0-beta.7","v6.1.0","v6.1.1","v6.10.0","v6.11.0","v6.12.0","v6.12.0-alpha.1","v6.12.0-beta.1","v6.12.0-beta.2","v6.12.0-beta.3","v6.12.1","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.13.0","v6.14.0","v6.14.1","v
