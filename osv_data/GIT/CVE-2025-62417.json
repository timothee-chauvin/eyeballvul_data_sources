{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62417","published":"2025-10-16T18:32:45Z","modified":"2025-11-06T02:53:53.260708Z","aliases":["GHSA-jqrp-58fv-w8cq"],"summary":"bagisto - CSV Formula Injection in Create New Product","details":"Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. When product data that begins with a spreadsheet formula character (for example =, +, -, or @) is accepted and later exported or saved into a CSV and opened in spreadsheet software, the spreadsheet will interpret that cell as a formula. This allows an attacker to supply a CSV field (e.g., product name) that contains a formula which may be evaluated by a victim’s spreadsheet application — potentially leading to data exfiltration and remote command execution (via older Excel exploits / OLE/cmd constructs or Excel macros). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.8.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2886bcc0cd665116b7482f81d1ee87194f01702f"}]}],"versions":["1.4.0","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.4-BETA1","v0.1.4-BETA2","v0.1.4-BETA3","v0.1.4-BETA4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.6-ALPHA1","v0.1.7","v0.1.7-BETA1","v0.1.7-BETA2","v0.1.8","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-BETA1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-BETA1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-BETA-1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.10","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.2.5","v2.2.6","v2.2.7","v2.2.8","v2.2.9","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62417.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto/security/advisories/GHSA-jqrp-58fv-w8cq"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1236"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
