A path traversal vulnerability impacts npm (server) users of Moment.js between versions 1.0.1 and 2.29.1, especially if a user-provided locale string is directly used to switch moment locale. This problem is patched in 2.29.2, and the patch can be applied to all affected versions. As a workaround, sanitize the user-provided locale name before passing it to Moment.js.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/moment/moment","events":[{"introduced":"a0c5b6e599835acc37f9eeb143a2fba1043ac244"},{"fixed":"75e2ac573e8cd62086a6bc6dc1b8d271e2804391"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.7.0","1.7.1","1.7.2","2.0.0","2.1.0","2.10.2","2.10.3","2.10.5","2.10.6","2.11.0","2.11.1","2.11.2","2.12.0","2.13.0","2.14.0","2.14.1","2.15.0","2.15.1","2.15.2","2.16.0","2.17.0","2.17.1","2.18.0","2.18.1","2.19.0","2.19.1","2.19.2","2.19.3","2.19.4","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.20.0","2.20.1","2.21.0","2.22.0","2.22.1","2.22.2","2.23.0","2.24.0","2.25.0","2.25.1","2.25.2","2.25.3","2.26.0","2.27.0","2.28.0","2.29.0","2.29.1","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.4.0","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.6.0","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.8.2","2.8.3","2.8.4","2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24785.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/moment/moment/commit/4211bfc8f15746be4019bba557e29a7ba83d54c5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-8hfj-j24r-96c4"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00035.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6QIO6YNLTK2T7SPKDS4JEL45FANLNC2Q/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ORJX2LF6KMPIHP6B2P6KZIVKMLE3LVJ5/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220513-0006/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241108-0002/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2022-09"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-27"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
