{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-43864","published":"2025-04-25T00:18:16Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:46:08.073126Z","aliases":["GHSA-f46r-rw29-r322"],"summary":"React Router allows a DoS via cache poisoning by forcing SPA mode","details":"React Router is a router for React. Starting in version 7.2.0 and prior to version 7.5.2, it is possible to force an application to switch to SPA mode by adding a header to the request. If the application uses SSR and is forced to switch to SPA, this causes an error that completely corrupts the page. If a cache system is in place, this allows the response containing the error to be cached, resulting in a cache poisoning that strongly impacts the availability of the application. This issue has been patched in version 7.5.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router","events":[{"introduced":"4b5793dc97dd8f72c56b761427a371f102858434"},{"fixed":"5819e0c45df69a0b4ac582497e5adb1c089385b5"}]}],"versions":["@react-router/architect@7.2.0","@react-router/architect@7.3.0","@react-router/architect@7.4.0","@react-router/architect@7.4.1","@react-router/architect@7.5.0","@react-router/architect@7.5.1","@react-router/cloudflare@7.2.0","@react-router/cloudflare@7.3.0","@react-router/cloudflare@7.4.0","@react-router/cloudflare@7.4.1","@react-router/cloudflare@7.5.0","@react-router/cloudflare@7.5.1","@react-router/dev@7.2.0","@react-router/dev@7.3.0","@react-router/dev@7.4.0","@react-router/dev@7.4.1","@react-router/dev@7.5.0","@react-router/dev@7.5.1","@react-router/express@7.2.0","@react-router/express@7.3.0","@react-router/express@7.4.0","@react-router/express@7.4.1","@react-router/express@7.5.0","@react-router/express@7.5.1","@react-router/fs-routes@7.2.0","@react-router/fs-routes@7.3.0","@react-router/fs-routes@7.4.0","@react-router/fs-routes@7.4.1","@react-router/fs-routes@7.5.0","@react-router/fs-routes@7.5.1","@react-router/node@7.2.0","@react-router/node@7.3.0","@react-router/node@7.4.0","@react-router/node@7.4.1","@react-router/node@7.5.0","@react-router/node@7.5.1","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.2.0","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.3.0","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.4.0","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.4.1","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.5.0","@react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter@7.5.1","@react-router/serve@7.2.0","@react-router/serve@7.3.0","@react-router/serve@7.4.0","@react-router/serve@7.4.1","@react-router/serve@7.5.0","@react-router/serve@7.5.1","create-react-router@7.2.0","create-react-router@7.3.0","create-react-router@7.4.0","create-react-router@7.4.1","create-react-router@7.5.0","create-react-router@7.5.1","react-router-dom@7.2.0","react-router-dom@7.3.0","react-router-dom@7.4.0","react-router-dom@7.4.1","react-router-dom@7.5.0","react-router-dom@7.5.1","react-router@7.2.0","react-router@7.3.0","react-router@7.4.0","react-router@7.4.1","react-router@7.5.0","react-router@7.5.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-43864.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/security/advisories/GHSA-f46r-rw29-r322"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/commit/c84302972a152d851cf5dd859ff332b354b70111"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/e6c53a0130559b4a9bd47f9cf76ea5b08a69868a/packages/react-router/lib/server-runtime/server.ts#L407"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-755"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
