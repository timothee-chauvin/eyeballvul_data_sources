{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-21641","published":"2024-01-05T21:02:56Z","modified":"2025-11-15T04:21:51.615711Z","aliases":["GHSA-733r-8xcp-w9mr"],"summary":"Flarum's Logout Route allows open redirects","details":"Flarum is open source discussion platform software. Prior to version 1.8.5, the Flarum `/logout` route includes a redirect parameter that allows any third party to redirect users from a (trusted) domain of the Flarum installation to redirect to any link. For logged-in users, the logout must be confirmed. Guests are immediately redirected. This could be used by spammers to redirect to a web address using a trusted domain of a running Flarum installation. The vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core v1.8.5. As a workaround, some extensions modifying the logout route can remedy this issue if their implementation is safe.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/flarum/core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2a693db1b65cf7b0f7e76cbaa695a5e65bd947f6"}]}],"versions":["v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-21641.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/flarum/flarum-core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ee8b3b4ad1413a2b0971fdd9e40f812d2a3a9d3a"}]}],"versions":["v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-21641.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/flarum/framework","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7d70328471cf3091d92d95c382d277aec7996176"}]}],"versions":["v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-21641.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/flarum/flarum-core/commit/ee8b3b4ad1413a2b0971fdd9e40f812d2a3a9d3a"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/flarum/framework/commit/7d70328471cf3091d92d95c382d277aec7996176"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/flarum/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-733r-8xcp-w9mr"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
