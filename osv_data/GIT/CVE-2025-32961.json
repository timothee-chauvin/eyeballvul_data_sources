Prior to version 1.1.1, the input parameter, which consists of a file path and name, can be manipulated to return the Content-Type header with text/html if the name part ends with .html. This could allow malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the browser. For a successful attack, a malicious file needs to be uploaded beforehand. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.1. A workaround is provided on the Jmix documentation website.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cuba-platform/jpawebapi","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"475f40b12b3604844408b756f6e8991a8074fea0"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-32961.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html#disable-files-endpoint-in-cuba-application"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cuba-platform/jpawebapi/commit/78b837d7e2b12d0df69cef1bc6042ebf3bdaf22c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cuba-platform/jpawebapi/security/advisories/GHSA-hg25-w3vg-7279"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
