This avoids a possible out-of-bounds access on the pivot\narray if the write extends to the last slot in the node, in which case the\nnode maximum should be used as the end pivot.\n\nakpm: this doesn't affect any current callers, but new users of mapletree\nmay encounter this problem if backported into earlier kernels, so let's\nfix it in -stable kernels in case of this.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"54a611b605901c7d5d05b6b8f5d04a6ceb0962aa"},{"fixed":"4e2ad53ababeaac44d71162650984abfe783960c"},{"fixed":"dc4751bd4aba01ccfc02f91adfeee0ba4cda405c"},{"fixed":"f5fcf6555a2a4f32947d17b92b173837cc652891"},{"fixed":"cd00dd2585c4158e81fdfac0bbcc0446afbad26d"}]}],"versions":["v6.0","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.3.1","v6.3.10","v6.3.2","v6.3.3","v6.3.4","v6.3.5","v6.3.6","v6.3.7","v6.3.8","v6.3.9","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54135.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.1.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.37"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.3.11"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.4.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54135.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4e2ad53ababeaac44d71162650984abfe783960c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cd00dd2585c4158e81fdfac0bbcc0446afbad26d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dc4751bd4aba01ccfc02f91adfeee0ba4cda405c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f5fcf6555a2a4f32947d17b92b173837cc652891"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54135.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54135"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54135.json"}}
