An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type `unsigned long`. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-69.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/imagemagick/imagemagick6","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2c5f5682debda960a421db2055fd7bca04e3f356"}]}],"versions":["6.9.10-0","6.9.10-1","6.9.10-10","6.9.10-11","6.9.10-12","6.9.10-13","6.9.10-14","6.9.10-15","6.9.10-16","6.9.10-17","6.9.10-18","6.9.10-19","6.9.10-2","6.9.10-20","6.9.10-21","6.9.10-22","6.9.10-23","6.9.10-24","6.9.10-25","6.9.10-26","6.9.10-27","6.9.10-28","6.9.10-29","6.9.10-3","6.9.10-30","6.9.10-31","6.9.10-32","6.9.10-33","6.9.10-34","6.9.10-35","6.9.10-36","6.9.10-37","6.9.10-38","6.9.10-39","6.9.10-4","6.9.10-40","6.9.10-41","6.9.10-42","6.9.10-43","6.9.10-44","6.9.10-45","6.9.10-46","6.9.10-47","6.9.10-48","6.9.10-49","6.9.10-5","6.9.10-50","6.9.10-51","6.9.10-52","6.9.10-53","6.9.10-54","6.9.10-55","6.9.10-56","6.9.10-57","6.9.10-58","6.9.10-59","6.9.10-6","6.9.10-60","6.9.10-61","6.9.10-62","6.9.10-63","6.9.10-64","6.9.10-65","6.9.10-66","6.9.10-67","6.9.10-68","6.9.10-7","6.9.10-8","6.9.10-9","6.9.4-0","6.9.4-1","6.9.4-10","6.9.4-2","6.9.4-3","6.9.4-4","6.9.4-5","6.9.4-6","6.9.4-7","6.9.4-8","6.9.4-9","6.9.5-0","6.9.5-1","6.9.5-10","6.9.5-2","6.9.5-3","6.9.5-4","6.9.5-5","6.9.5-6","6.9.5-7","6.9.5-8","6.9.5-9","6.9.6-0","6.9.6-1","6.9.6-2","6.9.6-3","6.9.6-4","6.9.6-5","6.9.6-6","6.9.6-7","6.9.6-8","6.9.7-0","6.9.7-1","6.9.7-10","6.9.7-2","6.9.7-3","6.9.7-4","6.9.7-5","6.9.7-6","6.9.7-7","6.9.7-8","6.9.7-9","6.9.8-0","6.9.8-1","6.9.8-10","6.9.8-2","6.9.8-3","6.9.8-4","6.9.8-5","6.9.8-6","6.9.8-7","6.9.8-8","6.9.8-9","6.9.9-0","6.9.9-1","6.9.9-10","6.9.9-11","6.9.9-12","6.9.9-13","6.9.9-14","6.9.9-15","6.9.9-17","6.9.9-18","6.9.9-19","6.9.9-2","6.9.9-20","6.9.9-21","6.9.9-22","6.9.9-23","6.9.9-24","6.9.9-25","6.9.9-26","6.9.9-27","6.9.9-28","6.9.9-29","6.9.9-3","6.9.9-30","6.9.9-31","6.9.9-32","6.9.9-33","6.9.9-34","6.9.9-35","6.9.9-36","6.9.9-37","6.9.9-38","6.9.9-39","6.9.9-4","6.9.9-40","6.9.9-41","6.9.9-42","6.9.9-43","6.9.9-44","6.9.9-45","6.9.9-46","6.9.9-47","6.9.9-48","6.9.9-49","6.9.9-5","6.9.9-50","6.9.9-51","6.9.9-6","6.9.9-7","6.9.9-8","6.9.9-9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-27766.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/03/msg00008.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1894686"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00030.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
