If an ICMPv4 error packet is received as the first packet on a flow in the to_client direction, it confuses the rule grouping lookup logic. The toclient inspection will then continue with the wrong rule group. This can lead to missed detection.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ae116871ad13bd132df9ff69a27a32b7484edae7"}]}],"versions":["suricata-0.8.2","suricata-1.0.0","suricata-1.0.1","suricata-1.0.2","suricata-1.1","suricata-1.1beta1","suricata-1.1beta2","suricata-1.1beta3","suricata-1.1rc1","suricata-1.2","suricata-1.2.1","suricata-1.2beta1","suricata-1.2rc1","suricata-1.3","suricata-1.3.1","suricata-1.3beta1","suricata-1.3beta2","suricata-1.3rc1","suricata-1.4","suricata-1.4beta1","suricata-1.4beta2","suricata-1.4beta3","suricata-1.4rc1","suricata-2.0","suricata-2.0.1","suricata-2.0.1rc1","suricata-2.0.2","suricata-2.0beta1","suricata-2.0beta2","suricata-2.0rc1","suricata-2.0rc2","suricata-2.0rc3","suricata-2.1beta1","suricata-2.1beta2","suricata-2.1beta3","suricata-2.1beta4","suricata-3.0","suricata-3.0.1","suricata-3.0.1RC1","suricata-3.0RC1","suricata-3.0RC2","suricata-3.0RC3","suricata-3.1","suricata-3.1.1","suricata-3.1RC1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2016-10728.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/kirillwow/ids_bypass"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/09/msg00019.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/1880"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://suricata-ids.org/2016/09/07/suricata-3-1-2-released/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
