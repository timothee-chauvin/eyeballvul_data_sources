{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-22115","published":"2022-01-10T16:15:09.993Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:01:28.859608Z","details":"In Teedy, versions v1.5 through v1.9 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the name of a created Tag. Since the Tag name is not being sanitized properly in the edit tag page, a low privileged attacker can store malicious scripts in the name of the Tag. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account Takeover of the administrator, and privileges escalation.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sismics/docs","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4951229576d6892dc58ab8c572e73639ca82d80c"}]}],"versions":["v1.0","v1.1","v1.2","v1.3","v1.4","v1.5","v1.6","v1.7","v1.8","v1.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-22115.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sismics/docs/commit/4951229576d6892dc58ab8c572e73639ca82d80c"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-22115"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
