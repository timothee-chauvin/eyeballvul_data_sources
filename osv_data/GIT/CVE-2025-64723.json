Prior to version 2.3.7, Arduino IDE for macOS was configured with overly permissive security entitlements that could bypass macOS Hardened Runtime protections. This configuration allows attackers to inject malicious dynamic libraries into the application process, gaining access to all TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permissions granted to the application. The fix is included starting from the `2.3.7 ` release.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2bfd24338c3c484a063fb91e6920c718a811ec0c"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.1.2","0.1.3","2.0.0","2.0.0-beta.1","2.0.0-beta.10","2.0.0-beta.11","2.0.0-beta.12","2.0.0-beta.2","2.0.0-beta.3","2.0.0-beta.4","2.0.0-beta.5","2.0.0-beta.6","2.0.0-beta.7","2.0.0-beta.8","2.0.0-beta.9","2.0.0-rc1","2.0.0-rc2","2.0.0-rc3","2.0.0-rc4","2.0.0-rc5","2.0.0-rc6","2.0.0-rc7","2.0.0-rc8","2.0.0-rc9","2.0.0-rc9.1","2.0.0-rc9.2","2.0.0-rc9.3","2.0.0-rc9.4","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.1.0","2.3.0","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.3.5","2.3.6","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64723.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64723.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/pull/2805/commits/2f7667136ee95ce07dde23c49d2de526b45e3293"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/releases/tag/2.3.7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/security/advisories/GHSA-vf5j-xhwq-8vqj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64723"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/24329484618652-ASEC-25-004-Arduino-IDE-v2-3-7-Resolves-Multiple-Vulnerabilities"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-276"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64723.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
