{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-38537","published":"2024-07-02T19:50:10Z","modified":"2025-11-11T03:03:25.947209Z","aliases":["GHSA-cvw4-c69g-7v7m"],"summary":"Inclusion of Untrusted polyfill.io Code Vulnerability in fides.js","details":"Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. `fides.js`, a client-side script used to interact with the consent management features of Fides, used the `polyfill.io` domain in a very limited edge case, when it detected a legacy browser such as IE11 that did not support the fetch standard. Therefore it was possible for users of legacy, pre-2017 browsers who navigate to a page serving `fides.js` to download and execute malicious scripts from the `polyfill.io` domain when the domain was compromised and serving malware. No exploitation of `fides.js` via `polyfill.io` has been identified as of time of publication.\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.39.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. On Thursday, June 27, 2024, Cloudflare and Namecheap intervened at a domain level to ensure `polyfill.io` and its subdomains could not resolve to the compromised service, rendering this vulnerability unexploitable. Prior to the domain level intervention, there were no server-side workarounds and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts of this vulnerability were high. Clients could ensure they were not affected by using a modern browser that supported the fetch standard.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ethyca/fides","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c62b1f10cb72bcd2e6517ce4dd0bf3f15310d9de"}]}],"versions":["0.9.0","0.9.1","0.9.2","0.9.3","0.9.4","0.9.5","0.9.6","0.9.7","0.9.8","0.9.8.1","0.9.8.2","0.9.8.3","0.9.8.4","0.9.9","1.0.0","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.6.0","1.7.0","1.8.0","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.9.0","1.9.1","1.9.2","1.9.9","2.0.0","2.0.0-beta.1","2.0.0-beta.2","2.0.0-beta.3","2.10.1b0","2.10.1b1","2.10.1b2","2.10.1b3","2.11.1b0","2.11.1b1","2.11.1b2","2.11.1b3","2.11.1b4","2.11.1b5","2.11.1b6","2.12.1b0","2.12.1b1","2.12.1b2","2.12.1b3","2.12.1b4","2.12.2b0","2.12.2b1","2.12.2b2","2.13.1b0","2.13.1b1","2.13.1b2","2.14.1b0","2.14.1b1","2.14.1b2","2.14.2b0","2.14.3b0","2.15.1b0","2.15.1b1","2.15.2b0","2.16.1b0","2.16.1b1","2.17.1b0","2.18.1b0","2.18.1b1","2.18.1b2","2.18.1b3","2.18.1b4","2.18.1b5","2.18.1b6","2.18.1b7","2.19.1b0","2.19.2b0","2.19.2b1","2.19.2b2","2.2.0","2.2.2","2.20.1b0","2.20.1b1","2.20.1b2","2.20.1b3","2.20.1b4","2.20.2b0","2.20.3b0","2.20.3b1","2.20.3b2","2.21.0rc0","2.21.1b0","2.21.1b1","2.21.1b2","2.21.1b3","2.22.1b0","2.22.1b1","2.22.1b2","2.22.1b3","2.22.2b0","2.22.2b1","2.22.2b2","2.22.2b3","2.23.1b0","2.23.2b0","2.23.3b0","2.23.3b1","2.23.3b2","2.23.3b3","2.24.1b0","2.24.1b1","2.24.2b0","2.24.2b1","2.25.1b0","2.25.1b1","2.25.1b2","2.25.1b3","2.25.1b4","2.26.1b0","2.26.1b1","2.27.1b0","2.27.1b1","2.28.1b0","2.28.1b1","2.29.1b0","2.29.1b1","2.3.0","2.30.1b0","2.30.2b0","2.30.2b1","2.31.1b0","2.31.1b2","2.32.1b0","2.32.1b1","2.32.1b2","2.33.1b0","2.33.2b0","2.34.1b0","2.34.2b0","2.34.2b1","2.34.2b2","2.34.2b3","2.35.2b0","2.35.2b1","2.36.1b0","2.36.2b0","2.36.2b1","2.36.2b2","2.36.2b3","2.36.2b4","2.36.2b5","2.37.1b0","2.37.1b1","2.37.1b2","2.37.1b3","2.37.1b4","2.38.1b0","2.38.1b1","2.38.2b0","2.38.2b1","2.38.2b2","2.38.2b3","2.39.0","2.39.0rc0","2.39.0rc2","2.39.1rc0","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.9.0","2.9.0rc3","2.9.3a0","2.9.4","fetch"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-38537.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/868c4d629760572192bd61db34f5a4458ed12005"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ethyca/fides/pull/5026"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-cvw4-c69g-7v7m"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-829"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N"}]}
