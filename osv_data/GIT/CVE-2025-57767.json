{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-57767","published":"2025-08-28T15:33:00.087Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:40:06.733514Z","aliases":["GHSA-64qc-9x89-rx5j"],"summary":"Asterisk can crash from a specifically malformed Authorization header in an incoming SIP request","details":"Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit. Prior to versions 20.15.2, 21.10.2, and 22.5.2, if a SIP request is received with an Authorization header that contains a realm that wasn't in a previous 401 response's WWW-Authenticate header, or an Authorization header with an incorrect realm was received without a previous 401 response being sent, the get_authorization_header() function in res_pjsip_authenticator_digest will return a NULL. This wasn't being checked before attempting to get the digest algorithm from the header which causes a SEGV. This issue has been patched in versions 20.15.2, 21.10.2, and 22.5.2. There are no workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a4b54349a1bce79c06696305ca0b658f90477877"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"22.5.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"dc6416062db89287ad9b35f8f7780acd7146b0c6"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"21.10.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f34af3980567b3616ecd49730408bb6dff792de9"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20.15.2"}]}}],"versions":["20.10.0","20.10.0-rc1","20.10.0-rc2","20.11.0","20.11.0-rc1","20.11.1","20.12.0","20.12.0-rc1","20.12.0-rc2","20.13.0","20.13.0-rc1","20.14.0","20.14.0-rc1","20.15.0","20.15.0-rc1","20.15.0-rc2","20.15.0-rc3","20.15.1","20.2.0","20.2.0-rc1","20.2.1","20.3.0","20.3.0-rc1","20.3.1","20.4.0","20.4.0-rc1","20.4.0-rc2","20.5.0","20.5.0-rc1","20.5.1","20.5.2","20.6.0","20.6.0-rc1","20.6.0-rc2","20.7.0","20.7.0-rc1","20.7.0-rc2","20.8.0","20.8.0-rc1","20.8.1","20.9.0","20.9.0-rc1","20.9.1","20.9.2","20.9.3","21.0.0","21.0.0-pre1","21.0.0-rc1","21.0.1","21.0.2","21.1.0","21.1.0-rc1","21.1.0-rc2","21.10.0","21.10.0-rc1","21.10.0-rc2","21.10.0-rc3","21.10.1","21.2.0","21.2.0-rc1","21.2.0-rc2","21.3.0","21.3.0-rc1","21.3.1","21.4.0","21.4.0-rc1","21.4.1","21.4.2","21.4.3","21.5.0","21.5.0-rc1","21.5.0-rc2","21.6.0","21.6.0-rc1","21.6.1","21.7.0","21.7.0-rc1","21.7.0-rc2","21.8.0","21.8.0-rc1","21.9.0","21.9.0-rc1","22.0.0","22.0.0-pre1","22.0.0-rc1","22.0.0-rc2","22.1.0","22.1.0-rc1","22.1.1","22.2.0","22.2.0-rc1","22.2.0-rc2","22.3.0","22.3.0-rc1","22.4.0","22.4.0-rc1","22.5.0","22.5.0-rc1","22.5.0-rc2","22.5.0-rc3","22.5.1","certified-20.7-cert1-pre1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-57767.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/02993717b08f899d4aca9888062f35dfb198584f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/pull/1407"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/security/advisories/GHSA-64qc-9x89-rx5j"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-253"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
