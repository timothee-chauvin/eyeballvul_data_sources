In versions 15.0.14 and below, 16.0.0 through 16.0.26.4 and  17.0.0 through 17.0.5, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in FreePBX allows a low-privileged User Control Panel (UCP) user to inject malicious JavaScript into the system. The malicious code executes in the context of an administrator when they interact with the affected component, leading to session hijacking and potential privilege escalation. This issue is fixed in versions 15.0.14, 16.0.27 and 17.0.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freepbx/contactmanager","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"30bfae293a45e4c670687522d6d1bb4fadb443f1"}]}],"versions":["release/12.0.0alpha2","release/12.0.0alpha3","release/12.0.0beta1","release/12.0.0beta10","release/12.0.0beta11","release/12.0.0beta12","release/12.0.0beta13","release/12.0.0beta14","release/12.0.0beta2","release/12.0.0beta3","release/12.0.0beta4","release/12.0.0beta5","release/12.0.0beta6","release/12.0.0beta7","release/12.0.0beta8","release/12.0.0beta9","release/12.0.2","release/12.0.3","release/12.0.4","release/12.0.5","release/13.0.0beta1","release/13.0.0beta2","release/13.0.0beta3","release/13.0.0beta4","release/13.0.0beta5","release/13.0.10","release/13.0.11","release/13.0.12","release/13.0.13","release/13.0.14","release/13.0.15","release/13.0.16","release/13.0.17","release/13.0.2","release/13.0.20","release/13.0.21","release/13.0.22","release/13.0.23","release/13.0.24","release/13.0.25","release/13.0.26","release/13.0.27","release/13.0.28","release/13.0.29","release/13.0.3","release/13.0.30","release/13.0.31","release/13.0.32","release/13.0.33","release/13.0.34","release/13.0.35","release/13.0.36","release/13.0.37","release/13.0.38","release/13.0.4","release/13.0.40","release/13.0.41","release/13.0.41.10","release/13.0.41.11","release/13.0.41.12","release/13.0.41.13","release/13.0.41.14","release/13.0.41.3","release/13.0.41.4","release/13.0.41.5","release/13.0.41.6","release/13.0.41.7","release/13.0.41.8","release/13.0.42","release/13.0.42.1","release/13.0.42.10","release/13.0.42.11","release/13.0.42.12","release/13.0.42.13","release/13.0.42.2","release/13.0.42.3","release/13.0.42.4","release/13.0.42.5","release/13.0.42.7","release/13.0.42.8","release/13.0.42.9","release/13.0.43","release/13.0.43.1","release/13.0.43.10","release/13.0.43.11","release/13.0.43.12","release/13.0.43.13","release/13.0.43.2","release/13.0.43.3","release/13.0.43.4","release/13.0.43.5","release/13.0.43.6","release/13.0.43.7","release/13.0.43.8","release/13.0.43.9","release/13.0.44","release/13.0.5","release/13.0.6","release/13.0.8","release/13.0.9","release/14.0.1","release/14.0.1.1","release/14.0.1alpha1","release/14.0.1alpha2","release/14.0.1beta1","release/14.0.1beta2","release/14.0.1beta3","release/14.0.2","release/14.0.3","release/14.0.3.1","release/14.0.3.2","release/14.0.3.3","release/14.0.3.4","release/14.0.3.5","release/14.0.3.6","release/14.0.3.7","release/14.0.4","release/14.0.4.1","release/14.0.4.10","release/14.0.4.11","release/14.0.4.12","release/14.0.4.13","release/14.0.4.2","release/14.0.4.3","release/14.0.4.4","release/14.0.4.5","release/14.0.4.6","release/14.0.4.7","release/14.0.4.8","release/14.0.4.9","release/14.0.5","release/14.0.5.1","release/14.0.5.10","release/14.0.5.11","release/14.0.5.12","release/14.0.5.13","release/14.0.5.14","release/14.0.5.15","release/14.0.5.16","release/14.0.5.17","release/14.0.5.18","release/14.0.5.19","release/14.0.5.2","release/14.0.5.3","release/14.0.5.4","release/14.0.5.5","release/14.0.5.6","release/14.0.5.7","release/14.0.5.8","release/14.0.5.9","release/15.0.10","release/15.0.11","release/15.0.12","release/15.0.13","release/15.0.2","release/15.0.3","release/15.0.4","release/15.0.5","release/15.0.6","release/15.0.7","release/15.0.8","release/15.0.8.1","release/15.0.8.10","release/15.0.8.11","release/15.0.8.12","release/15.0.8.13","release/15.0.8.14","release/15.0.8.15","release/15.0.8.16","release/15.0.8.17","release/15.0.8.18","release/15.0.8.19","release/15.0.8.2","release/15.0.8.20","release/15.0.8.21","release/15.0.8.22","release/15.0.8.23","release/15.0.8.24","release/15.0.8.25","release/15.0.8.26","release/15.0.8.27","release/15.0.8.28","release/15.0.8.29","release/15.0.8.3","release/15.0.8.30","release/15.0.8.31","release/15.0.8.32","release/15.0.8.33","release/15.0.8.34","release/15.0.8.35","release/15.0.8.36","release/15.0.8.37","release/15.0.8.38","release/15.0.8.39","release/15.0.8.4","release/15.0.8.40","release/15.0.8.41","release/15.0.8.42","release/15.0.8.43","release/15.0.8.44","release/15.0.8.45","release/15.0.8.46","release/15.0.8.47","release/15.0.8.48","release/15.0.8.49","release/15.0.8.5","release/15.0.8.50","release/15.0.8.51","release/15.0.8.52","release/15.0.8.53","release/15.0.8.54","release/15.0.8.55","release/15.0.8.56","release/15.0.8.57","release/15.0.8.58","release/15.0.8.6","release/15.0.8.7","release/15.0.8.8","release/15.0.8.9","release/15.0.9","release/15.0.9.1","release/15.0.9.10","release/15.0.9.11","release/15.0.9.12","release/15.0.9.13","release/15.0.9.2","release/15.0.9.3","release/15.0.9.4","release/15.0.9.5","release/15.0.9.6","release/15.0.9.7","release/15.0.9.8","release/15.0.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-55209.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/FreePBX/contactmanager/commit/55abba0f1ab5d66ba87732fd06179231d1f68184"},{"type":"ADVISOR
