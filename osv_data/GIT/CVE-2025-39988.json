The only check\nwhich is performed by the PF_PACKET framework is to make sure that\nskb->len fits the interface's MTU.\n\nUnfortunately, because the etas_es58x driver does not populate its\nnet_device_ops->ndo_change_mtu(), it is possible for an attacker to\nconfigure an invalid MTU by doing, for example:\n\n  $ ip link set can0 mtu 9999\n\nAfter doing so, the attacker could open a PF_PACKET socket using the\nETH_P_CANXL protocol:\n\n\tsocket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_CANXL));\n\nto inject a malicious CAN XL frames. For example:\n\n\tstruct canxl_frame frame = {\n\t\t.flags = 0xff,\n\t\t.len = 2048,\n\t};\n\nThe CAN drivers' xmit() function are calling can_dev_dropped_skb() to\ncheck that the skb is valid, unfortunately under above conditions, the\nmalicious packet is able to go through can_dev_dropped_skb() checks:\n\n  1. the skb->protocol is set to ETH_P_CANXL which is valid (the\n     function does not check the actual device capabilities).\n\n  2. the length is a valid CAN XL length.\n\nAnd so, es58x_start_xmit() receives a CAN XL frame which it is not\nable to correctly handle and will thus misinterpret it as a CAN(FD)\nframe.\n\nThis can result in a buffer overflow. For example, using the es581.4\nvariant, the frame will be dispatched to es581_4_tx_can_msg(), go\nthrough the last check at the beginning of this function:\n\n\tif (can_is_canfd_skb(skb))\n\t\treturn -EMSGSIZE;\n\nand reach this line:\n\n\tmemcpy(tx_can_msg->data, cf->data, cf->len);\n\nHere, cf->len corresponds to the flags field of the CAN XL frame. In\nour previous example, we set canxl_frame->flags to 0xff. Because the\nmaximum expected length is 8, a buffer overflow of 247 bytes occurs!\n\nPopulate net_device_ops->ndo_change_mtu() to ensure that the\ninterface's MTU can not be set to anything bigger than CAN_MTU or\nCANFD_MTU (depending on the device capabilities). By fixing the root\ncause, this prevents the buffer overflow.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"8537257874e949a59c834cecfd5a063e11b64b0b"},{"fixed":"72de0facc50afdb101fb7197d880407f1abfc77f"},{"fixed":"c4e582e686c4d683c87f2b4a316385b3d81d370f"},{"fixed":"cbc1de71766f326a44bb798aeae4a7ef4a081cc9"},{"fixed":"b26cccd87dcddc47b450a40f3b1ac3fe346efcff"},{"fixed":"e587af2c89ecc6382c518febea52fa9ba81e47c0"},{"fixed":"38c0abad45b190a30d8284a37264d2127a6ec303"}]}],"versions":["v5.12","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.100","v5.15.101","v5.15.102","v5.15.103","v5.15.104","v5.15.105","v5.15.106","v5.15.107","v5.15.108","v5.15.109","v5.15.11","v5.15.110","v5.15.111","v5.15.112","v5.15.113","v5.15.114","v5.15.115","v5.15.116","v5.15.117","v5.15.118","v5.15.119","v5.15.12","v5.15.120","v5.15.121","v5.15.122","v5.15.123","v5.15.124","v5.15.125","v5.15.126","v5.15.127","v5.15.128","v5.15.129","v5.15.13","v5.15.130","v5.15.131","v5.15.132","v5.15.133","v5.15.134","v5.15.135","v5.15.136","v5.15.137","v5.15.138","v5.15.139","v5.15.14","v5.15.140","v5.15.141","v5.15.142","v5.15.143","v5.15.144","v5.15.145","v5.15.146","v5.15.147","v5.15.148","v5.15.149","v5.15.15","v5.15.150","v5.15.151","v5.15.152","v5.15.153","v5.15.154","v5.15.155","v5.15.156","v5.15.157","v5.15.158","v5.15.159","v5.15.16","v5.15.160","v5.15.161","v5.15.162","v5.15.163","v5.15.164","v5.15.165","v5.15.166","v5.15.167","v5.15.168","v5.15.169","v5.15.17","v5.15.170","v5.15.171","v5.15.172","v5.15.173","v5.15.174","v5.15.175","v5.15.176","v5.15.177","v5.15.178","v5.15.179","v5.15.18","v5.15.180","v5.15.181","v5.15.182","v5.15.183","v5.15.184","v5.15.185","v5.15.186","v5.15.187","v5.15.188","v5.15.189","v5.15.19","v5.15.190","v5.15.191","v5.15.192","v5.15.193","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.89","v5.15.9","v5.15.90","v5.15.91","v5.15.92","v5.15.93","v5.15.94","v5.15.95","v5.15.96","v5.15.97","v5.15.98","v5.15.99","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","
