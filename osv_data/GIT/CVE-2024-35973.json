fix header validation in geneve[6]_xmit_skb","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngeneve: fix header validation in geneve[6]_xmit_skb\n\nsyzbot is able to trigger an uninit-value in geneve_xmit() [1]\n\nProblem : While most ip tunnel helpers (like ip_tunnel_get_dsfield())\nuses skb_protocol(skb, true), pskb_inet_may_pull() is only using\nskb->protocol.\n\nIf anything else than ETH_P_IPV6 or ETH_P_IP is found in skb->protocol,\npskb_inet_may_pull() does nothing at all.\n\nIf a vlan tag was provided by the caller (af_packet in the syzbot case),\nthe network header might not point to the correct location, and skb\nlinear part could be smaller than expected.\n\nAdd skb_vlan_inet_prepare() to perform a complete mac validation.\n\nUse this in geneve for the moment, I suspect we need to adopt this\nmore broadly.\n\nv4 - Jakub reported v3 broke l2_tos_ttl_inherit.sh selftest\n   - Only call __vlan_get_protocol() for vlan types.\n\nv2,v3 - Addressed Sabrina comments on v1 and v2\n\n[1]\n\nBUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in geneve_xmit_skb drivers/net/geneve.c:910 [inline]\n BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in
