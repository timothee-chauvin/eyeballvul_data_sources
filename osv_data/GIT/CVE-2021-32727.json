{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-32727","published":"2021-07-12T21:15:07Z","modified":"2025-10-30T06:00:21.474678Z","related":["GHSA-5v33-r9cm-7736"],"details":"Nextcloud Android Client is the Android client for Nextcloud. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.16.1, the Nextcloud Android client skipped a step that involved the client checking if a private key belonged to a previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance served a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. The vulnerability is patched in version 3.16.1. As a workaround, do not add additional end-to-end encrypted devices to a user account.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/android","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5b68a3a475acd0378f91f44dd5eedd79a454b952"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32727.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d78359d1bc46600d850b01b234dcd7c6e983ff43"}]}],"versions":["csync-0.50.0","e2e-tech-preview-1","v0.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-beta1","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-beta1","v1.3.0-beta2","v1.3.0-beta3","v1.3.0-beta4","v1.4.0","v1.4.0-beta1","v1.4.0-beta2","v1.4.0-rc1","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-beta1","v1.5.0-beta1-2nd","v1.5.0-beta2","v1.5.0-beta3","v1.5.1","v1.5.1-rc1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.3-rc1","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-beta1","v1.6.0-beta2","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.6.0-rc2","v1.6.0-rc3","v1.6.1","v1.6.1-rc1","v1.6.2","v1.6.2-rc1","v1.6.2-rc2","v1.6.2-themefix","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-alpha1","v1.7.0-beta1","v1.7.0-beta2","v1.7.0-beta3","v1.7.0-beta4","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.7.0beta1","v1.7.0beta2","v1.7.1-beta1","v1.7.1-rc1","v1.8.0","v1.8.0-beta1","v1.8.0-beta1a","v1.8.0-beta2","v1.8.0-rc1","v1.8.0rc1","v1.8.1","v1.8.1-beta1","v1.8.1-rc1","v1.8.1-rc2","v1.8.2","v1.8.2-beta1","v1.8.2-rc1","v1.8.3","v1.8.3-rc1","v1.8.3-rc2","v1.8.3-rc3","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-beta2","v2.0.0-rc2","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.2-oem","v2.0.2-rc1","v2.0.2-rc2","v2.5.0","v2.5.0-beta1","v2.5.0-beta2","v2.5.0-rc1","v2.5.0-rc2","v2.5.1","v2.5.2","v2.5.2-rc1","v2.5.3-rc1","v2.5.3-rc2","v2.7.0-beta1","v2.7.0-beta2","v2.7.0-beta3","v2.7.0-rc1","v3.1.0","v3.1.0-rc1","v3.1.0-rc2","v3.16.0","v3.16.0-rc1","v3.16.0-rc2","v3.16.0-rc3","v3.16.0-rc4","v3.2.0-rc1","v3.2.0-rc2","v3.2.0-rc3","v3.3.0","v3.3.0-rc1","v3.3.0-rc2","v3.4.0-do-not-use","v3.4.0-rc1","v3.4.0-rc2","v3.5.0","v3.5.0-rc1","v3.5.0-rc2","v3.5.0-rc3","v3.5.0-rc4","v3.6.0","v3.6.0-rc1","v3.6.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32727.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/android/pull/8438"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/end_to_end_encryption_rfc/blob/7f002996397faefb664019a97ebb0a1e210f64f0/RFC.md#further-devices"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-5v33-r9cm-7736"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1189162"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
