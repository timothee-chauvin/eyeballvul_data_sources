In Panindex prior to version 3.1.3,  a hard-coded JWT key `PanIndex` is used. An attacker can use the hard-coded JWT key to sign JWT token and perform any actions as a user with admin privileges. Version 3.1.3 has a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may change the JWT key in the source code before compiling the project.\n  \n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/px-org/panindex","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4fc7ce57255e36a140acec8929fe024066b27c27"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.4-BETA1","v2.0.4-BETA2","v2.0.4-BETA3","v2.0.4-BETA4","v2.0.5","v2.0.5-BETA1","v2.0.5-BETA2","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.0.9","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.0.8","v3.0.9","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-27583.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/27xxx/CVE-2023-27583.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/commit/f7ec0c5739af055ad3a825a20294a5c01ada3302"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/releases/tag/v3.1.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/security/advisories/GHSA-82wq-gmw8-g87v"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27583"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-321"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/27xxx/CVE-2023-27583.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
