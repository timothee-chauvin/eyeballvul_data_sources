{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-39916","published":"2024-07-12T15:00:10Z","modified":"2025-11-04T19:32:22Z","aliases":["GHSA-3xjr-xf9v-hwjh"],"summary":"NFS server misconfiguration allows file access outside the exported directory","details":"FOG is a free open-source cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system. There is a security issue with the NFS configuration in /etc/exports generated by the installer that allows an attacker to modify files outside the export in the default installation. The exports have the no_subtree_check option. The no_subtree_check option means that if a client performs a file operation, the server will only check if the requested file is on the correct filesystem, not if it is in the correct directory. This enables modifying files in /images, accessing other files on the same filesystem, and accessing files on other filesystems. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.10.30.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/fogproject/fogproject","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2de209bc57a177a052b4a877f000c591740b2f88"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-39916.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/commit/2de209bc57a177a052b4a877f000c591740b2f88"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/security/advisories/GHSA-3xjr-xf9v-hwjh"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-453"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
