In versions 6.0.0-Alpha5 and prior, Skipdata length is not bounds-checked, so a user-provided skipdata callback can make cs_disasm/cs_disasm_iter memcpy more than 24 bytes into cs_insn.bytes, causing a heap buffer overflow in the disassembly path. Commit cbef767ab33b82166d263895f24084b75b316df3 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"fad9f80564501f083adc92db3ef37f999af28dd0"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"6.0.0-Alpha5"}]}}],"versions":["1.0","2.0","2.0-rc1","2.1","2.1-rc1","2.1.1","2.1.2","3.0","3.0-rc1","3.0-rc2","3.0-rc3","3.0.1","3.0.1-rc1","3.0.1-rc2","3.0.2","4.0-alpha1","4.0-alpha2","6.0.0-Alpha1","6.0.0-Alpha3","6.0.0-Alpha4","6.0.0-Alpha5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67873.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67873.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone/commit/cbef767ab33b82166d263895f24084b75b316df3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone/security/advisories/GHSA-hj6g-v545-v7jg"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67873"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-122"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67873.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
