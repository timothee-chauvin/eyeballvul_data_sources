In versions 3.3.0 through 8.16.0, the Bulk User Import endpoint in applications built with the SDK does not validate the file-path wrapper or value. Without proper validation, affected applications may accept arbitrary file paths or URLs. The vulnerability affects any application that either directly uses the Auth0-PHP SDK (versions 3.3.0–8.16.0) or indirectly relies on those versions through the Auth0/symfony, Auth0/laravel-auth0, or Auth0/wordpress SDKs. This issue is fixed in version 8.17.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/auth0/auth0-php","events":[{"introduced":"fc08079ff28c91e37130e601a5cca50a16b7a663"},{"fixed":"1767d11b3dd7a5c622c034fd22649ed254a7683c"}]}],"versions":["3.3.0","3.3.1","3.3.2","3.3.3","3.3.4","3.3.5","3.3.6","3.3.7","3.4.0","3.4.1","3.4.2","3.4.3","4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.10","4.0.11","4.0.12","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.0.4","4.0.5","4.0.6","4.0.7","4.0.8","4.0.9","5.0.0","5.0.1","5.0.3","5.0.4","5.0.5","5.0.6","5.1.1","5.2.0","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.4.0","5.5.0","5.5.1","5.6.0","5.7.0","7.0.0","7.1.0","7.2.0","7.3.0","7.4.0","7.5.0","7.6.0","7.6.1","7.6.2","7.7.0","7.8.0","7.9.0","8.0.0","8.0.0-BETA1","8.0.0-BETA2","8.0.0-BETA3","8.0.1","8.0.2","8.0.3","8.0.4","8.0.5","8.0.6","8.1.0","8.10.0","8.11.0","8.11.1","8.12.0","8.13.0","8.14.0","8.15.0","8.16.0","8.2.0","8.2.1","8.3.0","8.3.1","8.3.2","8.3.3","8.3.4","8.3.5","8.3.6","8.3.7","8.3.8","8.4.0","8.5.0","8.6.0","8.7.0","8.7.1","8.8.0","8.9.0","8.9.1","8.9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58769.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/commit/9026da58f5c381cd4cb5932de829eff6eacbb65c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/releases/tag/8.17.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/security/advisories/GHSA-9mh6-g99m-ppcw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/security/advisories/GHSA-hjfh-5jmm-xr24"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/auth0/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-7jp2-5h22-m432"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/auth0/wordpress/security/advisories/GHSA-w22c-pw5m-482x"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-73"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
