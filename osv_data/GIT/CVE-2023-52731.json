This may lead to a\ncorruption of pages, hitting an Oops.\n\nThis patch makes sure to cancel the delayed work and clean up the\npageref list at closing the device for addressing the bug.  A part of\nthe cleanup code is factored out as a new helper function that is\ncalled from the common fb_release().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"186b89659c4c67cccead52961eab0ca3b23951dc"},{"fixed":"87b9802ca824fcee7915e717e9a60471af62e8e9"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"56c134f7f1b58be08bdb0ca8372474a4a5165f31"},{"fixed":"f1d91f0e9d5a240a809698d7d9c5a538e7dcc149"},{"fixed":"3efc61d95259956db25347e2a9562c3e54546e20"}]}],"versions":["v5.18","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-52731.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.19.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.13"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-52731.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3efc61d95259956db25347e2a9562c3e54546e20"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/87b9802ca824fcee7915e717e9a60471af62e8e9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f1d91f0e9d5a240a809698d7d9c5a538e7dcc149"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/52xxx/CVE-2023-52731.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52731"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/52xxx/CVE-2023-52731.json"}}
