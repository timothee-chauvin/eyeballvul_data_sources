{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-21880","published":"2025-03-27T14:57:09.581Z","modified":"2025-12-05T08:46:50.546798Z","summary":"drm/xe/userptr: fix EFAULT handling","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe/userptr: fix EFAULT handling\n\nCurrently we treat EFAULT from hmm_range_fault() as a non-fatal error\nwhen called from xe_vm_userptr_pin() with the idea that we want to avoid\nkilling the entire vm and chucking an error, under the assumption that\nthe user just did an unmap or something, and has no intention of\nactually touching that memory from the GPU.  At this point we have\nalready zapped the PTEs so any access should generate a page fault, and\nif the pin fails there also it will then become fatal.\n\nHowever it looks like it's possible for the userptr vma to still be on\nthe rebind list in preempt_rebind_work_func(), if we had to retry the\npin again due to something happening in the caller before we did the\nrebind step, but in the meantime needing to re-validate the userptr and\nthis time hitting the EFAULT.\n\nThis explains an internal user report of hitting:\n\n[  191.738349] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 157 at drivers/gpu/drm/xe/xe_res_cursor.h:158 xe_pt_stage_bind.constprop.0+0x60a/0x6b0 [xe]\n[  191.738551] Workqueue: xe-ordered-wq preempt_rebind_work_func [xe]\n[  191.738616] RIP: 0010:xe_pt_stage_bind.constprop.0+0x60a/0x6b0 [xe]\n[  191.738690] Call Trace:\n[  191.738692]  <TASK>\n[  191.738694]  ? show_regs+0x69/0x80\n[  191.738698]  ? __warn+0x93/0x1a0\n[  191.738703]  ? xe_pt_stage_bind.constprop.0+0x60a/0x6b0 [xe]\n[  191.738759]  ? report_bug+0x18f/0x1a0\n[  191.738764]  ? handle_bug+0x63/0xa0\n[  191.738767]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x19/0x70\n[  191.738770]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1b/0x20\n[  191.738777]  ? xe_pt_stage_bind.constprop.0+0x60a/0x6b0 [xe]\n[  191.738834]  ? ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n[  191.738849]  bind_op_prepare+0x105/0x7b0 [xe]\n[  191.738906]  ? dma_resv_reserve_fences+0x301/0x380\n[  191.738912]  xe_pt_update_ops_prepare+0x28c/0x4b0 [xe]\n[  191.738966]  ? kmemleak_alloc+0x4b/0x80\n[  191.738973]  ops_execute+0x188/0x9d0 [xe]\n[  191.739036]  xe_vm_rebind+0x4ce/0x5a0 [xe]\n[  191.739098]  ? trace_hardirqs_on+0x4d/0x60\n[  191.739112]  preempt_rebind_work_func+0x76f/0xd00 [xe]\n\nFollowed by NPD, when running some workload, since the sg was never\nactually populated but the vma is still marked for rebind when it should\nbe skipped for this special EFAULT case.
