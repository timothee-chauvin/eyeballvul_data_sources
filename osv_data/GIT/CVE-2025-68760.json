However, the corresponding\nshow handler, iommu_mmio_show(), uses readq() to perform an 8-byte\n(64-bit) read.\n\nIf a user provides an offset equal to `mmio_phys_end - 4`, the check\npasses, and will lead to a 4-byte out-of-bounds read.\n\nFix this by adjusting the boundary check to use sizeof(u64), which\ncorresponds to the size of the readq() operation.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"7a4ee419e8c144b747a8915856e91a034d7c8f34"},{"fixed":"b959df804c33913dbfdb90750f2d693502b3d126"},{"fixed":"0ec4aaf5f3f559716a6559f3d6d9616e9470bed6"},{"fixed":"a0c7005333f9a968abb058b1d77bbcd7fb7fd1e7"}]}],"versions":["v6.16","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.10","v6.17.11","v6.17.12","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68760.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.13"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68760.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0ec4aaf5f3f559716a6559f3d6d9616e9470bed6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a0c7005333f9a968abb058b1d77bbcd7fb7fd1e7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b959df804c33913dbfdb90750f2d693502b3d126"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68760.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68760"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68760.json"}}
