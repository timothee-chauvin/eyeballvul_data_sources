It\ncompiles, that's all I know.  I'll appreciate some review and testing from\nacrn folks.\n\nPatch #2+#3 improve follow_pte(), passing a VMA instead of the MM, adding\nmore sanity checks, and improving the documentation.  Gave it a quick test\non x86-64 using VM_PAT that ends up using follow_pte().\n\n\nThis patch (of 3):\n\nWe currently miss handling various cases, resulting in a dangerous\nfollow_pte() (previously follow_pfn()) usage.\n\n(1) We're not checking PTE write permissions.\n\nMaybe we should simply always require pte_write() like we do for\npin_user_pages_fast(FOLL_WRITE)? Hard to tell, so let's check for\nACRN_MEM_ACCESS_WRITE for now.\n\n(2) We're not rejecting refcounted pages.\n\nAs we are not using MMU notifiers, messing with refcounted pages is\ndangerous and can result in use-after-free. Let's make sure to reject them.\n\n(3) We are only looking at the first PTE of a bigger range.\n\nWe only lookup a single PTE, but memmap->len may span a larger area.\nLet's loop over all involved PTEs and make sure the PFN range is\nactually contiguous. Reject everything else: it couldn't have worked\neither way, and rather made use access PFNs we shouldn't be accessing.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"b9c43aa0b18da5619aac347d54cb67fe30d1f884"},{"fixed":"5c6705aa47b5b78d7ad36fea832bb69caa5bf49a"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"8a6e85f75a83d16a71077e41f2720c691f432002"},{"fixed":"afeb0e69627695f759fc73c39c1640dbf8649b32"},{"fixed":"e873f36ec890bece26ecce850e969917bceebbb6"},{"fixed":"4c4ba3cf3a15ccfbaf787d0296fa42cdb00da9b4"},{"fixed":"2c8d6e24930b8ef7d4a81787627c559ae0e0d3bb"},{"fixed":"3d6586008f7b638f91f3332602592caa8b00b559"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"149d5fb7e0124c3763e92edd1fde19417f4d2d09"},{"last_affected":"02098ac42b7ff055ec72cd083ee1eb0a23481a19"}]}],"versions":["v2.6.12","v2.6.12-rc2","v2.6.12-rc3","v2.6.12-rc4","v2.6.12-rc5","v2.6.12-rc6","v2.6.13","v2.6.13-rc1","v2.6.13-rc2","v2.6.13-rc3","v2.6.13-rc4","v2.6.13-rc5","v2.6.13-rc6","v2.6.13-rc7","v2.6.14","v2.6.14-rc1","v2.6.14-rc2","v2.6.14-rc3","v2.6.14-rc4","v2.6.14-rc5","v2.6.15","v2.6.15-rc1","v2.6.15-rc2","v2.6.15-rc3","v2.6.15-rc4","v2.6.15-rc5","v2.6.15-rc6","v2.6.15-rc7","v2.6.16","v2.6.16-rc1","v2.6.16-rc2","v2.6.16-rc3","v2.6.16-rc4","v2.6.16-rc5","v2.6.16-rc6","v2.6.17","v2.6.17-rc1","v2.6.17-rc2","v2.6.17-rc3","v2.6.17-rc4","v2.6.17-rc5","v2.6.17-rc6","v2.6.18","v2.6.18-rc1","v2.6.18-rc2","v2.6.18-rc3","v2.6.18-rc4","v2.6.18-rc5","v2.6.18-rc6","v2.6.18-rc7","v2.6.19","v2.6.19-rc1","v2.6.19-rc2","v2.6.19-rc3","v2.6.19-rc4","v2.6.19-rc5","v2.6.19-rc6","v2.6.20","v2.6.20-rc1","v2.6.20-rc2","v2.6.20-rc3","v2.6.20-rc4","v2.6.20-rc5","v2.6.20-rc6","v2.6.20-rc7","v2.6.21","v2.6.21-rc1","v2.6.21-rc2","v2.6.21-rc3","v2.6.21-rc4","v2.6.21-rc5","v2.6.21-rc6","v2.6.21-rc7","v2.6.22","v2.6.22-rc1","v2.6.22-rc2","v2.6.22-rc3","v2.6.22-rc4","v2.6.22-rc5","v2.6.22-rc6","v2.6.22-rc7","v2.6.23","v2.6.23-rc1","v2.6.23-rc2","v2.6.23-rc3","v2.6.23-rc4","v2.6.23-rc5","v2.6.23-rc6","v2.6.23-rc7","v2.6.23-rc8","v2.6.23-rc9","v2.6.24","v2.6.24-rc1","v2.6.24-rc2","v2.6.24-rc3","v2.6.24-rc4","v2.6.24-rc5","v2.6.24-rc6","v2.6.24-rc7","v2.6.24-rc8","v2.6.25","v2.6.25-rc1","v2.6.25-rc2","v2.6.25-rc3","v2.6.25-rc4","v2.6.25-rc5","v2.6.25-rc6","v2.6.25-rc7","v2.6.25-rc8","v2.6.25-rc9","v2.6.26","v2.6.26-rc1","v2.6.26-rc2","v2.6.26-rc3","v2.6.26-rc4","v2.6.26-rc5","v2.6.26-rc6","v2.6.26-rc7","v2.6.26-rc8","v2.6.26-rc9","v2.6.27","v2.6.27-rc1","v2.6.27-rc2","v2.6.27-rc3","v2.6.27-rc4","v2.6.27-rc5","v2.6.27-rc6","v2.6.27-rc7","v2.6.27-rc8","v2.6.27-rc9","v2.6.28","v2.6.28-rc1","v2.6.28-rc2","v2.6.28-rc3","v2.6.28-rc4","v2.6.28-rc5","v2.6.28-rc6","v2.6.28-rc7","v2.6.28-rc8","v2.6.28-rc9","v2.6.29","v2.6.29-rc1","v2.6.29-rc2","v2.6.29-rc3","v2.6.29-rc4","v2.6.29-rc5","v2.6.29-rc6","v2.6.29-rc7","v2.6.29-rc8","v2.6.30","v2.6.30-rc1","v2.6.30-rc2","v2.6.30-rc3","v2.6.30-rc4","v2.6.30-rc5","v2.6.30-rc6","v2.6.30-rc7","v2.6.30-rc8","v2.6.31","v2.6.31-rc1","v2.6.31-rc2","v2.6.31-rc3","v2.6.31-rc4","v2.6.31-rc5","v2.6.31-rc6","v2.6.31-rc7","v2.6.31-rc8","v2.6.31-rc9","v2.6.32","v2.6.32-rc1","v2.6.32-rc2","v2.6.32-rc3","v2.6.32-rc4","v2.6.32-rc5","v2.6.32-rc6","v2.6.32-rc7","v2.6.32-rc8","v2.6.33","v2.6.33-rc1","v2.6.33-rc2","v2.6.33-rc3","v2.6.33-rc4","v2.6.33-rc5","v2.6.33-rc6","v2.6.33-rc7","v2.6.33-rc8","v2.6.34","v2.6.34-rc1","v2.6.34-rc2","v2.6.34-rc3","v2.6.34-rc4","v2.6.34-rc5","v2.6.34-rc6","v2.6.34-rc7","v2.6.35","v2.6.35-rc1","v2.6.35-rc2","v2.6.35-rc3","v2.6.35-rc4","v2.6.35-rc5","v2.6.35-rc6","v2.6.36","v2.6.36-rc1","v2.6.36-rc2","v2.6.36-rc3","v2.6.36-rc4","v2.6.36-rc5","v2.6.36-rc6","v2.6.36-rc7","v2.6.36-rc8","v2.6.37","v2.6.37-rc1","v2.6.37-rc2","v2.6.37-rc3","v2.6.37-rc4","v2.6.37-rc5","v2.6.37-rc6","v2.6.37-rc7","v2.6.37-rc8","v2.6.38","v2.6.38-rc1","v2.6.38-rc2","v2.6.38-rc3","v2.6.38-rc4","v2.6.38-rc5","v2.6.38-rc6","v2.6.38-rc7","v2.6.38-rc8","v2.6.39","v2.6.39-rc1","v2.6.39-rc2","v2.6.39-rc3","v2.6.39-rc4","v2.6.39-rc5","v2.6.39-rc6","v2.6.39-rc7","v3.0","v3.0-rc1","v3.0-rc2","v3.0-rc3","v3.0-rc4","v3.0-rc5","v3.0-rc6","v3.0-rc7","v3.1","v3.1-rc1","v3.1-rc10","v3.1-rc2","v3.1-rc3","v3.1-rc4","v3.1-rc5","v3.1-rc6","v3.1-rc7","v3.1-rc8","v3.1-rc9","v3.10","v3.10-rc1","v3.10-rc2","v3.10-rc3","v3.10-rc4","v3.10-rc5","v3.10-rc6","v3.10-rc7","v3.11","v3.11-rc1","v3.11-rc2","v3.11-rc3","v3.11-rc4","v3.11-rc5","v3.11-rc6","v3.11-rc7","v3.12","v3.12-rc1","v3.12-rc2","v3.12-rc3","v3.12-rc4","v3.12-rc5","v3.12-rc6","v3.12-rc7","v3.13","v3.13-rc1","v3.13-rc2","v3.13-rc3","v3.13-rc4","v3.13-rc5","v3.13-rc6","v3.13-rc7","v3.13-rc8","v3.14","v3.14-rc1","v3.14-rc2","v3.14-rc3","v3.14-rc4","v3.14-rc5","v3.14-rc6","v3.14-rc7","v3.14-rc8","v3.15","v3.15-rc1","v3.15-rc2","v3.15-rc3","v3.15-rc4","v3.15-rc5","v3.15-rc6","v3.15-rc7","v3.15-rc8","v3.16","v3.16-rc1","v3.16-rc2","v3.16-rc3","v3.16-rc4","v3.16-rc5","v3.16-rc6","v3.16-rc7","v3
