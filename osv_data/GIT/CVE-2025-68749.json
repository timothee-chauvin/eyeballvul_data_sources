Then file_priv_unbind() triggers a warning in\ndrm_mm_takedown() during context teardown.\n\nProtect the unmapping sequence with bo_list_lock to ensure the BO is\nalways fully unmapped when removed from the list. This ensures the BO\nis either fully unmapped at context teardown time or present on the\nlist and unmapped by file_priv_unbind().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"48aea7f2a2efae6a1bd201061c71a81b3f3b7e55"},{"fixed":"fb16493ebd8f171bcf0772262619618a131f30f7"},{"fixed":"d71333ffdd3707d84cfb95acfaf8ba892adc066b"},{"fixed":"00812636df370bedf4e44a0c81b86ea96bca8628"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.10","v6.17.11","v6.17.12","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.6","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68749.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.13"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68749.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/00812636df370bedf4e44a0c81b86ea96bca8628"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d71333ffdd3707d84cfb95acfaf8ba892adc066b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fb16493ebd8f171bcf0772262619618a131f30f7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68749.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68749"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68749.json"}}
