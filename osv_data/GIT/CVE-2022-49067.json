That can cause bugs with hardened usercopy\nas described below by Kefeng Wang:\n\n  When running ethtool eth0 on 64-bit Book3E, a BUG occurred:\n\n    usercopy: Kernel memory exposure attempt detected from SLUB object not in SLUB page?! (offset 0, size 1048)!\n    kernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:99\n    ...\n    usercopy_abort+0x64/0xa0 (unreliable)\n    __check_heap_object+0x168/0x190\n    __check_object_size+0x1a0/0x200\n    dev_ethtool+0x2494/0x2b20\n    dev_ioctl+0x5d0/0x770\n    sock_do_ioctl+0xf0/0x1d0\n    sock_ioctl+0x3ec/0x5a0\n    __se_sys_ioctl+0xf0/0x160\n    system_call_exception+0xfc/0x1f0\n    system_call_common+0xf8/0x200\n\n  The code shows below,\n\n    data = vzalloc(array_size(gstrings.len, ETH_GSTRING_LEN));\n    copy_to_user(useraddr, data, gstrings.len * ETH_GSTRING_LEN))\n\n  The data is alloced by vmalloc(), virt_addr_valid(ptr) will return true\n  on 64-bit Book3E, which leads to the panic.\n\n  As commit 4dd7554a6456 (\"powerpc/64: Add VIRTUAL_BUG_ON checks for __va\n  and __pa addresses\") does, make sure the virt addr above PAGE_OFFSET in\n  the virt_addr_valid() for 64-bit, also add upper limit check to make\n  sure the virt is below high_memory.\n\n  Meanwhile, for 32-bit PAGE_OFFSET is the virtual address of the start\n  of lowmem, high_memory is the upper low virtual address, the check is\n  suitable for 32-bit, this will fix the issue mentioned in commit\n  602946ec2f90 (\"powerpc: Set max_mapnr correctly\") too.\n\nOn 32-bit there is a similar problem with high memory, that was fixed in\ncommit 602946ec2f90 (\"powerpc: Set max_mapnr correctly\"), but that\ncommit breaks highmem and needs to be reverted.\n\nWe can't easily fix __pa(), we have code that relies on its current\nbehaviour. So for now add extra checks to virt_addr_valid().\n\nFor 64-bit Book3S the extra checks are not necessary, the combination of\nvirt_to_pfn() and pfn_valid() should yield the correct result, but they\nare harmless.\n\n[mpe: Add additional change log
