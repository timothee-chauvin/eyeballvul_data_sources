Prior to 3.8.5, ClipShare Server for Windows uses the default Windows DLL search order and loads system libraries like CRYPTBASE.dll and WindowsCodecs.dll from its own directory before the system path. A local, non-privileged user who can write to the folder containing clip_share.exe can place malicious DLLs there, leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the server, and, if launched by an Administrator (or another elevated user), it results in a reliable local privilege escalation. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.8.5.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/thevindu-w/clip_share_server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"04191058d5e769ecf2979531811e41745732edda"}]}],"versions":["v1.0","v2.0","v2.1","v2.2","v2.3","v2.4","v2.5","v2.5.1","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0","v3.0.0","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.4.0","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.6.0","v3.7.0","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.8.2","v3.8.3","v3.8.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-49148.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["200711091863444710263809425127183006646","335400326475178537662265789418024315391","255829493109095807253039535406465413637","125339555279777019517190265643903096412","26712830335828881412686801110980781460","256717724035522438274532091970655857404"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2025-49148-24a979d7","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/thevindu-w/clip_share_server/commit/04191058d5e769ecf2979531811e41745732edda","target":{"file":"src/utils/utils.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"144876014374404385599275385673227312203","length":562},"id":"CVE-2025-49148-46e3ded8","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/thevindu-w/clip_share_server/commit/04191058d5e769ecf2979531811e41745732edda","target":{"file":"src/utils/utils.c","function":"cleanup"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/thevindu-w/clip_share_server/security/advisories/GHSA-rc47-h83g-2r8j"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-427"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
