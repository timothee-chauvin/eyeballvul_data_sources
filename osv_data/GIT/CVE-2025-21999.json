instantiation.\n\nThe bug is that pde->proc_ops don't belong to /proc, it belongs to a\nmodule, therefore dereferencing it after /proc entry has been registered\nis a bug unless use_pde/unuse_pde() pair has been used.\n\nuse_pde/unuse_pde can be avoided (2 atomic ops!) because pde->proc_ops\nnever changes so information necessary for inode instantiation can be\nsaved _before_ proc_register() in PDE itself and used later, avoiding\npde->proc_ops->...  dereference.\n\n      rmmod                         lookup\nsys_delete_module\n                         proc_lookup_de\n\t\t\t
