There is a tiny chance of the following race:\n\n'hci_cmd_sync_work()'\n\n 'update_passive_scan_sync()'\n\n   'hci_update_passive_scan_sync()'\n\n     'hci_discovery_filter_clear()'\n       kfree(uuids);\n\n       <-------------------------preempted-------------------------------->\n                                           'start_service_discovery()'\n\n                                             'hci_discovery_filter_clear()'\n                                               kfree(uuids); // DOUBLE FREE\n\n       <-------------------------preempted-------------------------------->\n\n      uuids = NULL;\n\nTo fix it let's add locking around 'kfree()' call and NULL pointer\nassignment.
