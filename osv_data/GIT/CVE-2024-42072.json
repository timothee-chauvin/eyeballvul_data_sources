When offset is negative\nit should be patched differently.\nThe 2nd bug is in the verifier:\nwhen current state may_goto_depth is equal to visited state may_goto_depth\nit means there is an actual infinite loop. It's not correct to prune\nexploration of the program at this point.\nNote, that this check doesn't limit the program to only one may_goto insn,\nsince 2nd and any further may_goto will increment may_goto_depth only\nin the queued state pushed for future exploration. The current state\nwill have may_goto_depth == 0 regardless of number of may_goto insns\nand the verifier has to explore the program until bpf_exit.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"011832b97b311bb9e3c27945bc0d1089a14209c9"},{"fixed":"175827e04f4be53f3dfb57edf12d0d49b18fd939"},{"fixed":"2b2efe1937ca9f8815884bd4dcd5b32733025103"}]}],"versions":["v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.8","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7","v6.9.1","v6.9.2","v6.9.3","v6.9.4","v6.9.5","v6.9.6","v6.9.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-42072.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.9.0"},{"fixed":"6.9.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-42072.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/175827e04f4be53f3dfb57edf12d0d49b18fd939"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2b2efe1937ca9f8815884bd4dcd5b32733025103"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/42xxx/CVE-2024-42072.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42072"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/42xxx/CVE-2024-42072.json"}}
