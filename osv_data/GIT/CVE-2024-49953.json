When\nxfrm_state_check_expire() is called, the state can be reset to\nXFRM_STATE_EXPIRED, even if it is XFRM_STATE_DEAD already. This\nhappens when xfrm state is deleted, but not freed yet. As\n__xfrm_state_delete() is called again in xfrm timer, the following\ncrash occurs.\n\nTo fix this issue, skip xfrm_state_check_expire() if km.state is not\nXFRM_STATE_VALID.\n\n Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000108: 0000 [#1] SMP\n CPU: 5 UID: 0 PID: 7448 Comm: kworker/u102:2 Not tainted 6.11.0-rc2+ #1\n Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n Workqueue: mlx5e_ipsec: eth%d mlx5e_ipsec_handle_sw_limits [mlx5_core]\n RIP: 0010:__xfrm_state_delete+0x3d/0x1b0\n Code: 0f 84 8b 01 00 00 48 89 fd c6 87 c8 00 00 00 05 48 8d bb 40 10 00 00 e8 11 04 1a 00 48 8b 95 b8 00 00 00 48 8b 85 c0 00 00 00 <48> 89 42 08 48 89 10 48 8b 55 10 48 b8 00 01 00 00 00 00 ad de 48\n RSP: 0018:ffff88885f945ec8 EFLAGS: 00010246\n RAX: dead000000000122 RBX: ffffffff82afa940 RCX: 0000000000000036\n RDX: dead000000000100 RSI: 0000000000000000 RDI: ffffffff82afb980\n RBP: ffff888109a20340 R08: ffff88885f945ea0 R09: 0000000000000000\n R10: 0000000000000000 R11: ffff88885f945ff8 R12: 0000000000000246\n R13: ffff888109a20340 R14: ffff88885f95f420 R15: ffff88885f95f400\n FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88885f940000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n CR2: 00007f2163102430 CR3: 00000001128d6001 CR4: 0000000000370eb0\n DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n Call Trace:\n  <IRQ>\n  ?
