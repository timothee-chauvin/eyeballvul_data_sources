The bulk of\nvCPU creation runs _outside_ of kvm->lock to allow creating multiple vCPUs\nin parallel, and so sev_info.es_active can get toggled from false=>true in\nthe destination VM after (or during) svm_vcpu_create(), resulting in an\nSEV{-ES} VM effectively having a non-SEV{-ES} vCPU.\n\nThe issue manifests most visibly as a crash when trying to free a vCPU's\nNULL VMSA page in an SEV-ES VM, but any number of things can go wrong.\n\n  BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffebde00000000\n  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n  PGD 0 P4D 0\n  Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN NOPTI\n  CPU: 227 UID: 0 PID: 64063 Comm: syz.5.60023 Tainted: G     U     O        6.15.0-smp-DEV #2 NONE\n  Tainted: [U]=USER, [O]=OOT_MODULE\n  Hardware name: Google, Inc.
