{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-8769","published":"2025-03-20T10:15:44Z","modified":"2025-10-22T07:51:57.686935Z","aliases":["GHSA-4qcx-jx49-6qrh"],"details":"A vulnerability in the `LockManager.release_locks` function in aimhubio/aim (commit bb76afe) allows for arbitrary file deletion through relative path traversal. The `run_hash` parameter, which is user-controllable, is concatenated without normalization as part of a path used to specify file deletion. This vulnerability is exposed through the `Repo._close_run()` method, which is accessible via the tracking server instruction API. As a result, an attacker can exploit this to delete any arbitrary file on the machine running the tracking server.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/aimhubio/aim","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bb76afe6e9a54364f322520cc4fea2679238f904"}]}],"versions":["pre-launch","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.8","v1.0.0","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.7rc1","v2.1.6","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-beta5","v3.0.0-beta6","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.10.0","v3.10.1","v3.10.2","v3.10.3","v3.11.0","v3.11.1","v3.11.2","v3.12.0","v3.12.1","v3.12.2","v3.13.0","v3.13.1","v3.13.2","v3.13.3","v3.13.4","v3.14.0","v3.14.1","v3.14.2","v3.14.3","v3.14.4","v3.15.0","v3.15.1","v3.15.2","v3.16.0","v3.16.1","v3.16.2","v3.17.0","v3.17.1","v3.17.2","v3.17.3","v3.17.4","v3.17.5","v3.18.1","v3.19.0","v3.19.1","v3.19.2","v3.19.3","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.20.1","v3.21.0","v3.22.0","v3.23.0","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.3.4","v3.3.5","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.5.3","v3.5.4","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.6.2","v3.6.3","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.7.2","v3.7.3","v3.7.4","v3.7.5","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v3.9.2","v3.9.3","v3.9.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-8769.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/59d3472f-f581-4beb-a090-afd36a00ecf7"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
