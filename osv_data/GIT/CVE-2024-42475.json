These can be successfully guessed by an attacker allowing them to perform a CSRF vs a user, associating the user's session with the attacker's protected resources. While `state` isn't exactly a cryptographic value, it should be generated in a cryptographically secure way. `generateState` should be using a CSPRNG. Version 0.11 modifies the `generateState` function to generate `state` values of at least 128 bits of entropy while using a CSPRNG.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cordea/oauth","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ec2e058fc46f04deaf3cb55eca32b3b83c614953"}]}],"versions":["v0.10","v0.2","v0.3","v0.4","v0.4.1","v0.5","v0.6","v0.7","v0.8","v0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-42475.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CORDEA/oauth/security/advisories/GHSA-332c-q46h-fg8f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/CORDEA/oauth/blob/b8c163b0d9cfad6d29ce8c1fb394e5f47182ee1c/src/oauth2.nim#L179"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-330","CWE-352"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
