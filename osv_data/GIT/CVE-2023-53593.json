{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53593","published":"2025-10-04T15:44:06.853Z","modified":"2026-01-05T21:00:20.854702Z","related":["SUSE-SU-2025:4057-1","SUSE-SU-2025:4128-1","SUSE-SU-2025:4132-1","SUSE-SU-2025:4301-1"],"summary":"cifs: Release folio lock on fscache read hit.","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncifs: Release folio lock on fscache read hit.\n\nUnder the current code, when cifs_readpage_worker is called, the call\ncontract is that the callee should unlock the page. This is documented\nin the read_folio section of Documentation/filesystems/vfs.rst as:\n\n> The filesystem should unlock the folio once the read has completed,\n> whether it was successful or not.\n\nWithout this change, when fscache is in use and cache hit occurs during\na read, the page lock is leaked, producing the following stack on\nsubsequent reads (via mmap) to the page:\n\n$ cat /proc/3890/task/12864/stack\n[<0>] folio_wait_bit_common+0x124/0x350\n[<0>] filemap_read_folio+0xad/0xf0\n[<0>] filemap_fault+0x8b1/0xab0\n[<0>] __do_fault+0x39/0x150\n[<0>] do_fault+0x25c/0x3e0\n[<0>] __handle_mm_fault+0x6ca/0xc70\n[<0>] handle_mm_fault+0xe9/0x350\n[<0>] do_user_addr_fault+0x225/0x6c0\n[<0>] exc_page_fault+0x84/0x1b0\n[<0>] asm_exc_page_fault+0x27/0x30\n\nThis requires a reboot to resolve; it is a deadlock.\n\nNote however that the call to cifs_readpage_from_fscache does mark the\npage clean, but does not free the folio lock. This happens in\n__cifs_readpage_from_fscache on success. Releasing the lock at that\npoint however is not appropriate as cifs_readahead also calls\ncifs_readpage_from_fscache and *does* unconditionally release the lock\nafter its return. This change therefore effectively makes\ncifs_readpage_worker work like cifs_readahead.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0174ee9947bd0f24fee2794b35258960d108b7aa"},{"fixed":"9e725386d4262ef23ae51993f04602bc535b5be2"},{"fixed":"7a9fb689c1a1dc373887621a3bfa3810df0abde4"},{"fixed":"69513dd669e243928f7450893190915a88f84a2b"}]}],"versions":["v5.17","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.4.1","v6.4.10","v6.4.11","v6.4.2","v6.4.3","v6.4.4","v6.4.5","v6.4.6","v6.4.7","v6.4.8","v6.4.9","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53593.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.47"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.12"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53593.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/69513dd669e243928f7450893190915a88f84a2b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7a9fb689c1a1dc373887621a3bfa3810df0abde4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9e725386d4262ef23ae51993f04602bc535b5be2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53593.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53593"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53593.json"}}
