Users of JupyterHub deployments running DockerSpawner starting with 0.11.0 without specifying `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` configuration allow users to launch _any_ pullable docker image, instead of restricting to only the single configured image, as intended. This issue has been addressed in commit `3ba4b665b` which has been included in dockerspawner release version 13. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should explicitly set `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` to a non-empty list containing only the default image will result in the intended default behavior.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner","events":[{"introduced":"4b9b86deae2bcf44fb4fc0feb535997a4f0025fa"},{"fixed":"e54ecf4f36e9275ec1afb8993cd9736369c1b0da"}]}],"versions":["0.11.0","0.11.1","12.0.0","12.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-48311.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/48xxx/CVE-2023-48311.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/commit/3ba4b665b6ca6027ea7a032d7ca3eab977574626"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/security/advisories/GHSA-hfgr-h3vc-p6c2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48311"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-20"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/48xxx/CVE-2023-48311.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
