This could lead to an attacker injecting false log entries or corrupt the log file format. This has been fixed in the CKAN versions 2.9.11 and 2.10.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should override the `/user/reset` endpoint to filter the `id` parameter in order to exclude newlines.\n\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ckan/ckan","events":[{"introduced":"aec8130bc07ffafd191c4192cca9de735c430dd1"},{"fixed":"f2d47c8f87bc5f224ebff93b23d0f6fda8fb81b4"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.0"},{"fixed":"2.9.11"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ckan/ckan","events":[{"introduced":"70bec6611003b96ec7a02abb9605afdfb0964ad9"},{"fixed":"f03e7f7d02397b064a29a5c737fa4a72b8a30191"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.10.0"},{"fixed":"2.10.4"}]}}],"versions":["ckan-2.10.0","ckan-2.10.1","ckan-2.10.2","ckan-2.10.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-27097.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ckan/ckan/commit/81b56c55e5e3651d7fcf9642cd5a489a9b62212c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ckan/ckan/security/advisories/GHSA-8g38-3m6v-232j"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-532"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
