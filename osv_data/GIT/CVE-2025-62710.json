  "details": "Sakai is a Collaboration and Learning Environment. Prior to versions 23.5 and 25.0, EncryptionUtilityServiceImpl initialized an AES256TextEncryptor password (serverSecretKey) using RandomStringUtils with the default java.util.Random. java.util.Random is a non\u2011cryptographic PRNG and can be predicted from limited state/seed information (e.g., start time window), substantially reducing the effective search space of the generated key. An attacker who can obtain ciphertexts (e.g., exported or at\u2011rest strings protected by this service) and approximate the PRNG seed can feasibly reconstruct the serverSecretKey and decrypt affected data. SAK-49866 is patched in Sakai 23.5, 25.0, and trunk.",
