Prior to versions 8.5.16 and 9.2.8, malicious user can create a snapshot and arbitrarily choose the `originalUrl` parameter by editing the query, thanks to a web proxy. When another user opens the URL of the snapshot, they will be presented with the regular web interface delivered by the trusted Grafana server. The `Open original dashboard` button no longer points to the to the real original dashboard but to the attacker’s injected URL. This issue is fixed in versions 8.5.16 and 9.2.8.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"05bf2419528631e6dedfd34bf853f48b4bb3a552"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.5.16"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana","events":[{"introduced":"b5c56f63710e09f37b8557ddd8b99ae3fc583169"},{"fixed":"796e2e020c2f818b8bdc7c2b2e548a15ce3d16cc"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"9.0.0"},{"fixed":"9.2.8"}]}}],"versions":["v1.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.8.0","v1.8.0-rc1","v1.8.1","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-rc1","v1.9.1","v2.0.0-beta1","v2.0.0-beta3","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.6.0-beta1","v3.0-beta1","v3.0-beta2","v3.0-beta3","v3.0-beta4","v3.0-beta5","v3.0.0-beta6","v3.0.0-beta7","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.1.0","v3.1.0-beta1","v3.1.1","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-beta1","v4.0.0-beta2","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.1.0-beta1","v4.2.0-beta1","v4.3.0","v4.3.0-beta1","v4.3.1","v4.3.2","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.4.2","v4.4.3","v4.5.0","v4.5.0-beta1","v4.5.1","v4.6.0-beta1","v5.,2.4","v5.0.0","v5.0.0-beta1","v5.0.0-beta2","v5.0.0-beta3","v5.0.0-beta4","v5.0.0-beta5","v6.0.0-beta1","v6.5","v8.3.3","v8.4.0-beta1","v9.3.0-beta1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39324.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/39xxx/CVE-2022-39324.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/commit/239888f22983010576bb3a9135a7294e88c0c74a"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/commit/d7dcea71ea763780dc286792a0afd560bff2985c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/60232"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/60256"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-4724-7jwc-3fpw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39324"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230309-0010/"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/39xxx/CVE-2022-39324.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
