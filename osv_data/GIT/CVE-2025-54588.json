{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-54588","published":"2025-09-02T23:39:07.429Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:20:16.492969Z","aliases":["BIT-envoy-2025-54588","GHSA-g9vw-6pvx-7gmw"],"summary":"Envoy: Race condition in Dynamic Forward Proxy leads to use-after-free and segmentation faults","details":"Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. Versions 1.34.0 through 1.34.4 and 1.35.0 contain a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in the DNS cache, causing abnormal process termination. The vulnerability is in Envoy's Dynamic Forward Proxy implementation, occurring when a completion callback for a DNS resolution triggers new DNS resolutions or removes existing pending resolutions. This condition may occur when the following conditions are met: dynamic Forwarding Filter is enabled, the `envoy.reloadable_features.dfp_cluster_resolves_hosts` runtime flag is enabled, and the Host header is modified between the Dynamic Forwarding Filter and Router filters. This issue is resolved in versions 1.34.5 and 1.35.1. To work around this issue, set the envoy.reloadable_features.dfp_cluster_resolves_hosts runtime flag to false.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"d7809ba2b07fd869d49bfb122b27f6a7977b4d94"},{"fixed":"7e251c0145bb32a1ca7d7199ac0727765538d942"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.34.0"},{"fixed":"1.34.5"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"84305a6cb64bd55aaf606bdd53de7cd6080427a1"},{"fixed":"6e9539d0366baf85baf9acb3e618cb3384765f13"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.35.0"},{"fixed":"1.35.1"}]}}],"versions":["v1.34.0","v1.34.1","v1.34.2","v1.34.3","v1.34.4","v1.35.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54588.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54588.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases/tag/v1.34.5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases/tag/v1.35.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-g9vw-6pvx-7gmw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54588"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-416"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54588.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
