The logic is\napplicable to architectures where the CLOSID effectively forms part of the\nmonitoring identifier and so do not allow complete freedom to choose an unused\nmonitoring identifier for a given CLOSID.\n\nThis support missed that some platforms may not have these counters.  This\ncauses a NULL pointer dereference when creating a new control group as the\narray was not allocated by dom_data_init().\n\nAs this feature isn't necessary on platforms that don't have cache occupancy\nmonitors, add this to the check that occurs when a new control group is\nallocated.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"6eac36bb9eb0349c983313c71692c19d50b56878"},{"fixed":"a8a1bcc27d4607227088d80483164289b5348293"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"6eac36bb9eb0349c983313c71692c19d50b56878"},{"fixed":"ed5addb55e403ad6598102bcf546e068ae01fef6"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"6eac36bb9eb0349c983313c71692c19d50b56878"},{"fixed":"93a418fc61da13d1ee4047d4d1327990f7a2816a"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"6eac36bb9eb0349c983313c71692c19d50b56878"},{"fixed":"a121798ae669351ec0697c94f71c3a692b2a755b"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.13.1","v6.13.10","v6.13.2","v6.13.3","v6.13.4","v6.13.5","v6.13.6","v6.13.7","v6.13.8","v6.13.9","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.14.1","v6.8","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38049.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.9.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.23"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.13.11"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.14.0"},{"fixed":"6.14.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38049.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/93a418fc61da13d1ee4047d4d1327990f7a2816a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a121798ae669351ec0697c94f71c3a692b2a755b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a8a1bcc27d4607227088d80483164289b5348293"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ed5addb55e403ad6598102bcf546e068ae01fef6"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
