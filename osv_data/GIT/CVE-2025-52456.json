{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-52456","published":"2025-08-25T15:15:40.410Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:37:46.532178Z","details":"A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the WebP Image Decoding functionality of the SAIL Image Decoding Library v0.9.8. When loading a specially crafted .webp animation an integer overflow can be made to occur when calculating the stride for decoding. Afterwards, this will cause a heap-based buffer to overflow when decoding the image which can lead to remote code execution. An attacker will need to convince the library to read a file to trigger this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/happyseafox/sail","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"e73922273e04ef37ac50b0118960b756548a2d06"}]}],"versions":["v0.9.0","v0.9.0-pre1","v0.9.0-pre10","v0.9.0-pre11","v0.9.0-pre12","v0.9.0-pre13","v0.9.0-pre14","v0.9.0-pre15","v0.9.0-pre16","v0.9.0-pre17","v0.9.0-pre18","v0.9.0-pre19","v0.9.0-pre2","v0.9.0-pre20","v0.9.0-pre21","v0.9.0-pre22","v0.9.0-pre23","v0.9.0-pre3","v0.9.0-pre4","v0.9.0-pre5","v0.9.0-pre6","v0.9.0-pre7","v0.9.0-pre8","v0.9.0-pre9","v0.9.0-rc1","v0.9.0-rc2","v0.9.0-rc3","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.5","v0.9.6","v0.9.7","v0.9.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52456.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2025-2224"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2025-2224"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
