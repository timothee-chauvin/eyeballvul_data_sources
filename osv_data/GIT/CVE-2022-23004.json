This may be leveraged by an attacker to cause an error scenario, resulting in a limited denial of service for an individual user. The scope of impact cannot extend to other components.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/sweet-b","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"fc62093717722ba9817d331d830b95001542308a"}]}],"versions":["audit-tob-2020-01","v1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23004.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.westerndigital.com/support/product-security/wdc-22013-sweet-b-incorrect-output-vulnerabilities"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
