{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-66029","published":"2025-12-17T22:32:51.982Z","modified":"2025-12-18T21:46:02.696064Z","aliases":["GHSA-2cwp-8g29-9q32"],"summary":"Open OnDemand affected by Apache proxy passing sensitive headers","details":"Open OnDemand provides remote web access to supercomputers. In versions 4.0.8 and prior, the Apache proxy allows sensitive headers to be passed to origin servers. This means malicious users can create an origin server on a compute node that record these headers when unsuspecting users connect to it. Maintainers anticipate a patch in a 4.1 release. Workarounds exist for 4.0.x versions. Using `custom_location_directives` in `ood_portal.yml` in version 4.0.x (not available for versions below 4.0) centers can unset and or edit these headers. Note that `OIDCPassClaimsAs both` is the default and centers can set `OIDCPassClaimsAs ` to `none` or `environment` to stop passing these headers to the client. Centers that have an OIDC provider with the `OIDCPassClaimsAs` with `none` or `environment` settings can adjust the settings using guidance provided in GHSA-2cwp-8g29-9q32 to unset the mod_auth_openidc_session cookies.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/osc/ondemand","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"6a7b588dd12821f4554a1be7fa11a6b6ab6c7dc1"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"4.0.8"}]}}],"versions":["v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.10","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.4.7","v1.4.8","v1.4.9","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.6","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.10","v1.6.11","v1.6.12","v1.6.12_citest","v1.6.13","v1.6.14","v1.6.15","v1.6.16","v1.6.17","v1.6.17-2","v1.6.18","v1.6.18_rc1","v1.6.18_rc2","v1.6.19","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.6.8_cr1","v1.6.8_cr3","v1.6.9","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-2","v1.7.0_rc1","v1.7.0_rc2","v1.7.1","v1.7.10","v1.7.10-2","v1.7.11","v1.7.12","v1.7.14","v1.7.2","v1.7.2_demo","v1.7.2_demo-2","v1.7.3","v1.7.3-2","v1.7.3-3","v1.7.4","v1.7.5","v1.7.6","v1.7.7","v1.7.7_rc1","v1.7.7_rc2","v1.7.7_rc3","v1.7.7_rc4","v1.7.7_rc5","v1.7.7_rc5-2","v1.7.8","v1.7.9","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.10","v1.8.11","v1.8.12","v1.8.13","v1.8.13-2","v1.8.14","v1.8.15","v1.8.16","v1.8.17","v1.8.18","v1.8.19-2","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.8.5","v1.8.6","v1.8.7","v1.8.8","v1.8.9","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.10","v2.0.11","v2.0.12","v2.0.13","v2.0.14","v2.0.15","v2.0.16","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.0.9","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-0.rc1","v2.1.0-0.rc2","v2.1.0-0.rc3","v2.1.0-0.rc4","v2.1.0-0.rc5","v2.1.0-0.rc6","v2.1.0-0.rc7","v2.1.0-0.rc8","v2.1.0-0.rc9","v2.1.0-0.start","v2.1.0-0.start.1","v2.1.0-0.start.2","v2.1.0-0.start.3","v2.1.0-0.start.4","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-0.rc1","v3.0.1","v3.1.0","v3.1.0-0.1.start.1","v3.1.0-0.rc1","v3.1.0-0.rc2","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-0.rc1","v4.0.0-0.start.1","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.5","v4.0.6","v4.0.7","v4.0.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66029.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66029.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/security/advisories/GHSA-2cwp-8g29-9q32"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66029"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-522","CWE-523"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66029.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
