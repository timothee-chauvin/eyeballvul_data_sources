If you do not use `NODE_ENV` in your user code to trigger security-sensitive functionality, you are not impacted by this vulnerability. Any dependencies that use `NODE_ENV` to trigger particular behaviors (optimizations, security or otherwise) should still respect your environment's configured `NODE_ENV` variable. The application's dependencies, as found in `node_modules` (including `@keystone-6/core`), are typically not compiled as part of this process, and thus should be unaffected. We have tested this assumption by verifying that `NODE_ENV=production yarn keystone start` still uses secure cookies when using `statelessSessions`. This vulnerability has been fixed in @keystone-6/core@3.0.2, regression tests have been added for this vulnerability in #8063.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone","events":[{"introduced":"d8892dd191c36df0a6e91029c75d1e6173080c32"},{"fixed":"c06c83ef952ea6c2e225d2550109c9a32b5e9d52"}]}],"versions":["@arch-ui/alert@0.0.17","@arch-ui/alert@0.0.18","@arch-ui/badge@0.0.15","@arch-ui/badge@0.0.16","@arch-ui/badge@0.0.17","@arch-ui/button@0.0.18","@arch-ui/button@0.0.19","@arch-ui/button@0.0.20","@arch-ui/button@0.0.21","@arch-ui/button@0.0.22","@arch-ui/card@0.0.14","@arch-ui/card@0.0.15","@arch-ui/common@0.0.12","@arch-ui/confirm@0.0.18","@arch-ui/confirm@0.0.19","@arch-ui/confirm@0.0.20","@arch-ui/confirm@0.0.21","@arch-ui/confirm@0.0.22","@arch-ui/controls@0.1.7","@arch-ui/controls@0.1.8","@arch-ui/controls@0.1.9","@arch-ui/day-picker@0.0.23","@arch-ui/day-picker@0.0.24","@arch-ui/day-picker@0.0.25","@arch-ui/day-picker@0.0.26","@arch-ui/day-picker@1.0.0","@arch-ui/day-picker@1.0.1","@arch-ui/day-picker@1.0.2","@arch-ui/day-picker@1.0.3","@arch-ui/day-picker@1.0.4","@arch-ui/day-picker@1.0.5","@arch-ui/dialog@0.0.20","@arch-ui/dialog@0.0.21","@arch-ui/dialog@0.0.22","@arch-ui/dialog@0.0.23","@arch-ui/dialog@0.0.24","@arch-ui/drawer@0.0.21","@arch-ui/drawer@0.0.22","@arch-ui/drawer@0.0.23","@arch-ui/drawer@0.0.24","@arch-ui/dropdown@0.0.17","@arch-ui/dropdown@0.0.18","@arch-ui/dropdown@0.0.19","@arch-ui/dropdown@0.0.20","@arch-ui/dropdown@0.0.21","@arch-ui/fields@3.0.0","@arch-ui/fields@3.0.1","@arch-ui/fields@3.0.2","@arch-ui/fields@3.0.3","@arch-ui/fields@3.0.4","@arch-ui/fields@3.0.5","@arch-ui/filters@0.0.19","@arch-ui/filters@0.0.20","@arch-ui/hooks@0.0.10","@arch-ui/hooks@0.0.11","@arch-ui/icons@0.1.0","@arch-ui/icons@0.1.1","@arch-ui/icons@0.1.2","@arch-ui/icons@0.1.3","@arch-ui/input@0.1.10","@arch-ui/input@0.1.11","@arch-ui/input@0.1.8","@arch-ui/input@0.1.9","@arch-ui/layout@0.2.12","@arch-ui/layout@0.2.13","@arch-ui/layout@0.2.14","@arch-ui/loading@0.0.17","@arch-ui/loading@0.0.18","@arch-ui/lozenge@0.0.16","@arch-ui/lozenge@0.0.17","@arch-ui/modal-utils@1.0.10","@arch-ui/modal-utils@1.0.11","@arch-ui/modal-utils@1.0.12","@arch-ui/modal-utils@1.0.13","@arch-ui/navbar@0.1.10","@arch-ui/navbar@0.1.11","@arch-ui/navbar@0.1.12","@arch-ui/navbar@0.1.9","@arch-ui/options@0.0.18","@arch-ui/options@0.0.19","@arch-ui/options@0.0.20","@arch-ui/options@0.0.21","@arch-ui/options@0.0.22","@arch-ui/options@0.0.23","@arch-ui/options@0.0.24","@arch-ui/pagination@0.0.18","@arch-ui/pagination@0.0.19","@arch-ui/pagination@0.0.20","@arch-ui/pagination@0.0.21","@arch-ui/pagination@0.0.22","@arch-ui/pagination@0.0.23","@arch-ui/pagination@0.0.24","@arch-ui/pagination@0.0.25","@arch-ui/pagination@0.0.26","@arch-ui/pill@0.1.14","@arch-ui/pill@0.1.15","@arch-ui/pill@0.1.16","@arch-ui/pill@0.1.17","@arch-ui/pill@0.1.18","@arch-ui/popout@0.0.18","@arch-ui/popout@0.0.19","@arch-ui/popout@0.0.20","@arch-ui/popout@0.0.21","@arch-ui/popout@0.0.22","@arch-ui/select@0.1.7","@arch-ui/select@0.1.8","@arch-ui/select@0.1.9","@arch-ui/theme@0.0.11","@arch-ui/tooltip@0.1.11","@arch-ui/tooltip@0.1.12","@arch-ui/tooltip@0.1.13","@arch-ui/tooltip@0.1.14","@arch-ui/typography@0.0.17","@arch-ui/typography@0.0.18","@keystonejs/access-control@6.0.0","@keystonejs/access-control@6.1.0","@keystonejs/access-control@6.2.0","@keystonejs/access-control@6.3.0","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@10.0.0","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@10.0.1","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@10.0.2","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@10.1.0","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@11.0.0","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@11.0.1","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@11.0.2","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@11.0.3","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@11.0.4","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@11.0.5","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@11.0.6","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@11.0.7","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@12.0.0","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@12.0.1","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@12.0.2","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@9.0.2","@keystonejs/adapter-knex@9.0.3","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@10.0.0","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@8.0.2","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@8.1.0","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@8.1.1","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@8.1.2","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@8.1.3","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@9.0.0","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@9.0.1","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@9.0.2","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@9.0.3","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@9.0.4","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@9.0.5","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@9.0.6","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@9.0.7","@keystonejs/adapter-mongoose@9.0.8","@keystonejs/adapter-prisma@1.0.0","@keystonejs/adapter-prisma@1.0.1","@keystonejs/adapter-prisma@1.0.2","@keystonejs/adapter-prisma@1.0.3","@keystonejs/adapter-prisma@1.0.4","@keystonejs/adapter-prisma@1.0.5","@keystonejs/adapter-prisma@1.0.6","@keystonejs/apollo-helpers@5.1.4","@keystonejs/apollo-helpers@5.1.5","@keystonejs/apollo-helpers@5.1.6","@keystonejs/apollo-helpers@5.1.7","@keystonejs/apollo-helpers@5.1.8","@keystonejs/app-admin-ui@5.10.0","@keystonejs/app-admin-ui@5.11.0","@keystonejs/app-admin-ui@5.11.1","@keystonejs/app-admin-ui@5.12.0","@keys
