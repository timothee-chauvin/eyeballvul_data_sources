{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-31127","published":"2022-07-06T18:00:16Z","modified":"2025-11-04T19:32:39Z","aliases":["GHSA-pgjx-7f9g-9463"],"summary":"Improper handling of email input in next-auth","details":"NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth","events":[{"introduced":"29b67b664785ba086008159e69c5e22969f69b48"},{"fixed":"2adfadefdc14aad9fbd19d9534e9261f9bff8ede"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31127.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/commit/ae834f1e08a4a9915665eecb9479c74c6b039c9c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/releases/tag/next-auth%40v4.9.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-pgjx-7f9g-9463"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/upgrade-v4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://next-auth.js.org/providers/email#customizing-emails"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
