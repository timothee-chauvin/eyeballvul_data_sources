A Mass assignment vulnerability was found in versions prior to 0.17.1 and 0.18.6 that allows a non-admin user to escalate privileges to those of an admin user. The issue is patched in 0.17.1 and fixed in 0.18.6. If Users are using 0.17.1, they should run `docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.17.1` and `docker-compose up -d`. This will switch them to the patched users If users are using v0.18.0-0.18.5, they should upgrade to v0.18.6 or later. As a workaround, someone using version 0.17.1 can pull the latest docker image of the backend and restart the server.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"72526ebd32fcc590a66a59013a4c5553e31d18d4"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.17.1"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker","events":[{"introduced":"351abde8b8edbdcea1d7468648f4b2f430a98c71"},{"fixed":"a498fc43c9eb7a23f46bfdfd9134188affc0521b"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0.18.0"},{"fixed":"0.18.6"}]}}],"versions":["0.7","v0.1","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.11.1-testing","v0.11.1_testing","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.5-testing","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.1-testing","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.14.4","v0.14.5","v0.14.6","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.16.3","v0.17.0","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.18.3","v0.18.4","v0.18.5","v0.2","v0.3","v0.5","v0.5-beta","v0.5.10","v0.5.11","v0.5.5","v0.7","v0.7.1","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-32079.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/32xxx/CVE-2023-32079.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/security/advisories/GHSA-826j-8wp2-4x6q"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32079"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-915"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/32xxx/CVE-2023-32079.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
