  "summary": "FTP-KRB double free",
  "details": "libcurl can be told to use kerberos over FTP to a server, as set with the\n`CURLOPT_KRBLEVEL` option.\n\nDuring such kerberos FTP data transfer, the server sends data to curl in\nblocks with the 32 bit size of each block first and then that amount of data\nimmediately following.\n\nA malicious or just broken server can claim to send a very large block and if\nby doing that it makes curl's subsequent call to `realloc()` to fail, curl\nwould then misbehave in the exit path and double free the memory.\n\nIn practical terms, an up to 4 GB memory area may very well be fine to\nallocate on a modern 64 bit system but on 32 bit systems it fails.\n\nKerberos FTP is a rarely used protocol with curl. Also, Kerberos\nauthentication is usually only attempted and used with servers that the client\nhas a previous association with.",
