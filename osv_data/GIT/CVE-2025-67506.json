Versions prior to 0.1.0-beta expose POST /api/v1/record/buffer/convert through missing authentication. The endpoint accepts a file upload and converts it to PDF via LibreOffice by uploading payload to os.path.join(tmpdir, file.filename) without normalizing the filename. An attacker can submit a crafted filename containing ../ sequences to write arbitrary files anywhere the service account has permission, enabling remote file overwrite or planting malicious code. This issue is fixed in version 0.1.0-beta.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"98987d8d11d13650ae839bc9cd9bebda6164e05d"}]}],"versions":["0.1.2-alpha","v0.1.0-alpha","v0.1.1-alpha"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67506.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67506.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai/commit/987ebab40a1fc39956730ed93220f7f9b2c4e5f8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai/security/advisories/GHSA-w398-9m55-2357"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67506"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-434"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67506.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
