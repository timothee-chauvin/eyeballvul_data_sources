A maliciously crafted filename can cause the Content-Disposition header to be sent with an unexpected filename value or otherwise modify the Content-Disposition header. For example, a filename of \"setup.bat&quot;;x=.txt\" will be sent as a file named \"setup.bat\". If the FileAttachment function is called with names provided by an untrusted source, this may permit an attacker to cause a file to be served with a name different than provided. Maliciously crafted attachment file name can modify the Content-Disposition header.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4ea0e648e38a63d6caff14100f5eab5c50912bcd"}]}],"versions":["v0.1","v0.2b","v0.3","v0.4","v0.5","v0.6","v1.0","v1.0-rc.2","v1.0rc1","v1.1","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.2","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-29401.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/releases/tag/v1.9.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1737"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/3555"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/pull/3556"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
