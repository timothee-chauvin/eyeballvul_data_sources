{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-32678","published":"2023-08-25T20:04:49.432Z","modified":"2025-12-04T23:51:38.799965Z","aliases":["GHSA-q3wg-jm9p-35fj"],"summary":"Zulip vulnerable to insufficient authorization check for edition/deletion of messages and topics in private streams by former subscribers","details":"Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool with topic-based threading that combines email and chat. Users who used to be subscribed to a private stream and have been removed from it since retain the ability to edit messages/topics, move messages to other streams, and delete messages that they used to have access to, if other relevant organization permissions allow these actions. For example, a user may be able to edit or delete their old messages they posted in such a private stream. An administrator will be able to delete old messages (that they had access to) from the private stream. This issue was fixed in Zulip Server version 7.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b85046eb08ad38226ebd62f47856a2cb15d1154a"}]}],"versions":["1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.10","1.3.11","1.3.12","1.3.13","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.5","1.3.6","1.3.7","1.3.8","1.3.9","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.6.0","1.7.0","1.8.0","1.8.0-rc1","1.9.0","1.9.0-rc2","1.9.0-rc3","2.0.0","2.0.0-rc1","2.1-dev","2.1.0","2.1.0-rc1","2.2-dev","3.0","3.0-dev","3.0-rc1","3.0-rc2","4.0","4.0-dev","5.0","5.0-dev","6.0","6.0-dev","7.0","7.0-beta3","7.0-dev","7.1","7.2","enterprise-1.1.5","enterprise-1.2.0","shared-0.0.1","shared-0.0.10","shared-0.0.11","shared-0.0.12","shared-0.0.13","shared-0.0.14","shared-0.0.15","shared-0.0.16","shared-0.0.17","shared-0.0.18","shared-0.0.2","shared-0.0.3","shared-0.0.4","shared-0.0.5","shared-0.0.6","shared-0.0.7","shared-0.0.8","shared-0.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-32678.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/32xxx/CVE-2023-32678.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-q3wg-jm9p-35fj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32678"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/changelog.html#zulip-server-7-3"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-285"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/32xxx/CVE-2023-32678.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
