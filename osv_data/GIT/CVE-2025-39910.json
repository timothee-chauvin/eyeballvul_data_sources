{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-39910","published":"2025-10-01T07:44:33.759Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:11:16.806183Z","summary":"mm/vmalloc, mm/kasan: respect gfp mask in kasan_populate_vmalloc()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/vmalloc, mm/kasan: respect gfp mask in kasan_populate_vmalloc()\n\nkasan_populate_vmalloc() and its helpers ignore the caller's gfp_mask and\nalways allocate memory using the hardcoded GFP_KERNEL flag.  This makes\nthem inconsistent with vmalloc(), which was recently extended to support\nGFP_NOFS and GFP_NOIO allocations.\n\nPage table allocations performed during shadow population also ignore the\nexternal gfp_mask.  To preserve the intended semantics of GFP_NOFS and\nGFP_NOIO, wrap the apply_to_page_range() calls into the appropriate\nmemalloc scope.\n\nxfs calls vmalloc with GFP_NOFS, so this bug could lead to deadlock.\n\nThere was a report here\nhttps://lkml.kernel.org/r/686ea951.050a0220.385921.0016.GAE@google.com\n\nThis patch:\n - Extends kasan_populate_vmalloc() and helpers to take gfp_mask;\n - Passes gfp_mask down to alloc_pages_bulk() and __get_free_page();\n - Enforces GFP_NOFS/NOIO semantics with memalloc_*_save()/restore()\n   around apply_to_page_range();\n - Updates vmalloc.c and percpu allocator call sites accordingly.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"451769ebb7e792c3404db53b3c2a422990de654e"},{"fixed":"33b95d90427cb4babf32059e323a6d0c027610fe"},{"fixed":"79357cd06d41d0f5a11b17d7c86176e395d10ef2"}]}],"versions":["v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.16.1","v6.16.2","v6.16.3","v6.16.4","v6.16.5","v6.16.6","v6.16.7","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39910.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39910.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/33b95d90427cb4babf32059e323a6d0c027610fe"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/79357cd06d41d0f5a11b17d7c86176e395d10ef2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/39xxx/CVE-2025-39910.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39910"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/39xxx/CVE-2025-39910.json"}}
