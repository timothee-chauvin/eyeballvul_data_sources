There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed","events":[{"introduced":"7149ff90e030daff312bf973d5c9b219e0fa6061"},{"fixed":"9c12a6414fc12d6bb81cea387efded16f0301fc5"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"15.0.0"},{"fixed":"15.0.8"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed","events":[{"introduced":"a0ebfedbce625d43d0a05d72e96df3b0e5a3ef9e"},{"fixed":"0943b6b7e836f8022d780aeacf0ca02ab62f8b1e"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"16.0.0"},{"fixed":"16.0.6"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed","events":[{"introduced":"efe34dacf66f4f36b5d47eb92632f4b1d2aab7cd"},{"fixed":"6a7a29285d519b246523cd1cbb9b1e6489920531"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"17.0.0"},{"fixed":"17.1.1"}]}}],"versions":["v15.0.0","v15.0.1","v15.0.2","v15.0.3","v15.0.4","v15.0.5","v15.0.6","v15.0.7","v16.0.0","v16.0.1","v16.0.2","v16.0.3","v16.0.4","v16.0.5","v17.0.0","v17.0.1","v17.0.2","v17.0.3","v17.1.0","v17.1.0-rc.1","v17.1.0-rc.2","v17.1.0-rc.3","v17.1.0-rc.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-45149.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/talk-android","events":[{"introduced":"920e441960fb103e040a5d1ae2da1626ed5b8b83"},{"fixed":"3d39b577820b92b77ab9760afbe313bae47c8ce4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-45149.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/45xxx/CVE-2023-45149.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-7rf8-pqmj-rpqv"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/pull/10545"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/2094473"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45149"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-307"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/45xxx/CVE-2023-45149.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
