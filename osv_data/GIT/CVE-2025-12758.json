This can lead to an application using isLength for input validation accepting strings significantly longer than intended, resulting in issues like data truncation in databases, buffer overflows in other system components, or denial-of-service.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f2b5c17dbe03f2ca9ad9122c597f81e86ce1a9a1"}]}],"versions":["0.5.0","1.0.0","1.1.0","1.1.2","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.3.0","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.5.1","10.0.0","10.1.0","10.10.0","10.11.0","10.2.0","10.3.0","10.4.0","10.5.0","10.6.0","10.7.0","10.7.1","10.8.0","10.9.0","11.0.0","11.1.0","12.0.0","12.1.0","12.2.0","13.0.0","13.1.0","13.1.1","13.11.0","13.12.0","13.15.0","13.15.15","13.15.20","13.5.0","13.6.0","13.6.1","13.7.0","13.9.0","2.0.0","2.1.0","3.0.0","3.1.0","3.10.0","3.11.0","3.11.1","3.11.2","3.12.0","3.13.0","3.14.0","3.14.1","3.15.0","3.16.0","3.16.1","3.16.2","3.17.0","3.17.1","3.17.2","3.18.0","3.18.1","3.19.0","3.19.1","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.20.0","3.21.0","3.22.0","3.22.1","3.22.2","3.23.0","3.24.0","3.25.0","3.26.0","3.27.0","3.28.0","3.29.0","3.3.0","3.30.0","3.31.0","3.32.0","3.33.0","3.34.0","3.35.0","3.36.0","3.37.0","3.38.0","3.39.0","3.4.0","3.40.0","3.40.1","3.41.0","3.41.1","3.41.2","3.41.3","3.42.0","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.6.0","3.7.0","3.8.0","3.9.0","4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.0.4","4.0.5","4.0.6","4.1.0","4.2.0","4.3.0","4.4.0","4.4.1","4.5.0","4.5.1","4.5.2","4.6.0","4.6.1","4.7.0","4.7.1","4.8.0","4.9.0","5.0.0","5.1.0","5.2.0","5.3.0","5.4.0","5.5.0","5.6.0","5.7.0","6.0.0","6.1.0","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.3.0","7.0.0","7.1.0","7.2.0","8.0.0","8.1.0","8.2.0","9.0.0","9.1.0","9.1.1","9.1.2","9.2.0","9.3.0","9.4.0","9.4.1","v13.1.17"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-12758.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://gist.github.com/koral--/ad31208b25b9e3d1e2e35f1d4d72572e"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-VALIDATOR-13653476"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js/pull/2616"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
