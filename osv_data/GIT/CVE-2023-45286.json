This condition can be triggered by calling sync.Pool.Put with the same *bytes.Buffer more than once, when request retries are enabled and a retry occurs. The call to sync.Pool.Get will then return a bytes.Buffer that hasn't had bytes.Buffer.Reset called on it. This dirty buffer will contain the HTTP request body from an unrelated request, and go-resty will append the current HTTP request body to it, sending two bodies in one request. The sync.Pool in question is defined at package level scope, so a completely unrelated server could receive the request body.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/go-resty/resty","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"577fed8730d79f583eb48dfc81674164e1fc471e"}]}],"versions":["v0.1","v0.10","v0.11","v0.12","v0.13","v0.2","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.3","v0.4","v0.4.1","v0.5","v0.6","v0.7","v0.8","v0.9","v1.0","v1.1","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.2","v1.3","v1.4","v1.5","v1.6","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-rc.1","v2.0.0-rc.2","v2.0.0-rc.3","v2.0.0-rc.4","v2.1.0","v2.10.0","v2.10.0-rc.1","v2.10.0-rc.2","v2.10.0-rc.3","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.0-rc.1","v2.3.0-rc.2","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0","v2.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-45286.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2328"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/go-resty/resty/issues/739"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/go-resty/resty/issues/743"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/go-resty/resty/pull/745"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/go-resty/resty/commit/577fed8730d79f583eb48dfc81674164e1fc471e"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
