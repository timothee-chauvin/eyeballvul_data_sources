Passing the 32 bit hash\nreturned by skb_get_hash() can lead to problems related to the fact that\n'int hash' is a negative number when the MSB is set.\n\nIn the case of hash threshold nexthop groups, nexthop_select_path_hthr()\nwill disproportionately select the first nexthop group entry. In the case\nof resilient nexthop groups, nexthop_select_path_res() may do an out of\nbounds access in nh_buckets[], for example:\n    hash = -912054133\n    num_nh_buckets = 2\n    bucket_index = 65535\n\nwhich leads to the following panic:\n\nBUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffc900025910c8\nPGD 100000067 P4D 100000067 PUD 10026b067 PMD 0\nOops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN
