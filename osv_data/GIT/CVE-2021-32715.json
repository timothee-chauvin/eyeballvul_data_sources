{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-32715","published":"2021-07-07T20:15:08.750Z","modified":"2025-11-20T11:46:29.474594Z","aliases":["GHSA-f3pg-qwvg-p99c","RUSTSEC-2021-0078"],"related":["GHSA-f3pg-qwvg-p99c","openSUSE-SU-2024:11751-1"],"details":"hyper is an HTTP library for rust. hyper's HTTP/1 server code had a flaw that incorrectly parses and accepts requests with a `Content-Length` header with a prefixed plus sign, when it should have been rejected as illegal. This combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that doesn't parse such `Content-Length` headers, but forwards them, can result in \"request smuggling\" or \"desync attacks\". The flaw exists in all prior versions of hyper prior to 0.14.10, if built with `rustc` v1.5.0 or newer. The vulnerability is patched in hyper version 0.14.10. Two workarounds exist: One may reject requests manually that contain a plus sign prefix in the `Content-Length` header or ensure any upstream proxy handles `Content-Length` headers with a plus sign prefix.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9b69cbc2543e437f17c4a028b734f55928358675"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.10","v0.1.11","v0.1.12","v0.1.13","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.1.9","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.11.10","v0.11.11","v0.11.12","v0.11.13","v0.11.14","v0.11.15","v0.11.16","v0.11.17","v0.11.18","v0.11.19","v0.11.2","v0.11.20","v0.11.21","v0.11.22","v0.11.3","v0.11.4","v0.11.5","v0.11.6","v0.11.7","v0.11.8","v0.11.9","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.10","v0.12.11","v0.12.12","v0.12.13","v0.12.14","v0.12.15","v0.12.16","v0.12.17","v0.12.18","v0.12.19","v0.12.2","v0.12.20","v0.12.21","v0.12.22","v0.12.23","v0.12.24","v0.12.25","v0.12.26","v0.12.27","v0.12.28","v0.12.29","v0.12.3","v0.12.30","v0.12.31","v0.12.32","v0.12.4","v0.12.5","v0.12.6","v0.12.7","v0.12.8","v0.12.9","v0.13.0","v0.13.0-alpha.1","v0.13.0-alpha.2","v0.13.0-alpha.3","v0.13.0-alpha.4","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.13.3","v0.13.4","v0.13.5","v0.13.6","v0.13.7","v0.13.8","v0.13.9","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.14.4","v0.14.5","v0.14.6","v0.14.7","v0.14.8","v0.14.9","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.10","v0.3.11","v0.3.12","v0.3.13","v0.3.14","v0.3.15","v0.3.16","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.3.8","v0.3.9","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.10","v0.6.11","v0.6.12","v0.6.14","v0.6.16","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v0.6.8","v0.6.9","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32715.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/security/advisories/GHSA-f3pg-qwvg-p99c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/28826/commits/123a83326fb95366e94a3be1a74775df4db97739"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
