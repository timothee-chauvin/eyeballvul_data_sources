Prior to version 1.44.2, on schemas involving arrows with caveats on the arrow’ed relation, when the path to resolve a CheckPermission request involves the evaluation of multiple caveated branches, requests may return a negative response when a positive response is expected. Version 1.44.2 fixes the issue. As a workaround, do not use caveats in the schema over an arrow’ed relation.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"67779dc3b2ba54c1763c421263fe23c18abac8a2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-49011.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/fe8dd9f491f6975b3408c401e413a530eb181a67"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.44.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-cwwm-hr97-qfxm"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-358"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
