In versions 1.26.3 and below, due to a bypass of double clickjacking protection (confirmation dialog), it is possible to trick the admin into clicking the Promote button in another user's management page after the admin double clicks on a button inside an attacker-controlled website. A successful attack can allow the attacker to promote themselves to \"admin\" and log into other users' accounts; the attacker has to know the specific instance URL they're targeting. This issue is fixed in version 1.27.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freshrss/freshrss","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"66e2f00223b915c337291c0f34876d6390fb1c80"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.7.3","0.7.4","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.9.0","0.9.1","0.9.2","0.9.3","0.9.4","1.0.0","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2-beta","1.1.3-beta","1.10.0","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.11.0","1.11.1","1.11.2","1.12.0","1.13.0","1.13.1","1.14.0","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.15.0","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.15.3","1.16.0","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.17.0","1.18.0","1.18.1","1.19.0","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.2.0","1.20.0","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.21.0","1.22.0","1.22.1","1.23.0","1.23.1","1.24.0","1.24.1","1.24.2","1.24.3","1.25.0","1.26.0","1.26.1","1.26.2","1.26.3","1.3.0-beta","1.3.1-beta","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.7.0","1.8.0","1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59950.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/security/advisories/GHSA-j66v-hvqx-5vh3"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/pull/7771"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/releases/tag/1.27.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1021"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
