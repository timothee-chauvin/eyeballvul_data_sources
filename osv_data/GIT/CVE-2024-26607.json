Now the sii902x bridge is ready from\n  DRM's perspective.\n- sii902x calls sii902x_audio_codec_init() and\n  platform_device_register_data()\n- The registration of the audio platform device causes probing of the\n  deferred devices.\n- tidss probes, which eventually causes sii902x_bridge_get_edid() to be\n  called.\n- sii902x_bridge_get_edid() tries to use the i2c to read the edid.\n  However, the sii902x driver has not set up the i2c part yet, leading\n  to the crash.\n\nFix this by moving the drm_bridge_add() to the end of the\nsii902x_init(), which is also at the very end of
