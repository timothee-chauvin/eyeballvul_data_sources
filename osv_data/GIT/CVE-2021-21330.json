In aiohttp before version 3.7.4 there is an open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link to an aiohttp-based web-server could redirect the browser to a different website. It is caused by a bug in the `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` middleware. This security problem has been fixed in 3.7.4. Upgrade your dependency using pip as follows \"pip install aiohttp >= 3.7.4\". If upgrading is not an option for you, a workaround can be to avoid using `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` in your applications.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2545222a3853e31ace15d87ae0e2effb7da0c96b"}]}],"versions":["0.15.2","0.8.2","1.3.0","2.0.0","2.0.0rc1","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.3-1","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","4v0.21.6","v.0.6.5","v0.1","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.14.4","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.15.3","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.16.3","v0.16.4","v0.16.5","v0.16.6","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.17.3","v0.17.4","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.18.3","v0.18.4","v0.19.0","v0.2","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.21.0","v0.21.0a0","v0.21.0a1","v0.21.0a2","v0.21.1","v0.21.2","v0.21.3","v0.21.4","v0.21.5","v0.21.6","v0.22.0","v0.22.0b0","v0.22.0b1","v0.22.0b2","v0.22.0b3","v0.22.0b4","v0.22.0b5","v0.22.0b6","v0.22.1","v0.22.2","v0.22.3","v0.22.4","v0.22.5","v0.3","v0.4","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.2.0","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.2.5","v2.3.0","v2.3.0a1","v2.3.0a2","v2.3.0a3","v2.3.0a4","v2.3.1","v2.3.10","v2.3.1a1","v2.3.2","v2.3.2b1","v2.3.2b2","v2.3.2b3","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.7","v2.3.8","v2.3.9","v3.0.0","v3.0.0b0","v3.0.0b1","v3.0.0b2","v3.0.0b3","v3.0.0b4","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.0.8","v3.0.9","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.2","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.1b1","v3.3.2","v3.3.2a0","v3.4.0","v3.4.0a0","v3.4.0a3","v3.4.0b1","v3.4.0b2","v3.4.1","v3.4.2","v3.4.3","v3.4.4","v3.5.0","v3.5.0a1","v3.5.0b1","v3.5.0b2","v3.5.0b3","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.5.3","v3.5.4","v3.6.0","v3.6.0a0","v3.6.0a1","v3.6.0a10","v3.6.0a11","v3.6.0a12","v3.6.0a2","v3.6.0a3","v3.6.0a4","v3.6.0a5","v3.6.0a6","v3.6.0a7","v3.6.0a8","v3.6.0a9","v3.6.0b0","v3.6.1","v3.6.1b3","v3.6.1b4","v3.6.2","v3.6.2a1","v3.6.2a2","v4.0.0a0","v4.0.0a1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-21330.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#374-2021-02-25"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/2545222a3853e31ace15d87ae0e2effb7da0c96b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wp-4m6f-gcjg"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-19"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4864"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FU7ENI54JNEK3PHEFGCE46DGMFNTVU6L/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JN3V7CZJRT4QFCVXB6LDPCJH7NAOFCA5/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
