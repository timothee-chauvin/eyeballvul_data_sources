Don't leave consecutive consumed OOB skbs.","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naf_unix: Don't leave consecutive consumed OOB skbs.\n\nJann Horn reported a use-after-free in unix_stream_read_generic().\n\nThe following sequences reproduce the issue:\n\n  $ python3\n  from socket import *\n  s1, s2 = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM)\n  s1.send(b'x', MSG_OOB)\n  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb\n  s1.send(b'y', MSG_OOB)\n  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb\n  s1.send(b'z', MSG_OOB)\n  s2.recv(1)              # recv 'z' illegally\n  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # access 'z' skb (use-after-free)\n\nEven though a user reads OOB data, the skb holding the data stays on\nthe recv queue to mark the OOB boundary and break the next recv().\n\nAfter the last send() in the scenario above, the sk2's recv queue has\n2 leading consumed OOB skbs and 1 real OOB skb.\n\nThen, the following happens during the next recv() without MSG_OOB\n\n  1. unix_stream_read_generic() peeks the first consumed OOB skb\n  2. manage_oob() returns the next consumed OOB skb\n  3. unix_stream_read_generic() fetches the next not-yet-consumed OOB skb\n  4. unix_stream_read_generic() reads and frees the OOB skb\n\n, and the last recv(MSG_OOB) triggers KASAN splat.\n\nThe 3. above occurs because of the SO_PEEK_OFF code, which does not\nexpect unix_skb_len(skb) to be 0, but this is true for such consumed\nOOB skbs.\n\n  while (skip >= unix_skb_len(skb)) {\n    skip -= unix_skb_len(skb);\n    skb = skb_peek_next(skb, &sk->sk_receive_queue);\n    ...\n  }\n\nIn addition to this use-after-free, there is another issue that\nioctl(SIOCATMARK) does not function properly with consecutive consumed\nOOB skbs.\n\nSo, nothing good comes out of such a situation.\n\nInstead of complicating manage_oob(), ioctl() handling, and the next\nECONNRESET fix by introducing a loop for consecutive consumed OOB skbs,\nlet's not leave such consecutive OOB unnecessarily.\n\nNow, while receiving an OOB skb in unix_stream_recv_urg(), if its\nprevious skb is a consumed OOB skb, it is freed.\n\n[0]:\nBUG: KASAN:
