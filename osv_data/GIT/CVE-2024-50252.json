The problem is that the\nnew remote address is never added by the driver to its hash table (and\ntherefore the device) and the old address is never removed from it.\n\nFix by programming the new address when the configuration of the ip6gre\nnet device changes and removing the old one. If the address did not\nchange, then the above would result in increasing the reference count of\nthe address and then decreasing it.\n\n[1]\n # ip link add name bla up type ip6gre local 2001:db8:1::1
