{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68118","published":"2025-12-17T22:01:14.722Z","modified":"2026-01-04T05:42:31.378206Z","aliases":["GHSA-h78c-5cjx-jw6x"],"summary":"Potential Heap Out-of-Bounds Read in freerdp_certificate_data_hash_ via Unsafe _snprintf Usage","details":"FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.20.0, a vulnerability exists in FreeRDP’s certificate handling code on Windows platforms. The function `freerdp_certificate_data_hash_ uses` the Microsoft-specific `_snprintf` function to format certificate cache filenames without guaranteeing NUL termination when truncation occurs. According to Microsoft documentation, `_snprintf` does not append a terminating NUL byte if the formatted output exceeds the destination buffer size. If an attacker controls the hostname value (for example via server redirection or a crafted .rdp file), the resulting filename buffer may not be NUL-terminated. Subsequent string operations performed on this buffer may read beyond the allocated memory region, resulting in a heap-based out-of-bounds read. In default configurations, the connection is typically terminated before sensitive data can be meaningfully exposed, but unintended memory read or a client crash may still occur under certain conditions. Version 3.20.0 has a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freerdp/freerdp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b8e790a02ede8dd64ff7177fb9027d1844e66bb6"}]}],"versions":["1.0-beta1","1.0-beta2","1.0-beta3","1.0-beta4","1.0-beta5","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0-beta+2013071101","1.1.0-beta1","1.1.0-beta1+android2","1.1.0-beta1+android3","1.1.0-beta1+android4","1.1.0-beta1+android5","1.1.0-beta1+ios1","1.1.0-beta1+ios2","1.1.0-beta1+ios3","1.1.0-beta1+ios4","1.2.0-beta1+android7","1.2.0-beta1+android9","2.0.0","2.0.0-beta1+android10","2.0.0-beta1+android11","2.0.0-rc0","2.0.0-rc1","2.0.0-rc2","2.0.0-rc3","2.0.0-rc4","3.0.0","3.0.0-beta1","3.0.0-beta2","3.0.0-beta3","3.0.0-beta4","3.0.0-rc0","3.1.0","3.10.0","3.10.1","3.10.2","3.10.3","3.11.0","3.11.1","3.12.0","3.13.0","3.14.0","3.14.1","3.15.0","3.16.0","3.17.0","3.17.1","3.17.2","3.18.0","3.19.0","3.19.1","3.2.0","3.3.0","3.4.0","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.6.0","3.6.1","3.6.2","3.6.3","3.7.0","3.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68118.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68118.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/commit/a0b21f992a9de1de2468fc9e600aa2b7a4066307"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/security/advisories/GHSA-h78c-5cjx-jw6x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68118"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-125"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68118.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
