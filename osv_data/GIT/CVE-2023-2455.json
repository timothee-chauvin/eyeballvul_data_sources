This scenario can happen under security definer functions or when a common user and query is planned initially and then re-used across multiple SET ROLEs. Applying an incorrect policy may permit a user to complete otherwise-forbidden reads and modifications. This affects only databases that have used CREATE POLICY to define a row security policy.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git","events":[{"introduced":"19f20081df059fef87e14c8e953669bd173dd7f1"},{"fixed":"f96e531b1c079ae148b927a204845c7150a573f8"}]}],"versions":["REL_11_0","REL_11_1","REL_11_10","REL_11_11","REL_11_12","REL_11_13","REL_11_14","REL_11_15","REL_11_16","REL_11_17","REL_11_18","REL_11_19","REL_11_2","REL_11_3","REL_11_4","REL_11_5","REL_11_6","REL_11_7","REL_11_8","REL_11_9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-2455.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-2455"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230706-0006/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2023-2455/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
