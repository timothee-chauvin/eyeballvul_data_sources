If btrfs_iget()\nneeds to lookup the inode from the root's btree, because it's not\ncurrently loaded in memory, then it will need to lock another or the\nsame path in the same root btree. This may result in a deadlock and\ntrigger the following lockdep splat:\n\n  WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected\n  6.5.0-rc7-syzkaller-00004-gf7757129e3de #0 Not tainted\n
