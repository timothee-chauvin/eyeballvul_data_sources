This allows any user with a Lif Account to load any conversation between two users without permission. This issue had been patched in version 1.3.1. There is no action required for users. Lif Platforms will update their servers with the patch.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lif-platforms/new-ringer-server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3ff1b2c65fe646a4d5c3cdee5edd41ef9f22adb4"}]}],"versions":["1.2.0","1.2.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45050.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/45xxx/CVE-2024-45050.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Lif-Platforms/New-Ringer-Server/commit/ae795ff47b2ac2656ac6a099a0e7954ca7d9ba53"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Lif-Platforms/New-Ringer-Server/security/advisories/GHSA-cpc7-79cg-qv65"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45050"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-862"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/45xxx/CVE-2024-45050.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"}]}
