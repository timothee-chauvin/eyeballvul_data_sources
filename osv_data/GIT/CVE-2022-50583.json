If all member disks are rotational devices,\nraid0/raid10 set max_discard_sectors. So the member devices are\nnot ssd/nvme, but raid0/raid10 export the wrong value. It reports\nwarning messages in function __blkdev_issue_discard when mkfs.xfs\nlike this:\n\n[ 4616.022599] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[ 4616.027779] WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 99634 at
