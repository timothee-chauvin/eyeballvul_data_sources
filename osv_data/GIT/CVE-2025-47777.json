Versions prior to 0.11.1 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting in chatbot responses due to insufficient sanitization. This, in turn, can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via unsafe Electron protocol handling and exposed Electron APIs. All users of 5ire client versions prior to patched releases, particularly those interacting with untrusted chatbots or pasting external content, are affected. Version 0.11.1 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"313d2cf9d00918b1b37356fe8d09be524677556b"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.11.0","v0.7.9","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.5","v0.9.6","v0.9.7","v0.9.8","v0.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-47777.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/47xxx/CVE-2025-47777.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/commit/56601e012095194a4be0d4cb6da6b5b3cb53dea8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/security/advisories/GHSA-mr8w-mmvv-6hq8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47777"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://positive.security/blog/url-open-rce"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://shabarkin.notion.site/1-click-RCE-in-Electron-Applications-501c2e96e7934610979cd3c72e844a22"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROFYhS9E9eU"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-20","CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/47xxx/CVE-2025-47777.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
