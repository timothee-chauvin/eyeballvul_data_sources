{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-29172","published":"2022-05-05T22:50:09Z","modified":"2025-12-04T10:20:13.309630Z","aliases":["GHSA-7ww6-75fj-jcj7"],"summary":"HTML injection with additional signup fields","details":"Auth0 is an authentication broker that supports both social and enterprise identity providers, including Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps, and Salesforce. In versions before `11.33.0`, when the “additional signup fields” feature [is configured](https://github.com/auth0/lock#additional-sign-up-fields), a malicious actor can inject invalidated HTML code into these additional fields, which is then stored in the service `user_metdata` payload (using the `name` property). Verification emails, when applicable, are generated using this metadata. It is therefor possible for an actor to craft a malicious link by injecting HTML, which is then rendered as the recipient's name within the delivered email template. You are impacted by this vulnerability if you are using `auth0-lock` version `11.32.2` or lower and are using the “additional signup fields” feature in your application. Upgrade to version `11.33.0`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/auth0/lock","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"49e517d477246cee2c69cb05b03fdf602f062612"}]}],"versions":["v11.22.4","v11.26.1","v11.28.1","v11.30.5","v11.30.6","v11.31.0","v11.31.1","v11.32.0","v11.32.1","v11.32.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-29172.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/29xxx/CVE-2022-29172.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/auth0/lock/commit/79ae557d331274b114848150f19832ae341771b1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/auth0/lock/security/advisories/GHSA-7ww6-75fj-jcj7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29172"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/29xxx/CVE-2022-29172.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
