{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-54022","published":"2025-12-24T10:55:52.045Z","modified":"2025-12-24T20:11:59.889890Z","summary":"ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential memory leaks at error path for UMP open","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential memory leaks at error path for UMP open\n\nThe allocation and initialization errors at alloc_midi_urbs() that is\ncalled at MIDI 2.0 / UMP device are supposed to be handled at the\ncaller side by invoking free_midi_urbs().  However, free_midi_urbs()\nloops only for ep->num_urbs entries, and since ep->num_entries wasn't\nupdated yet at the allocation / init error in alloc_midi_urbs(), this\nentry won't be released.\n\nThe intention of free_midi_urbs() is to release the whole elements, so\nchange the loop size to NUM_URBS to scan over all elements for fixing\nthe missed releases.\n\nAlso, the call of free_midi_urbs() is missing at\nsnd_usb_midi_v2_open().  Although it'll be released later at\nreopen/close or disconnection, it's better to release immediately at\nthe error path.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ff49d1df79aef7580fe3ac99d17c3f886655d080"},{"fixed":"f819b343aa95d24d5f7d6e06660c7f62591abc5f"},{"fixed":"b1757fa30ef14f254f4719bf6f7d54a4c8207216"}]}],"versions":["v6.4","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.5.1","v6.5.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54022.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.5.0"},{"fixed":"6.5.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54022.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b1757fa30ef14f254f4719bf6f7d54a4c8207216"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f819b343aa95d24d5f7d6e06660c7f62591abc5f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54022.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54022"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54022.json"}}
