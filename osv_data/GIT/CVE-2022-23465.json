  "details": "SwiftTerm is a Xterm/VT100 Terminal emulator. Prior to commit a94e6b24d24ce9680ad79884992e1dff8e150a31, an attacker could modify the window title via a certain character escape sequence and then insert it back to the command line in the user's terminal, e.g. when the user views a file containing the malicious sequence, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Version a94e6b24d24ce9680ad79884992e1dff8e150a31 contains a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds available.",
