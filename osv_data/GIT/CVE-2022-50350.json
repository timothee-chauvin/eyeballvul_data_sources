and the login thread","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: target: iscsi: Fix a race condition between login_work and the login thread\n\nIn case a malicious initiator sends some random data immediately after a\nlogin PDU; the iscsi_target_sk_data_ready() callback will schedule the\nlogin_work and, at the same time, the negotiation may end without clearing\nthe LOGIN_FLAGS_INITIAL_PDU flag (because no additional PDU exchanges are\nrequired to complete the login).\n\nThe login has been completed but the login_work function will find the\nLOGIN_FLAGS_INITIAL_PDU flag set and will never stop from rescheduling\nitself; at this point, if the initiator drops the connection, the\niscsit_conn structure will be freed, login_work will dereference a released\nsocket structure and the kernel crashes.\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000230\nPF: supervisor write access in kernel mode\nPF: error_code(0x0002)
