When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/django/django","events":[{"introduced":"2a62cdcfec85938f40abb2e9e6a9ff497e02afe8"},{"fixed":"21a5547793a24357a985390970b489aeeca06d45"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-23336.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/python/cpython","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"aa73e1722eb9835dc99fd8983885a141112ee4ab"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-23336.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ra8ce70088ba291f358e077cafdb14d174b7a1ce9a9d86d1b332d6367%40%3Cusers.airflow.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rc005f4de9d9b0ba943ceb8ff5a21a5c6ff8a9df52632476698d99432%40%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf9fa47ab66495c78bb4120b0754dd9531ca2ff0430f6685ac9b07772%40%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3EPYWWFDV22CJ5AOH5VCE72DOASZZ255/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3YKKDLXL3UEZ3J426C2XTBS63AHE46SM/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/46N6A52EGSXHJYCZWVMBJJIH4NWIV2B5/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FONHJIOZOFD7CD35KZL6SVBUTMBPGZGA/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HCQTCSP6SCVIYNIRUJC5X7YBVUHPLSC4/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HZTM7KLHFCE3LWSEVO2NAFLUHMGYMCRY/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IHQDU7NXA7EWAE4W7VO6MURVJIULEPPR/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KJXCMHLY7H3FIYLE4OKDYUILU2CCRUCZ/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LVNH6Z24IG3E67ZCQGGJ46FZB4XFLQNZ/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MNUN5SOMFL2BBKP6ZAICIIUPQKZDMGYO/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MP572OLHMS7MZO4KUPSCIMSZIA5IZZ62/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N6VXJZSZ6N64AILJX4CTMACYGQGHHD5C/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NJSCSN722JO2E2AGPWD4NTGVELVRPB4R/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NODWHDIFBQE5RU5PUWUVE47JOT5VCMJ2/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OAGSWNGZJ6HQ5ISA67SNMK3CJRKICET7/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RSLQD5CCM75IZGAMBDGUZEATYU5YSGJ7/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SGIY6I4YS3WOXAK4SXKIEOC2G4VZKIR7/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TFTELUMWZE3KV3JB2H5EE6VFRZFRD5MV/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/W2LSKBEFI5SYEY5FM6ICZVZM5WRQUCS4/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/02/19/4"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/01/2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/24297"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/02/msg00030.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/04/msg00005.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/04/msg00015.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202104-04"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210326-0004/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://snyk.io/blog/cache-poisoning-in-popular-open-source-packages/"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-UPSTREAM-PYTHONCPYTHON-1074933"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.ht
