{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-33028","published":"2025-04-15T18:15:53Z","modified":"2025-10-26T03:33:41Z","details":"In WinZip through 29.0, there is a Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2024-8811. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of WinZip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of archived files. When extracting files from a crafted archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, WinZip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. NOTE: a third party has reported that this is a false positive, and has observed that the original CVE-2025-33028.md file has been deleted on GitHub. Also, this is disputed because Mark-of-the-Web propagation can increase risk via security-warning habituation, and because the intended control sphere for file-origin metadata (e.g., HostUrl in Zone.Identifier) may be narrower than that for reading the file's content.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/enisaksu/argonis","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5e1ff4e5f4fdb3f32aab465f7b429e0b91299d1d"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-33028.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/EnisAksu/Argonis/commit/5e1ff4e5f4fdb3f32aab465f7b429e0b91299d1d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/EnisAksu/Argonis/blob/main/CVEs/CVE-2025-33028%20%28WinZip%29/CVE-2025-33028.md"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://kb.winzip.com/help/help_whatsnew.htm"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
