{
  "id": "CVE-2021-22547",
  "details": "In IoT Devices SDK, there is an implementation of calloc() that doesn't have a length check. An attacker could pass in memory objects larger than the buffer and wrap around to have a smaller buffer than required, allowing the attacker access to the other parts of the heap. We recommend upgrading the Google Cloud IoT Device SDK for Embedded C used to 1.0.3 or greater.",
