Currently, it\nonly does this for two of the cases, but there are two more that aren't\nhandled.\n\nFix this by moving the handling to a common place and jumping to it from\nall four places.  This is in preference to inserting a wrapper around\nnetfs_prepare_read_iterator() as proposed by Dmitry Antipov[1].","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ee4cdf7ba857a894ad1650d6ab77669cbbfa329e"},{"fixed":"88ecdfea1b333de5c51442b45cd549eeadf01852"},{"fixed":"105549d09a539a876b7c3330ab52d8aceedad358"}]}],"versions":["v6.11","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-57928.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-57928.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/105549d09a539a876b7c3330ab52d8aceedad358"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/88ecdfea1b333de5c51442b45cd549eeadf01852"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/57xxx/CVE-2024-57928.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-57928"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/57xxx/CVE-2024-57928.json"}}
