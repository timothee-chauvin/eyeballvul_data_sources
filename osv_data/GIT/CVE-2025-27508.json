{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-27508","published":"2025-03-05T21:32:42.470Z","modified":"2025-12-05T08:53:50.868323Z","aliases":["GHSA-hw43-fcmm-3m5g"],"summary":"Emissary Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm","details":"Emissary is a P2P based data-driven workflow engine. The ChecksumCalculator class within allows for hashing and checksum generation, but it includes or defaults to algorithms that are no longer recommended for secure cryptographic use cases (e.g., SHA-1, CRC32, and SSDEEP). These algorithms, while possibly valid for certain non-security-critical tasks, can expose users to security risks if used in scenarios where strong cryptographic guarantees are required. This issue is fixed in 8.24.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nationalsecurityagency/emissary","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"878c9d6cefd820fac04c7fc2991fc53f3b79b8bb"}]}],"versions":["5.0.0","5.1.0","5.10.0","5.11.0","5.2.0","5.3.0","5.4.1","5.5.0","5.6.0","5.7.0","5.8.0","5.9.0","6.0.0","6.1.0","6.2.0","6.3.0","6.4.0","6.5.0","6.6.0","7.0.0","7.1.0","7.10.0","7.11.0","7.12.0","7.13.0","7.14.0","7.15.0","7.16.0","7.17.0","7.18.0","7.19.0","7.2.0","7.3.0","7.4.0","7.5.0","7.6.0","7.7.0","7.8.0","7.9.0","emissary-7.19.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27508.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/27xxx/CVE-2025-27508.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/commit/da3a81a8977577597ff2a944820a5ae4e9762368"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/security/advisories/GHSA-hw43-fcmm-3m5g"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27508"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-327"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/27xxx/CVE-2025-27508.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
