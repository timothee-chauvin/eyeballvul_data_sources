{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-49360","published":"2024-11-29T18:11:58.261Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:30:47.039299Z","aliases":["GHSA-4chj-3c28-gvmp"],"summary":"Path traversal in Sandboxie","details":"Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. An authenticated user (**UserA**) with no privileges is authorized to read all files created in sandbox belonging to other users in the sandbox folders `C:\\Sandbox\\UserB\\xxx`. An authenticated attacker who can use `explorer.exe` or `cmd.exe` outside any sandbox can read other users' files in `C:\\Sandbox\\xxx`. By default in Windows 7+, the `C:\\Users\\UserA` folder is not readable by **UserB**.\nAll files edited or created during the sandbox processing are affected by the vulnerability. All files in C:\\Users are safe. If `UserB` runs a cmd in a sandbox, he will be able to access `C:\\Sandox\\UserA`. In addition, if **UserB** create a folder `C:\\Sandbox\\UserA` with malicious ACLs, when **UserA** will user the sandbox, Sandboxie doesn't reset ACLs ! This issue has not yet been fixed. Users are advised to limit access to their systems using Sandboxie.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/sandboxie","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"cbb1e23366674105ebcbc769a9a0f9743b047cd1"}]}],"versions":["0.5.5","0.6.0","0.6.5","0.6.7","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.7.3","0.7.4","0.7.5","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.8.2","0.8.5","0.8.6","0.8.7","0.8.7b","0.8.8","0.9.0a","0.9.1","0.9.2","0.9.3","0.9.4","0.9.5","0.9.6","0.9.7","0.9.7b","0.9.7c","0.9.7d","0.9.7e","0.9.8","0.9.8b","0.9.8c","0.9.8d","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.10","1.0.11","1.0.12","1.0.13","1.0.14","1.0.15","1.0.16","1.0.17","1.0.18","1.0.19","1.0.2","1.0.20","1.0.21","1.0.22","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.5.1","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","1.0.9","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.3.4","v0.1","v0.2","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.3","v0.3.5","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3a","v0.5.3b","v0.5.4","v0.5.4b","v0.5.4c","v0.5.4d","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.10.5","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.11.4","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.12.3","v1.12.4","v1.12.5","v1.12.6","v1.12.7","v1.12.8","v1.12.9","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.13.3","v1.13.4","v1.13.5","v1.13.6","v1.13.7","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.14.2","v1.14.3","v1.14.4","v1.14.5","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.2.9","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.5","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.1a","v1.6.1b","v1.6.2","v1.6.2b","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.2a","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v1.9.6","v1.9.7","v1.9.8","v5.40","v5.40.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-49360.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/security/advisories/GHSA-4chj-3c28-gvmp"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
