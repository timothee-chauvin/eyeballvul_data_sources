In versions prior to 2.0.6, a specially crafted Brotli-compressed envelope can cause Bugsink to spend excessive CPU time in decompression, leading to denial of service. This can be done if the DSN is known, which it is in many common setups (JavaScript, Mobile Apps). The issue is patched in Bugsink 2.0.6. The vulnerability is similar to, but distinct from, another brotli-related problem in Bugsink, GHSA-fc2v-vcwj-269v/CVE-2025-64508.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bugsink/bugsink","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"473d4de6d2de72a3bdee2905f540ce1afb67ce16"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.6"}]}}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.1.10","0.1.11","0.1.12","0.1.13","0.1.14","0.1.15","0.1.16","0.1.17","0.1.18","0.1.19","0.1.2","0.1.20","0.1.3","0.1.4","0.1.5","0.1.6","0.1.7","0.1.8","0.1.9","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.4","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.7.0","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.7.3","1.7.5","1.7.6","2.0.0","2.0.0a1","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64509.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64509.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bugsink/bugsink/security/advisories/GHSA-rrx3-2x4g-mq2h"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64509"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64509.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
