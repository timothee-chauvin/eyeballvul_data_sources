In versions prior to 12.3.0 the Nextcloud Android Talk application did not properly detect the lockscreen state when a call was incoming. If an attacker got physical access to the locked phone, and the victim received a phone call the attacker could gain access to the chat messages and files of the user. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Android Talk App is upgraded to 12.3.0.
