Nextcloud server versions 25.0.9, 26.0.4, and 27.0.1 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 19.0.13.10, 20.0.14.15, 21.0.9.13, 22.2.10.14, 23.0.12.9, 24.0.12.5, 25.0.9, 26.0.4, and 27.0.1 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable app files_external. This also makes the external storage inaccessible but retains the configurations until a patched version has been deployed.",
