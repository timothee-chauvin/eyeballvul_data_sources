A malicious binary defining `bclass` (part of RzBinInfo) is executed if `rclass` (part of RzBinInfo) is set to `fs`; the vulnerability can be exploited by any bin format where `bclass` and `rclass` are user defined. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.7.4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f1af5c8d9e99f4c6adc07a7b2623d19cb8850ab3"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.7.0","v0.7.2","v0.7.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-53256.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/53xxx/CVE-2024-53256.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/be24ca8879ed9c58f288bdf21c271b6294720da4/librz/main/rizin.c#L1275-L1278"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/commit/db6c5b39c065ce719f587c9815c47fbb834b10fa"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/security/advisories/GHSA-5jhc-frm4-p8v9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53256"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-78"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/53xxx/CVE-2024-53256.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
