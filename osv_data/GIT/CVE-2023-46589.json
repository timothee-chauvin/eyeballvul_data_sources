A trailer header that exceeded the header size limit could cause Tomcat to treat a single \nrequest as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request \nsmuggling when behind a reverse proxy.\n\n\nOlder, EOL versions may also be affected.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M11\u00a0onwards, 10.1.16 onwards, 9.0.83 onwards or 8.5.96 onwards, which fix the issue.",
