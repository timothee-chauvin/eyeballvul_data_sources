Prier to 1.4.2, there is a missing bounds check in Crypto_Key_update() (crypto_key_mgmt.c) which allows a remote attacker to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow by supplying a TLV packet with a spoofed length field. The function calculates the number of keys from an attacker-controlled field (pdu_len), which may exceed the static array size (kblk[98]), leading to an out-of-bounds write and potential memory corruption. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nasa/cryptolib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"309c1c4a57313044215ca730abfa3fbe9e5feed0"}]}],"versions":["v0.1-engineering-release","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64096.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-w6c3-pxvr-6m6j"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-121"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
