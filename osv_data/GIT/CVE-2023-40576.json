Affected versions are subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Read in the `RleDecompress` function. This Out-Of-Bounds Read occurs because FreeRDP processes the `pbSrcBuffer` variable without checking if it contains data of sufficient length. Insufficient data in the `pbSrcBuffer` variable may cause errors or crashes. This issue has been addressed in version 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freerdp/freerdp","events":[{"introduced":"f468a06d88c55b9ed484757326a9528cf27d33f4"},{"fixed":"59a5726ab36338776539192cae2563951d0ce94b"}]}],"versions":["3.0.0-beta1","3.0.0-beta2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-40576.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/blob/5be5553e0da72178a4b94cc1ffbdace9ceb153e5/libfreerdp/codec/include/bitmap.c#L94-L113"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/security/advisories/GHSA-x3x5-r7jm-5pq2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-16"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-125"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
