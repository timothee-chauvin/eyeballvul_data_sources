When datasource query caching is enabled, Grafana caches all headers, including `grafana_session`. As a result, any user that queries a datasource where the caching is enabled can acquire another userâ€™s session. To mitigate the vulnerability you can disable datasource query caching for all datasources. This issue has been patched in versions 9.2.10 and 9.3.4.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana","events":[{"introduced":"63cb359220be5027f89f80065a127098e3b7604c"},{"fixed":"414304eb7abf60795207e028ecc830d0bd4febd4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-23498.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-2j8f-6whh-frc8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230309-0007/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
