(N°4)","details":"MDC is a tool to take regular Markdown and write documents interacting deeply with a Vue component. Prior to version 0.17.2, a remote script-inclusion / stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in @nuxtjs/mdc lets a Markdown author inject a `<base href=\"https://attacker.tld\">` element. The `<base>` tag rewrites how all subsequent relative URLs are resolved, so an attacker can make the page load scripts, styles, or images from an external, attacker-controlled origin and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the site’s context. Version 0.17.2 contains a fix for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nuxt-modules/mdc","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a69242835d10733cfa8a9149dd74c47ea75b92df"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.17.2"}]}}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.13.3","v0.13.4","v0.13.5","v0.14.0","v0.15.0","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.8","v0.2.9","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54075.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nuxt-content/mdc","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3657a5bf2326a73cd3d906f57149146a412b962a"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.13.3","v0.13.4","v0.13.5","v0.14.0","v0.15.0","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.8","v0.2.9","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54075.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nuxt-modules/mdc/commit/3657a5bf2326a73cd3d906f57149146a412b962a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nuxt-modules/mdc/security/advisories/GHSA-cj6r-rrr9-fg82"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
