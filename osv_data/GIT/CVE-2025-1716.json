An attacker could craft a malicious model that uses Pickle to pull in a malicious PyPI package (hosted, for example, on pypi.org or GitHub) via `pip.main()`. Because pip is not a restricted global, the model, when scanned with picklescan, would pass security checks and appear to be safe, when it could instead prove to be problematic.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mmaitre314/picklescan","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"78ce704227c51f070c0c5fb4b466d92c62a7aa3d"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.10","v0.0.11","v0.0.12","v0.0.13","v0.0.14","v0.0.15","v0.0.17","v0.0.18","v0.0.19","v0.0.2","v0.0.20","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9","v0.016"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-1716.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/mmaitre314/picklescan/security/advisories/GHSA-655q-fx9r-782v"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.sonatype.com/security-advisories/cve-2025-1716"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mmaitre314/picklescan/commit/78ce704227c51f070c0c5fb4b466d92c62a7aa3d"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
