This is a problem, however, as there's a gap\nbetween the two phases in which a packet may come into rxrpc_encap_rcv()\nfrom the UDP packet but we oops when trying to wake the not-yet created I/O\nthread.\n\nAs a quick fix, just make rxrpc_encap_rcv() discard the packet if there's\nno I/O thread yet.\n\nA better, but more intrusive fix would perhaps be to rearrange things such\nthat the socket creation is done by the I/O thread.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a275da62e8c111b897b9cb73eb91df2f4e475ca5"},{"fixed":"cdf4bbbdb956d7426f687f38757ebca2a2759a0f"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a275da62e8c111b897b9cb73eb91df2f4e475ca5"},{"fixed":"56e415202b8a17de6496f4023e545fcb66f118ec"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a275da62e8c111b897b9cb73eb91df2f4e475ca5"},{"fixed":"c64f5fc95e9612fdf75587c8e21e494e614c18e2"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a275da62e8c111b897b9cb73eb91df2f4e475ca5"},{"fixed":"bc212465326e8587325f520a052346f0b57360e6"}]}],"versions":["v6.1","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.10.1","v6.10.10","v6.10.11","v6.10.12","v6.10.13","v6.10.2","v6.10.3","v6.10.4","v6.10.5","v6.10.6","v6.10.7","v6.10.8","v6.10.9","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.11.1","v6.11.2","v6.12-rc1","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.5","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-49864.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.55"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.10.14"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.11.0"},{"fixed":"6.11.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-49864.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/56e415202b8a17de6496f4023e545fcb66f118ec"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bc212465326e8587325f520a052346f0b57360e6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c64f5fc95e9612fdf75587c8e21e494e614c18e2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cdf4bbbdb956d7426f687f38757ebca2a2759a0f"}]}
