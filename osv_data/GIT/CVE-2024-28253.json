{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-28253","published":"2024-03-15T19:55:39.720Z","modified":"2025-12-05T04:17:10.909001Z","aliases":["GHSA-7vf4-x5m2-r6gr"],"summary":"SpEL Injection in `PUT /api/v1/policies` in OpenMetadata","details":"OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage, and seamless team collaboration. `CompiledRule::validateExpression` is also called from `PolicyRepository.prepare`. `prepare()` is called from `EntityRepository.prepareInternal()` which, in turn, gets called from `EntityResource.createOrUpdate()`. Note that even though there is an authorization check (`authorizer.authorize()`), it gets called after `prepareInternal()` gets called and therefore after the SpEL expression has been evaluated. In order to reach this method, an attacker can send a PUT request to `/api/v1/policies` which gets handled by `PolicyResource.createOrUpdate()`. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection (Spring) query and is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-252`. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution and has been addressed in version 1.3.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/open-metadata/openmetadata","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5a2075c6a4eec1e48a43b75c29c6384e66f29f90"}]}],"versions":["0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.pre2","0.3.1-release","0.4.0-pre","0.8.1-release","1.0.0-alpha-release"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-28253.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-spel-expression-injection"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/28xxx/CVE-2024-28253.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/b6b337e09a05101506a5faba4b45d370cc3c9fc8/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/jdbi3/EntityRepository.java#L693"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/b6b337e09a05101506a5faba4b45d370cc3c9fc8/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/resources/EntityResource.java#L219"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/b6b337e09a05101506a5faba4b45d370cc3c9fc8/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/resources/policies/PolicyResource.java#L365"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/jdbi3/PolicyRepository.java#L113"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/security/advisories/GHSA-7vf4-x5m2-r6gr"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28253"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-94"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/28xxx/CVE-2024-28253.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
