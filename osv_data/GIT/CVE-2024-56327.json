All details of GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w are relevant to `pyrage` for the versions specified in this advisory. See GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w for full details. Versions of `pyrage` before 1.2.0 lack plugin support and are therefore **not affected**. An equivalent issue was fixed in [the reference Go implementation of age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age), see advisory GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.3 and all users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/filosottile/age","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bbe6ce5eeb1bb70cfc705d0961c943f0dd637ffd"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.0-beta1","v1.0.0-beta2","v1.0.0-beta3","v1.0.0-beta4","v1.0.0-beta5","v1.0.0-beta6","v1.0.0-beta7","v1.0.0-rc.1","v1.0.0-rc.2","v1.0.0-rc.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc.1","v1.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-56327.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/woodruffw/pyrage","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ec398c4a38a1d2e184458c96153df89e606b0ba5"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.1-rc.1","v0.1.1-rc.2","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.1-rc.1","v1.0.1-rc.2","v1.0.1-rc.3","v1.0.1-rc.4","v1.0.1-rc.5","v1.0.1-rc.6","v1.0.1-rc.7","v1.0.2","v1.0.2-rc.1","v1.0.2-rc.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.3-rc.1","v1.0.3-rc.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3-rc.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-56327.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/security/advisories/GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/woodruffw/pyrage/security/advisories/GHSA-47h8-jmp3-9f28"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
