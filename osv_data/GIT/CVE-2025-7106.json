{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-7106","published":"2025-09-23T10:15:34.947Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:38:52.888102Z","details":"danny-avila/librechat is affected by an authorization bypass vulnerability due to improper access control checks. The `checkAccess` function in `api/server/middleware/roles/access.js` uses `permissions.some()` to validate permissions, which incorrectly grants access if only one of multiple required permissions is present. This allows users with the 'USER' role to create agents despite having `CREATE: false` permission, as the check for `['USE', 'CREATE']` passes with just `USE: true`. This vulnerability affects other permission checks as well, such as `PROMPTS`. The issue is present in all versions prior to the fix.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/danny-avila/librechat","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"91a2df47599c09d80886bfc28e0ccf1debd42110"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.3","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.4.8","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.5.7","v0.5.8","v0.5.9","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.10","v0.6.5","v0.6.6","v0.6.9","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.3-rc","v0.7.3-rc2","v0.7.4","v0.7.4-rc1","v0.7.5","v0.7.5-rc1","v0.7.5-rc2","v0.7.6","v0.7.6-rc1","v0.7.7","v0.7.7-rc1","v0.7.8","v0.7.8-rc1","v0.7.9-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-7106.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/7de2765b-d1fe-4495-9144-220070857c48"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/danny-avila/librechat/commit/91a2df47599c09d80886bfc28e0ccf1debd42110"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
