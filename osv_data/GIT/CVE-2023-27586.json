Prior to version 2.7.0, Cairo can send requests to external hosts when processing SVG files. A malicious actor could send a specially crafted SVG file that allows them to perform a server-side request forgery or denial of service. Version 2.7.0 disables CairoSVG's ability to access other files online by default.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kozea/cairosvg","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"33007d4af9195e2bfb2ff9af064c4c2d8e4b2b53"}]}],"versions":["0.1","0.1.1","0.1.2","0.2","0.3","0.3.1","0.4","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.4.3","0.4.4","0.5","1.0","1.0.1","1.0.10","1.0.11","1.0.12","1.0.13","1.0.14","1.0.15","1.0.16","1.0.17","1.0.18","1.0.19","1.0.2","1.0.20","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","1.0.9","2.0.0","2.0.0-rc6","2.0.0rc1","2.0.0rc2","2.0.0rc3","2.0.0rc4","2.0.0rc5","2.0.0rc6","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-27586.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/security/advisories/GHSA-rwmf-w63j-p7gv"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/commit/12d31c653c0254fa9d9853f66b04ea46e7397255"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/commit/33007d4af9195e2bfb2ff9af064c4c2d8e4b2b53"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/releases/tag/2.7.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20","CWE-918"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L"}]}
