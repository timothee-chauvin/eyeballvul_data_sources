Translating the\nbelow lockdep splat, CPU1 #6 will wait on CPU0 #1, CPU0 #8 will wait on\nCPU2 #3, and CPU2 #7 will wait on CPU1 #4 (if there's a writer, due to the\nfairness of r/w semaphores).\n\n    CPU0                     CPU1                     CPU2\n1   lock(&kvm->slots_lock);\n2                                                     lock(&vcpu->mutex);\n3                                                     lock(&kvm->srcu);\n4                            lock(cpu_hotplug_lock);\n5                            lock(kvm_lock);\n6                            lock(&kvm->slots_lock);\n7                                                     lock(cpu_hotplug_lock);\n8   sync(&kvm->srcu);\n\nNote, there are likely more potential deadlocks in KVM x86, e.g. the same\npattern of taking cpu_hotplug_lock outside of kvm_lock likely exists with\n__kvmclock_cpufreq_notifier():\n\n  cpuhp_cpufreq_online()\n  |\n  -> cpufreq_online()\n     |\n     -> cpufreq_gov_performance_limits()\n        |\n        -> __cpufreq_driver_target()\n           |\n           -> __target_index()\n              |\n              -> cpufreq_freq_transition_begin()\n                 |\n                 -> cpufreq_notify_transition()\n                    |\n                    -> ... __kvmclock_cpufreq_notifier()\n\nBut, actually triggering such deadlocks is beyond rare due to the\ncombination of dependencies and timings involved.  E.g. the cpufreq\nnotifier is only used on older CPUs without a constant TSC, mucking with\nthe NX hugepage mitigation while VMs are running is very uncommon, and\ndoing so while also onlining/offlining a CPU (necessary to generate\ncontention on cpu_hotplug_lock) would be even more unusual.\n\nThe most robust solution to the general cpu_hotplug_lock issue is likely\nto switch vm_list to be an RCU-protected list, e.g. so that x86's cpufreq\nnotifier doesn't to take kvm_lock.  For now, settle for fixing the most\nblatant deadlock, as switching to an RCU-protected list is a much more\ninvolved change, but add a comment in locking.rst to call out that care\nneeds to be taken when walking holding kvm_lock and walking vm_list.\n\n  ======================================================\n  WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected\n  6.10.0-smp--c257535a0c9d-pip
