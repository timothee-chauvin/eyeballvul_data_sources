{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-29488","published":"2021-05-07T15:15:07Z","modified":"2025-10-21T06:06:01.609091Z","related":["GHSA-jwj3-wrvf-v3rp"],"details":"SABnzbd is an open source binary newsreader. A vulnerability was discovered in SABnzbd that could trick the `filesystem.renamer()` function into writing downloaded files outside the configured Download Folder via malicious PAR2 files. A patch was released as part of SABnzbd 3.2.1RC1. As a workaround, limit downloads to NZBs without PAR2 files, deny write permissions to the SABnzbd process outside areas it must access to perform its job, or update to a fixed version.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"008794089866a0fa5fd39818806d34e9d0d8098d"}]}],"versions":["0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.2","0.6.3","0.6.4","0.6.5","0.6.6","0.6.7","0.6.8","0.6.8RC1","0.6.9","0.6.9RC1","0.6.9RC2","0.7.0","0.7.0Alpha1","0.7.0Alpha2","0.7.0Alpha3","0.7.0Beta1","0.7.0Beta2","0.7.0Beta3","0.7.0Beta4","0.7.0Beta5","0.7.0Beta6","0.7.0Beta7","0.7.0Beta8","0.7.0RC1","0.7.0RC2","0.7.1","0.7.10","0.7.10RC1","0.7.11","0.7.11RC1","0.7.11RC2","0.7.1RC1","0.7.1RC2","0.7.1RC3","0.7.1RC4","0.7.1RC5","0.7.2","0.7.2RC1","0.7.2RC2","0.7.3","0.7.3Beta1","0.7.3Beta2","0.7.3RC1","0.7.4","0.7.4Beta1","0.7.4Beta2","0.7.4Beta3","0.7.4RC1","0.7.4RC2","0.7.5","0.7.5RC1","0.7.6","0.7.6Beta1","0.7.6Beta2","0.7.6Final","0.7.7","0.7.8","0.7.8RC1","0.7.9","0.7.9RC1","0.8.0Alpha1","0.8.0Alpha2","0.8.0Beta1","0.8.0Beta2","0.8.0Beta3","0.8.0Beta4","0.8.0Beta5","0.8.0Beta6","1.0.0","1.0.0RC1","1.0.0RC2","1.0.0RC3","1.0.0RC4","1.0.0RC5","1.0.1","1.0.1RC1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.1.0","1.1.0Beta1","1.1.0RC1","1.1.0RC2","1.1.0RC3","1.1.0RC4","1.2.0","1.2.0Beta1","1.2.0RC1","1.2.1","1.2.1Beta1","1.2.1RC1","1.2.2","1.2.3","2.0.0","2.0.0Alpha1","2.0.0Beta1","2.0.0RC1","2.0.0RC2","2.0.0RC3","2.0.1","2.0.1RC1","2.0.1RC2","2.1.0","2.1.0Beta1","2.1.0RC1","2.2.0","2.2.0Alpha1","2.2.0Alpha2","2.2.0Alpha3","2.2.0Beta1","2.2.0Beta2","2.2.0RC1","2.2.0RC2","2.2.0RC3","2.2.1","2.2.1RC1","2.2.1RC2","2.3.0","2.3.0Alpha1","2.3.0Alpha2","2.3.0RC1","2.3.0RC2","2.3.1","2.3.1Beta1","2.3.1RC1","2.3.1RC2","2.3.2","2.3.2RC1","2.3.2RC2","2.3.3","2.3.3Beta1","2.3.3RC1","2.3.3RC2","2.3.4","2.3.4RC1","2.3.5","2.3.5RC1","2.3.5RC2","2.3.6","2.3.6Beta1","2.3.6RC1","2.3.7","2.3.7Beta1","2.3.7RC1","2.3.8","2.3.8Beta1","2.3.8RC1","2.3.9","2.3.9RC1","2.3.9RC2","3.0.0Alpha1","3.0.0Alpha2","3.0.0Beta1","3.0.0Beta2","3.0.0Beta3","3.0.0Beta4","3.0.0RC1","3.0.0RC2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-29488.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/security/advisories/GHSA-jwj3-wrvf-v3rp"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
