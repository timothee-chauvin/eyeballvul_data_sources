Debugging the issues shows that the JITed\nimage missing a jirl instruction at the end of the epilogue.\n\nThere are two passes in JIT compiling, the first pass set the flags and\nthe second pass generates JIT code based on those flags. With BPF progs\nmixing bpf2bpf and tailcalls, build_prologue() generates N insns in the\nfirst pass and then generates N+1 insns in the second pass. This makes\nepilogue_offset off by one and we will jump to some unexpected insn and\ncause lockup.
