{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-47771","published":"2025-06-19T23:41:41.357Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:17:23.506065Z","aliases":["GHSA-f5cx-h789-j959"],"summary":"PowSyBl Core allows deserialization of untrusted SparseMatrix data","details":"PowSyBl (Power System Blocks) is a framework to build power system oriented software. In versions 6.3.0 to 6.7.1, there is a deserialization issue in the read method of the SparseMatrix class that can lead to a wide range of privilege escalations depending on the circumstances. This method takes in an InputStream and returns a SparseMatrix object. This issue has been patched in com.powsybl:powsybl-math: 6.7.2. A workaround for this issue involves not using SparseMatrix deserialization (SparseMatrix.read(...) methods).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-core","events":[{"introduced":"a2f1f99612dcece3d50f8f8c4a488e5951363e0a"},{"fixed":"4fa8b7d8b7138489b8904bfa4620eae0d74378e7"}]}],"versions":["v6.3.0","v6.4.0-RC1","v6.5.0-RC1","v6.6.0-RC1","v6.7.0","v6.7.0-RC1","v6.7.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-47771.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/47xxx/CVE-2025-47771.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-core/commit/8ed16ce41683c4aef5f6aa1dd5ae8642aa5ed2bd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-core/releases/tag/v6.7.2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-core/security/advisories/GHSA-f5cx-h789-j959"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47771"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/47xxx/CVE-2025-47771.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
