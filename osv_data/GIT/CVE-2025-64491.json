Versions 7.14.7 and below allow unauthenticated reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Successful exploitation could lead to full account takeover, for example by altering the login form to send credentials to an attacker-controlled server. As a reflected XSS issue, exploitation requires the victim to open a crafted malicious link, which can be delivered via phishing, social media, or other communication channels. This issue is fixed in version 7.14.8.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/suitecrm/suitecrm","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"40da2845a170832a4e9e9fa0ebe731f8c34de42d"}]}],"versions":["7.2.2","7.9.15","7.9.6","v.7.9.11","v7.0.1","v7.0.2","v7.1","v7.1.1","v7.1.2","v7.1.3","v7.1.4","v7.1.5","v7.10-RC","v7.10-RC-2","v7.10-beta","v7.10-beta-2","v7.10-beta-3","v7.10.0","v7.10.1","v7.10.10","v7.10.11","v7.10.12","v7.10.13","v7.10.14","v7.10.15","v7.10.16","v7.10.17","v7.10.18","v7.10.19","v7.10.2","v7.10.20","v7.10.21","v7.10.22","v7.10.23","v7.10.3","v7.10.4","v7.10.5","v7.10.6","v7.10.7","v7.10.8","v7.10.9","v7.11-beta","v7.11-rc","v7.11-rc-2","v7.11.0","v7.11.1","v7.11.10","v7.11.11","v7.11.12","v7.11.13","v7.11.14","v7.11.15","v7.11.16","v7.11.17","v7.11.18","v7.11.19","v7.11.2","v7.11.20","v7.11.21","v7.11.22","v7.11.3","v7.11.4","v7.11.5","v7.11.6","v7.11.7","v7.11.8","v7.11.9","v7.12-rc","v7.12.0","v7.12.1","v7.12.10","v7.12.11","v7.12.12","v7.12.2","v7.12.3","v7.12.4","v7.12.5","v7.12.6","v7.12.7","v7.12.8","v7.12.9","v7.13.0","v7.13.0-beta","v7.13.1","v7.13.2","v7.13.3","v7.13.4","v7.14.0","v7.14.0-beta","v7.14.1","v7.14.2","v7.14.3","v7.14.4","v7.14.5","v7.14.6","v7.14.7","v7.1RC","v7.1RC2","v7.1beta","v7.1beta2","v7.2","v7.2.1","v7.2.2","v7.2.3","v7.2.4","v7.2beta","v7.2beta2","v7.2beta3","v7.3","v7.3-beta","v7.3.1","v7.3.2","v7.3beta3","v7.4","v7.4-beta","v7.4-beta.2","v7.4.1","v7.4.2","v7.4.3","v7.5-beta","v7.5-beta.2","v7.5-rc","v7.5.1","v7.5.2","v7.5.3","v7.6","v7.6-beta-1","v7.6-beta.2","v7.6-rc","v7.6.1","v7.6.2","v7.6.3","v7.6.4","v7.6.5","v7.6.6","v7.7","v7.7-beta1","v7.7-beta2","v7.7-rc","v7.7-rc2","v7.7.1","v7.7.2","v7.7.3","v7.7.4","v7.7.5","v7.7.6","v7.7.7","v7.7.8","v7.7.9","v7.8.0","v7.8.0-beta","v7.8.0-beta.2","v7.8.0-rc","v7.8.1","v7.8.10","v7.8.11","v7.8.12","v7.8.13","v7.8.14","v7.8.15","v7.8.16","v7.8.17","v7.8.18","v7.8.19","v7.8.2","v7.8.20","v7.8.3","v7.8.4","v7.8.5","v7.8.6","v7.8.7","v7.8.8","v7.8.9","v7.9.0","v7.9.0-beta","v7.9.0-rc","v7.9.1","v7.9.10","v7.9.11","v7.9.12","v7.9.13","v7.9.14","v7.9.16","v7.9.17","v7.9.2","v7.9.3","v7.9.4","v7.9.5","v7.9.7","v7.9.8","v7.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64491.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64491.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/SuiteCRM/SuiteCRM/commit/40da2845a170832a4e9e9fa0ebe731f8c34de42d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/SuiteCRM/SuiteCRM/security/advisories/GHSA-prfm-6667-x3mv"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64491"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64491.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
