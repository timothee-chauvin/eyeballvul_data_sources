An issue in versions 1.4.0 to 1.5.1 allows for exposure of the home directory on Unix systems when using Bash with the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions from the _shescape_ API with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. Other tested shells, Dash and Zsh, are not affected. Depending on how the output of _shescape_ is used, directory traversal may be possible in the application using _shescape_. The issue was patched in version 1.5.1. As a workaround, manually escape all instances of the tilde character (`~`) using `arg.replace(/~/g, \"\\\\~\")`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape","events":[{"introduced":"8e0d66f7d69d12c96dce8fc9c539b7d9390dc425"},{"fixed":"542532a64e24ea85044259345451010ca0cce71e"}]}],"versions":["v1.4.0","v1.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24725.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/24xxx/CVE-2022-24725.json"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/issues/169"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/170"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/security/advisories/GHSA-446w-rrm4-r47f"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24725"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/24xxx/CVE-2022-24725.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
