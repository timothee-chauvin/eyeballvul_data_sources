The problem is encoutered\nwith tests added by commit 38608ee7b690 (\"bpf, tests: Add load store\ntest case for tail call\")\n\nThis happens because tail call is done to a BPF prog with a different\nstack_depth. At the time being, the stack is kept as is when the caller\ntail calls its callee. But at exit, the callee restores the stack based\non its own properties. Therefore here, at each run, r1 is erroneously\nincreased by 32 - 16 = 16 bytes.\n\nThis was done that way in order to pass the tail call count from caller\nto callee through the stack. As powerpc32 doesn't have a red zone in\nthe stack, it was necessary the maintain the stack as is for the tail\ncall. But it was not anticipated that the BPF frame size could be\ndifferent.\n\nLet's take a new approach. Use register r4 to carry the tail call count\nduring the tail call, and save it into the stack at function entry if\nrequired. This means the input parameter must be in r3, which is more\ncorrect as it is a 32 bits parameter, then tail call better match with\nnormal BPF function entry, the down side being that we move that input\nparameter back and forth between r3 and r4. That can be optimised later.\n\nDoing that also has the advantage of maximising the common parts between\ntail calls and a normal function exit.\n\nWith the fix, tail call tests are now successfull:\n\n  test_bpf: #0 Tail call leaf jited:1 53 PASS\n  test_bpf: #1 Tail call 2 jited:1 115 PASS\n  test_bpf: #2 Tail call 3 jited:1 154 PASS\n  test_bpf: #3 Tail call 4 jited:1 165 PASS\n  test_bpf: #4 Tail call load/store leaf jited:1 101 PASS\n  test_bpf: #5 Tail call load/store jited:1 141 PASS\n  test_bpf: #6 Tail call error path, max count reached jited:1 994 PASS\n  test_bpf: #7 Tail call count preserved across function calls jited:1 140975 PASS\n  test_bpf: #8 Tail call error path, NULL target jited:1 110 PASS\n  test_bpf: #9 Tail call error path, index out of range jited:1 69 PASS\n  test_bpf: test_tail_calls: Summary: 10 PASSED, 0 FAILED, [10/10 JIT'ed]","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"51c66ad849a703d9bbfd7704c941827aed0fd9fd"},{"fixed":"747a6e547240baaaf41874d27333b87b87cfd24c"},{"fixed":"89d21e259a94f7d5582ec675aa445f5a79f347e4"}]}],"versions":["v5.12","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.10","v6.0.11","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.0.6","v6.0.7","v6.0.8","v6.0.9","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-48998.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.12"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-48998.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/747a6e547240baaaf41874d27333b87b87cfd24c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/89d21e259a94f7d5582ec675aa445f5a79f347e4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/48xxx/CVE-2022-48998.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48998"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/48xxx/CVE-2022-48998.json"}}
