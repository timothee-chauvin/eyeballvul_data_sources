In the WASMI Interpreter, an Out-of-bounds Buffer Write will arise if the host calls or resumes a Wasm function with more parameters than the default limit (128), as it will surpass the stack value. This doesnâ€™t affect calls from Wasm to Wasm, only from host to Wasm. This vulnerability was patched in version 0.31.1.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi","events":[{"introduced":"944a88a471efc2c9d805442852d07d188a10ada8"},{"fixed":"f7b3200e9f3dc9e2cbca966cb255c228453c792f"}]}],"versions":["v0.15.0","v0.16.0","v0.17.0","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.19.0","v0.20.0","v0.21.0","v0.22.0","v0.23.0","v0.24.0","v0.25.0","v0.26.0","v0.26.1","v0.27.0","v0.28.0","v0.28.0-wasi","v0.29.0","v0.30.0","v0.31.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-28123.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi/security/advisories/GHSA-75jp-vq8x-h4cq"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi/commit/f7b3200e9f3dc9e2cbca966cb255c228453c792f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi/releases/tag/v0.31.1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-787"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
