{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-5548","published":"2024-06-27T18:15:20Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:36:45Z","details":"A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the stitionai/devika repository, specifically within the /api/download-project endpoint. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the 'project_name' parameter in a GET request to download arbitrary files from the system. This issue affects the latest version of the repository. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient input validation in the 'download_project' function, allowing attackers to traverse the directory structure and access files outside the intended directory. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/stitionai/devika","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6acce21fb08c3d1123ef05df6a33912bf0ee77c2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-5548.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/ad7dd135-8839-4042-87c0-105af61d262c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/stitionai/devika/commit/6acce21fb08c3d1123ef05df6a33912bf0ee77c2"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
