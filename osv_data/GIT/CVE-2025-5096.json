{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-5096","published":"2025-05-23T09:15:21Z","modified":"2025-11-07T00:30:44.324170Z","details":"The TablePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'data-caption', 'data-s-content-padding', 'data-s-title', and 'data-footer' data-attributes in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/datatables/datatablessrc","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d278ed307035cb8740d2fad86b7cbb995380f7bb"},{"fixed":"d558328106bef2d48dfc4cf78581dd106f5c1077"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1","1.10.0","1.10.0-beta.1","1.10.0-beta.2","1.10.0-rc.1","1.10.1","1.10.10","1.10.11","1.10.12","1.10.13","1.10.14","1.10.15","1.10.16","1.10.17","1.10.18","1.10.19","1.10.2","1.10.20","1.10.21","1.10.22","1.10.23","1.10.24","1.10.25","1.10.3","1.10.4","1.10.5","1.10.6","1.10.7","1.10.8","1.10.9","1.11.0","1.11.1","1.11.2","1.11.3","1.11.4","1.11.5","1.12.0","1.12.1","1.13.0","1.13.1","1.13.2","1.13.3","1.13.4","1.13.5","1.13.6","1.13.7","1.13.8","1.7.0","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.0.8","2.1.0","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.1.7","2.1.8","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.3.0","2.3.1","ct_101.0.10","ct_101.0.11","ct_101.0.12","ct_101.0.13","ct_101.0.14","ct_101.0.15","ct_101.0.16","ct_101.0.17","ct_101.0.18","ct_101.0.19","ct_101.0.2","ct_101.0.20","ct_101.0.21","ct_101.0.22","ct_101.0.23","ct_101.0.24","ct_101.0.25","ct_101.0.26","ct_101.0.27","ct_101.0.3","ct_101.0.4","ct_101.0.5","ct_101.0.6","ct_101.0.7","ct_101.0.8","ct_101.0.9","temp_101.0.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-5096.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tablepress/tablepress","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b5e48379c8bbe9f5dc646dc3ff4c40f167cebe44"}]}],"versions":["0.4-alpha","0.5-alpha","0.6-beta","0.7-beta","0.8-beta","0.9-RC","1.0","1.1","1.1.1","1.10","1.11","1.12","1.13","1.14","1.2","1.3","1.4","1.5","1.5.1","1.6","1.6.1","1.7","1.8","1.8.1","1.9","1.9.1","1.9.2","2.0","2.0-RC1","2.0-RC2","2.0-RC3","2.0-beta1","2.0-beta2","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.1","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.1.7","2.1.8","2.2","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.2.3","2.2.4","2.2.5","2.3","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.4","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","3.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.1","3.1.1","3.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-5096.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://tablepress.org/release-announcement-tablepress-3-1-3/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/cd2dfa02-0404-4300-a5ed-6326f9df6d30?source=cve"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DataTables/DataTablesSrc/commit/d278ed307035cb8740d2fad86b7cbb995380f7bb"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DataTables/DataTablesSrc/commit/d558328106bef2d48dfc4cf78581dd106f5c1077"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3298453/tablepress"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://datatables.net/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/DataTables/DataTablesSrc/blob/29539c40504365bc4be0599e4b0739cf270a2e09/js/core/core.constructor.js#L329"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tablepress/tags/3.1.2/js/jquery.datatables.min.js"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://wordpress.org/plugins/tablepress/#developers"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
