{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-50881","published":"2025-12-30T12:23:20.343Z","modified":"2025-12-30T22:18:24.508209Z","summary":"wifi: ath9k: Fix use-after-free in ath9k_hif_usb_disconnect()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath9k: Fix use-after-free in ath9k_hif_usb_disconnect()\n\nThis patch fixes a use-after-free in ath9k that occurs in\nath9k_hif_usb_disconnect() when ath9k_destroy_wmi() is trying to access\n'drv_priv' that has already been freed by ieee80211_free_hw(), called by\nath9k_htc_hw_deinit(). The patch moves ath9k_destroy_wmi() before\nieee80211_free_hw(). Note that urbs from the driver should be killed\nbefore freeing 'wmi' with ath9k_destroy_wmi() as their callbacks will\naccess 'wmi'.\n\nFound by a modified version of
