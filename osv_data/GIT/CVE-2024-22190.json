There is an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-40590. On Windows, GitPython uses an untrusted search path if it uses a shell to run `git`, as well as when it runs `bash.exe` to interpret hooks. If either of those features are used on Windows, a malicious `git.exe` or `bash.exe` may be run from an untrusted repository. This issue has been patched in version 3.1.41.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gitpython-developers/gitpython","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f28873828496a6632b3a99101e3582ad164e9bb9"}]}],"versions":["0.1.4","0.1.4-pre","0.1.5","0.1.6","0.2.0-beta1","0.3.0-beta1","0.3.0-beta2","0.3.1-beta1","0.3.1-beta2","0.3.2","0.3.2-RC1","0.3.2.1","0.3.3","0.3.4","0.3.5","0.3.6","0.3.7","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.0.8","2.0.9","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.10","2.1.11","2.1.12","2.1.13","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.1.7","2.1.8","2.1.9","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","3.0.8","3.0.9","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.1.10","3.1.11","3.1.12","3.1.13","3.1.14","3.1.15","3.1.16","3.1.17","3.1.18","3.1.19","3.1.2","3.1.20","3.1.22","3.1.23","3.1.24","3.1.25","3.1.26","3.1.27","3.1.28","3.1.29","3.1.3","3.1.30","3.1.31","3.1.32","3.1.33","3.1.34","3.1.35","3.1.36","3.1.37","3.1.38","3.1.4","3.1.40","3.1.5","3.1.6","3.1.7","3.1.8","3.1.9","winerr_show"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-22190.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/GHSA-2mqj-m65w-jghx"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/commit/ef3192cc414f2fd9978908454f6fd95243784c7f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1792"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-426"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
