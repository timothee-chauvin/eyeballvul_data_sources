Prior to version 1.5.6, an attacker can cause a denial of service attack by passing in a malicious JWE Token with a high compression ratio. When the server processes this token, it will consume a lot of memory and processing time. Version 1.5.6 fixes this vulnerability by limiting the maximum token length.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/latchset/jwcrypto","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ecde4efdc7c9364b53bd1b4232e97557d821abdf"}]}],"versions":["0.5.0","untagged-23c3bb2e13ea18af9c56","untagged-59ed3e1fb9835e30c994","v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.0.sig","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-28102.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/latchset/jwcrypto/security/advisories/GHSA-j857-7rvv-vj97"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/latchset/jwcrypto/commit/90477a3b6e73da69740e00b8161f53fea19b831f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/09/msg00026.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/denial-of-service-vulnerability-discovered-in-jwcrypto-cve-2024-28102-28103"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
