This flaw allows an attacker to publish a malicious image to a public registry. Once this image is downloaded by a potential victim, the vulnerability is triggered after a user runs the 'podman top' command. This action gives the attacker access to the host filesystem, leading to information disclosure or denial of service.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/containers/podman","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"84c8870ac236578c41713113fc09a29a5f727bdd"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.1","v0.10.1.1","v0.10.1.2","v0.10.1.3","v0.11.1","v0.11.1.1","v0.12.1","v0.12.1.1","v0.12.1.2","v0.2","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.2.1","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.8.5","v0.9.1","v0.9.1.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.2.1","v0.9.3","v0.9.3.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.6.0-rc2","v1.6.1","v1.6.1-rc1","v1.6.2","v1.6.2-rc1","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.7.0-rc2","v1.8.0","v1.8.0-rc1","v1.8.1","v1.8.1-rc1","v1.8.1-rc2","v1.8.1-rc3","v1.8.1-rc4","v1.8.2","v1.8.2-rc1","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-rc1","v1.9.0-rc2","v2.0.0-rc1","v2.0.0-rc2","v2.0.0-rc3","v2.0.0-rc4","v2.0.0-rc5","v2.0.0-rc6","v2.0.0-rc7","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-rc1","v2.1.0-rc2","v2.2.0-rc1","v2.2.0-rc2","v3.1.0-rc1","v3.2.0-rc1","v4.0.0-rc1","v4.0.0-rc2","v4.0.0-rc3","v4.0.0-rc4","v4.0.0-rc5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-1227.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/containers/psgo","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3145d6da8a3ca85636b1546e8d19e11118cd6f02"}]}],"versions":["v1.1","v1.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-1227.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DLUJZV3HBP56ADXU6QH2V7RNYUPMVBXQ/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2070368"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10941"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240628-0001/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
