{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-66412","published":"2025-12-01T22:35:59.211Z","modified":"2025-12-03T02:19:05.926708Z","aliases":["GHSA-v4hv-rgfq-gp49"],"summary":"Angular Stored XSS Vulnerability via SVG Animation, SVG URL and MathML Attributes","details":"Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications using TypeScript/JavaScript and other languages. Prior to 21.0.2, 20.3.15, and 19.2.17, A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Angular Template Compiler. It occurs because the compiler's internal security schema is incomplete, allowing attackers to bypass Angular's built-in security sanitization. Specifically, the schema fails to classify certain URL-holding attributes (e.g., those that could contain javascript: URLs) as requiring strict URL security, enabling the injection of malicious scripts. This vulnerability is fixed in 21.0.2, 20.3.15, and 19.2.17.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/angular/angular","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1c6b0704fb63d051fab8acff84d076abfbc4893a"}]}],"versions":["10.0.0-next.0","10.0.0-next.1","10.0.0-next.2","10.0.0-next.3","10.0.0-next.4","10.0.0-next.5","10.0.0-next.6","10.0.0-next.7","10.0.0-next.8","10.0.0-next.9","10.0.0-rc.0","10.1.0-next.0","10.1.0-next.1","10.1.0-next.2","10.1.0-next.3","10.1.0-next.4","10.1.0-next.5","10.1.0-next.6","10.1.0-next.7","10.1.0-next.8","10.1.0-rc.0","11.0.0-next.0","11.0.0-next.1","11.0.0-next.2","11.0.0-next.3","11.0.0-next.4","11.0.0-next.5","11.0.0-next.6","11.1.0-next.0","11.1.0-next.1","11.1.0-next.2","11.1.0-next.3","11.1.0-next.4","12.0.0-next.0","12.0.0-next.1","12.0.0-next.2","12.0.0-next.3","12.0.0-next.4","12.0.0-next.5","12.0.0-next.6","12.0.0-next.7","12.0.0-next.8","12.1.0","12.1.0-next.2","12.1.0-next.3","12.1.0-next.4","12.1.0-next.5","12.1.0-next.6","12.2.0-next.0","12.2.0-next.1","12.2.0-next.2","12.2.0-next.3","13.0.0-next.0","13.0.0-next.1","13.0.0-next.10","13.0.0-next.11","13.0.0-next.12","13.0.0-next.13","13.0.0-next.14","13.0.0-next.2","13.0.0-next.3","13.0.0-next.4","13.0.0-next.5","13.0.0-next.6","13.0.0-next.7","13.0.0-next.8","13.0.0-next.9","13.1.0-next.0","13.1.0-next.1","13.1.0-next.2","13.1.0-next.3","13.2.0-next.0","13.2.0-next.1","13.2.0-next.2","14.0.0-next.0","14.0.0-next.1","14.0.0-next.10","14.0.0-next.11","14.0.0-next.12","14.0.0-next.13","14.0.0-next.14","14.0.0-next.15","14.0.0-next.2","14.0.0-next.3","14.0.0-next.4","14.0.0-next.5","14.0.0-next.6","14.0.0-next.7","14.0.0-next.8","14.0.0-next.9","14.1.0-next.0","14.1.0-next.1","14.1.0-next.2","14.1.0-next.3","14.1.0-next.4","14.2.0-next.0","14.2.0-next.1","15.0.0-next.0","15.0.0-next.1","15.0.0-next.2","15.0.0-next.3","15.0.0-next.4","15.0.0-next.5","15.1.0-next.0","15.1.0-next.1","15.1.0-next.2","15.1.0-next.3","15.2.0-next.0","15.2.0-next.1","15.2.0-next.2","15.2.0-next.3","15.2.0-next.4","16.0.0-next.0","16.0.0-next.1","16.0.0-next.2","16.0.0-next.3","16.0.0-next.4","16.0.0-next.5","16.0.0-next.6","16.1.0-next.0","16.1.0-next.1","16.1.0-next.2","16.1.0-next.3","16.2.0-next.0","16.2.0-next.1","16.2.0-next.2","16.2.0-next.3","16.2.0-next.4","17.0.0-next.0","17.0.0-next.1","17.0.0-next.2","17.0.0-next.3","17.0.0-next.4","17.0.0-next.5","17.0.0-next.6","17.0.0-next.7","17.1.0-next.0","17.1.0-next.1","17.1.0-next.2","17.1.0-next.3","17.1.0-next.4","17.1.0-next.5","17.2.0-next.0","17.2.0-next.1","17.3.0-next.0","17.3.0-next.1","18.0.0-next.0","18.0.0-next.1","18.0.0-next.2","18.0.0-next.3","18.0.0-next.4","18.0.0-next.5","18.1.0-next.0","18.1.0-next.1","18.1.0-next.2","18.1.0-next.3","18.1.0-next.4","18.2.0-next.0","18.2.0-next.1","18.2.0-next.2","18.2.0-next.3","18.2.0-next.4","19.0.0-next.0","19.0.0-next.1","19.0.0-next.10","19.0.0-next.2","19.0.0-next.3","19.0.0-next.4","19.0.0-next.5","19.0.0-next.6","19.0.0-next.7","19.0.0-next.8","19.0.0-next.9","19.1.0-next.0","19.1.0-next.1","19.1.0-next.2","19.1.0-next.3","19.1.0-next.4","19.2.0-next.0","19.2.0-next.1","19.2.0-next.2","19.2.0-next.3","2.0.0","2.0.0-alpha.13","2.0.0-alpha.14","2.0.0-alpha.15","2.0.0-alpha.17","2.0.0-alpha.18","2.0.0-alpha.19","2.0.0-alpha.20","2.0.0-alpha.21","2.0.0-alpha.22","2.0.0-alpha.23","2.0.0-alpha.24","2.0.0-alpha.25","2.0.0-alpha.26","2.0.0-alpha.27","2.0.0-alpha.28","2.0.0-alpha.29","2.0.0-alpha.30","2.0.0-alpha.31","2.0.0-alpha.32","2.0.0-alpha.33","2.0.0-alpha.34","2.0.0-alpha.35","2.0.0-alpha.40","2.0.0-alpha.41","2.0.0-alpha.42","2.0.0-alpha.44","2.0.0-alpha.47","2.0.0-alpha.48","2.0.0-alpha.49","2.0.0-alpha.50","2.0.0-alpha.51","2.0.0-alpha.52","2.0.0-alpha.53","2.0.0-alpha.54","2.0.0-alpha.55","2.0.0-beta.0","2.0.0-beta.11","2.0.0-beta.12","2.0.0-beta.13","2.0.0-beta.14","2.0.0-beta.16","2.0.0-beta.17","2.0.0-beta.6","2.0.0-beta.7","2.0.0-beta.8","2.0.0-rc.0","2.0.0-rc.1","2.0.0-rc.2","2.0.0-rc.3","2.0.0-rc.4","2.0.0-rc.5","2.0.0-rc.6","2.0.0-rc.7","2.1.0","2.1.0-beta.0","2.1.0-rc.0","2.2.0","2.2.0-beta.0","2.2.0-beta.1","2.2.0-rc.0","2.3.0","2.3.0-beta.0","2.3.0-rc.0","2.4.0-marker","20.0.0-next.0","20.0.0-next.1","20.0.0-next.2","20.0.0-next.3","20.0.0-next.4","20.0.0-next.5","20.0.0-next.6","20.0.0-next.7","20.0.0-next.8","20.1.0-next.0","20.1.0-next.1","20.1.0-next.2","20.1.0-next.3","20.2.0-next.0","20.2.0-next.1","20.2.0-next.2","20.2.0-next.3","20.2.0-next.4","20.2.0-next.5","20.2.0-next.6","21.0.0-next.0","21.0.0-next.1","21.0.0-next.2","21.0.0-next.3","21.0.0-next.4","21.0.0-next.5","21.0.0-next.6","21.0.0-next.7","21.0.0-next.8","21.1.0-next.0","4.0.0","4.0.0-beta.0","4.0.0-beta.1","4.0.0-beta.2","4.0.0-beta.3","4.0.0-beta.5","4.0.0-beta.6","4.0.0-beta.7","4.0.0-beta.8","4.0.0-rc.1","4.0.0-rc.2","4.0.0-rc.3","4.0.0-rc.4","4.0.0-rc.5","4.0.0-rc.6","4.1.0","4.1.0-beta.0","4.1.0-beta.1","4.1.0-rc.0","4.2.0-beta.0","4.2.0-rc.0","4.2.0-rc.1","4.2.0-rc.2","4.2.1","4.3.0","4.3.0-beta.0","4.3.0-beta.1","4.3.0-rc.0","5.0.0-beta.0","5.0.0-beta.1","5.0.0-beta.2","5.
