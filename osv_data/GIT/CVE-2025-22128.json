This does no harm unless one of the functions\nrequesting the IRQ fails and attempt to free the IRQ.\n\nThis may end up with a warning from the IRQ core that is expecting the\naffinity hint to be cleared before freeing the IRQ:\n\nkernel/irq/manage.c:\n\n\t/* make sure affinity_hint is cleaned up */\n\tif (WARN_ON_ONCE(desc->affinity_hint))\n\t\tdesc->affinity_hint = NULL;\n\nSo to fix this issue, clear the IRQ affinity hint before calling\nath12k_pci_free_irq() in the error path. The affinity will be cleared once\nagain further down the error path due to code organization, but that does\nno harm.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a3012f206d07fa62b5c2e384cbc3a81a4dbba3c9"},{"fixed":"a69a594794fcad96d4cfce12aab6c5014a12b4c8"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a3012f206d07fa62b5c2e384cbc3a81a4dbba3c9"},{"fixed":"35b33ba76765ce9e72949d957f3cf1feafd2955c"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a3012f206d07fa62b5c2e384cbc3a81a4dbba3c9"},{"fixed":"b43b1e2c52db77c872bd60d30cdcc72c47df70c7"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.14.1","v6.6","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-22128.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.35"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.14.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-22128.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/35b33ba76765ce9e72949d957f3cf1feafd2955c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a69a594794fcad96d4cfce12aab6c5014a12b4c8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b43b1e2c52db77c872bd60d30cdcc72c47df70c7"}]}
