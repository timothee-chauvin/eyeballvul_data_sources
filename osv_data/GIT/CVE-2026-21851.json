{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-21851","published":"2026-01-07T23:15:50.677Z","modified":"2026-01-09T07:38:33.034939Z","aliases":["GHSA-9rg3-9pvr-6p27"],"details":"MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) is an AI toolkit for health care imaging. In versions up to and including 1.5.1, a Path Traversal (Zip Slip) vulnerability exists in MONAI's `_download_from_ngc_private()` function. The function uses `zipfile.ZipFile.extractall()` without path validation, while other similar download functions in the same codebase properly use the existing `safe_extract_member()` function.
