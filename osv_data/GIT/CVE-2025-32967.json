A logging oversight in versions prior to 7.0.3.4 allows password change events to go unrecorded on the client-side log viewer, preventing administrators from auditing critical actions. This weakens traceability and opens the system to undetectable misuse by insiders or attackers. Version 7.0.3.4 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openemr/openemr","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"fb33cbdacd6474911caaedd271d443ce41370d28"}]}],"versions":["v2_7_2","v2_7_2-rc1","v2_7_2-rc2","v2_7_3-rc1","v2_8_0","v2_8_1","v2_8_2","v2_8_3","v2_9_0","v3_0_0","v3_0_1","v7_0_3","v7_0_3_1","v7_0_3_2","v7_0_3_3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-32967.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/32xxx/CVE-2025-32967.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/openemr/openemr/security/advisories/GHSA-7qj6-jxfc-xw4v"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32967"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-778"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/32xxx/CVE-2025-32967.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
