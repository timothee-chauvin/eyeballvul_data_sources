This results in a modified liblzma library that can be used by any software linked against this library, intercepting and modifying the data interaction with this library.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.tukaani.org/xz.git","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2d7d862e3ffa8cec4fd3fdffcd84e984a17aa429"},{"last_affected":"fd1b975b7851e081ed6e5cf63df946cd5cbdbb94"}]}],"versions":["v4.42.2alpha","v4.999.3alpha","v4.999.5alpha","v4.999.7beta","v4.999.8beta","v4.999.9beta","v5.0.0","v5.1.0alpha","v5.1.1alpha","v5.1.2alpha","v5.1.3alpha","v5.1.4beta","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.3.1alpha","v5.3.2alpha","v5.3.3alpha","v5.3.4alpha","v5.3.5beta","v5.4.0","v5.5.0alpha","v5.5.1alpha","v5.5.2beta","v5.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-3094.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/10"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/12"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/30/12"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/30/27"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/30/36"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/30/5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/16/5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://ariadne.space/2024/04/02/the-xz-utils-backdoor-is-a-symptom-of-a-larger-problem/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39895344"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://research.swtch.com/xz-script"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://research.swtch.com/xz-timeline"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://twitter.com/debian/status/1774219194638409898"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://twitter.com/infosecb/status/1774595540233167206"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://twitter.com/infosecb/status/1774597228864139400"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/03/29/reported-supply-chain-compromise-affecting-xz-utils-data-compression-library-cve-2024-3094"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/29/malicious_backdoor_xz/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/vulnerabilities/cve-2024-3094"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-3094"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2272210"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/urgent-security-alert-fedora-41-and-rawhide-users"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/backdoor-found-in-widely-used-linux-utility-breaks-encrypted-ssh-connections/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2024-002/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://boehs.org/node/everything-i-know-about-the-xz-backdoor"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1068024"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugs.gentoo.org/928134"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1222124"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://discourse.nixos.org/t/cve-2024-3094-malicious-code-in-xz-5-6-0-and-5-6-1-tarballs/42405"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://gist.github.com/thesamesam/223949d5a074ebc3dce9ee78baad9e27"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rxwq-x6h5-x525"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/karcherm/xz-malware"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&id=782"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2024/msg00057.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-security/2024-March/000248.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://lwn.net/Articles/967180/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39865810"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://openssf.org/blog/2024/03/30/xz-backdoor-cve-2024-3094/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-3094"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-3094"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2024-3094"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240402-0001/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://tukaani.org/xz-backdoor/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://twitter.com/LetsDefendIO/status/1774804387417751958"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-3094"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/are-you-affected-by-the-backdoor-in-xz-utils"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.tenable.com/blog/frequently-asked-questions-cve-2024-3094-supply-chain-backdoor-in-xz-utils"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://xeiaso.net/notes/2024/xz-vuln/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39877267"},{"type":"PACKAGE
