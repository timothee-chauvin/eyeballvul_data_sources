There is no mechanism for the kernel to find and delete all\ncreated config-items. Instead, the configfs-tsm-report mechanism has an\nexpectation that tsm_unregister() can happen at any time and cause\nestablished config-item access to start failing.\n\nThat expectation is not fully satisfied. While tsm_report_read(),\ntsm_report_{is,is_bin}_visible(), and tsm_report_make_item() safely fail\nif tsm_ops have been unregistered, tsm_report_privlevel_store()\ntsm_report_provider_show() fail to check for ops registration. Add the\nmissing checks for tsm_ops having been removed.\n\nNow, in supporting the ability for tsm_unregister() to always succeed,\nit leaves the problem of what to do with lingering config-items. The\nexpectation is that the admin that arranges for the ->remove() (unbind)\nof the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver is also responsible for deletion of all\nopen config-items. Until that deletion happens, ->probe() (reload /\nbind) of the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver fails.\n\nThis allows for emergency shutdown / revocation of attestation\ninterfaces, and requires coordinated restart.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"70e6f7e2b98575621019aa40ac616be58ff984e0"},{"fixed":"015f04ac884a454d4d8aaa7b67758f047742b1cf"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"70e6f7e2b98575621019aa40ac616be58ff984e0"},{"fixed":"cefbafcbdef011d6ef9414902311afdfba3c33eb"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"70e6f7e2b98575621019aa40ac616be58ff984e0"},{"fixed":"fba4ceaa242d2bdf4c04b77bda41d32d02d3925d"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.15.1","v6.15.2","v6.15.3","v6.6","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38210.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.35"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.15.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38210.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/015f04ac884a454d4d8aaa7b67758f047742b1cf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cefbafcbdef011d6ef9414902311afdfba3c33eb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fba4ceaa242d2bdf4c04b77bda41d32d02d3925d"}]}
