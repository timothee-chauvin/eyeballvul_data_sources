The attacker can send a PFCP Session Establishment Request with \"internet\" as the PDI Network Instance. The first character is interpreted as a length value to be used in a memcpy call. The destination buffer is only 100 bytes long on the stack. Then, 'i' gets interpreted as 105 bytes to copy from the source buffer to the destination buffer.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs","events":[{"introduced":"e4476863f66b3681d37ac17b95e37059e9c53744"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.3.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.18","v2.0.22","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.1.7","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.6","v2.2.7","v2.2.8","v2.2.9","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.6","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.5","v2.4.7","v2.4.8","v2.4.9","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.6.3","v2.6.4","v2.6.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-41794.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/10/06/technical-advisory-open5gs-stack-buffer-overflow-during-pfcp-session-establishment-on-upf-cve-2021-41794"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
