{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53777","published":"2025-12-09T00:00:32.947Z","modified":"2025-12-09T03:33:57.434867Z","summary":"erofs: kill hooked chains to avoid loops on deduplicated compressed images","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nerofs: kill hooked chains to avoid loops on deduplicated compressed images\n\nAfter heavily stressing EROFS with several images which include a\nhand-crafted image of repeated patterns for more than 46 days, I found\ntwo chains could be linked with each other almost simultaneously and\nform a loop so that the entire loop won't be submitted.  As a\nconsequence, the corresponding file pages will remain locked forever.\n\nIt can be _only_ observed on data-deduplicated compressed images.\nFor example, consider two chains with five pclusters in total:\n\tChain 1:  2->3->4->5    -- The tail pcluster is 5;\n        Chain 2:  5->1->2       -- The tail pcluster is 2.\n\nChain 2 could link to Chain 1 with pcluster 5; and Chain 1 could link\nto Chain 2 at the same time with pcluster 2.\n\nSince hooked chains are all linked locklessly now, I have no idea how\nto simply avoid the race.  Instead, let's avoid hooked chains completely\nuntil I could work out a proper way to fix this and end users finally\ntell us that it's needed to add it back.\n\nActually, this optimization can be found with multi-threaded workloads\n(especially even more often on deduplicated compressed images), yet I'm\nnot sure about the overall system impacts of not having this compared\nwith implementation complexity.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"267f2492c8f71dac44399988b510f9bf6b074a51"},{"fixed":"d3b39ea24835ac03da1a30f93ae7c05d55a40191"},{"fixed":"b5b0d52f00e4bacb0ebdf47cd7016b0485fffad2"},{"fixed":"10c2b98a40d9044a3e97f4697ca6213bad7e19c2"},{"fixed":"967c28b23f6c89bb8eef6a046ea88afe0d7c1029"}]}],"versions":["v5.19","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.3.1","v6.3.10","v6.3.11","v6.3.12","v6.3.2","v6.3.3","v6.3.4","v6.3.5","v6.3.6","v6.3.7","v6.3.8","v6.3.9","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.4.1","v6.4.2","v6.4.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53777.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.39"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.3.13"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.4.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53777.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10c2b98a40d9044a3e97f4697ca6213bad7e19c2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/967c28b23f6c89bb8eef6a046ea88afe0d7c1029"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b5b0d52f00e4bacb0ebdf47cd7016b0485fffad2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d3b39ea24835ac03da1a30f93ae7c05d55a40191"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53777.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53777"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53777.json"}}
