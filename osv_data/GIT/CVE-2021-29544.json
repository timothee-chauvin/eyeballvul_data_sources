{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-29544","published":"2021-05-14T20:15:12.623Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:20:02.131367Z","aliases":["BIT-tensorflow-2021-29544","GHSA-6g85-3hm8-83f9","PYSEC-2021-181","PYSEC-2021-472","PYSEC-2021-670"],"related":["GHSA-6g85-3hm8-83f9"],"details":"TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad`. This is because the implementation does not validate the rank of the `input_*` tensors. In turn, this results in the tensors being passes as they are to `QuantizeAndDequantizePerChannelGradientImpl`. However, the `vec<T>` method, requires the rank to 1 and triggers a `CHECK` failure otherwise. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 as this is the only other affected version.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20431e9044cf2ad3c0323c34888b192f3289af6b"}]}],"versions":["0.12.0-rc0","0.12.0-rc1","0.12.1","0.5.0","0.6.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.0rc0","v0.11.0","v0.11.0rc0","v0.11.0rc1","v0.11.0rc2","v0.12.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0rc0","v0.9.0","v0.9.0rc0","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-alpha","v1.0.0-rc0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc0","v1.1.0-rc1","v1.1.0-rc2","v1.12.0","v1.12.0-rc0","v1.12.0-rc1","v1.12.0-rc2","v1.12.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc0","v1.2.0-rc1","v1.2.0-rc2","v1.3.0-rc0","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-rc0","v1.5.0-rc1","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc0","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.8.0","v1.8.0-rc0","v1.8.0-rc1","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-rc0","v1.9.0-rc1","v1.9.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-29544.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["176068773716387915431679173772228483723","195008316136258450943681231606746130387","95720392910609131018701593023343122866","3060895597940912716767874583125497482","182232495582687097407204052409773180322"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2021-29544-a2f93e61","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/20431e9044cf2ad3c0323c34888b192f3289af6b","target":{"file":"tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/95078c145b5a7a43ee046144005f733092756ab5/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L162-L163"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/95078c145b5a7a43ee046144005f733092756ab5/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.h#L295-L306"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/20431e9044cf2ad3c0323c34888b192f3289af6b"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-6g85-3hm8-83f9"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
