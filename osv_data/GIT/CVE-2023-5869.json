This issue exists due to an integer overflow during array modification where a remote user can trigger the overflow by providing specially crafted data. This enables the execution of arbitrary code on the target system, allowing users to write arbitrary bytes to memory and extensively read the server's memory.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git","events":[{"introduced":"19f20081df059fef87e14c8e953669bd173dd7f1"},{"fixed":"fd851f9e4a13d81cccc4ac5d6059d732c7518111"}]}],"versions":["REL_11_0","REL_11_1","REL_11_10","REL_11_11","REL_11_12","REL_11_13","REL_11_14","REL_11_15","REL_11_16","REL_11_17","REL_11_18","REL_11_19","REL_11_2","REL_11_20","REL_11_21","REL_11_3","REL_11_4","REL_11_5","REL_11_6","REL_11_7","REL_11_8","REL_11_9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-5869.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7545"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7579"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7580"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7581"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7616"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7656"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7666"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7667"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7694"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7695"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7714"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7770"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7771"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7772"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7778"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7783"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7784"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7785"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7786"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7788"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7789"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7790"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7878"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7883"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7884"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7885"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0304"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0332"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0337"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-5869"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-161-155-1410-1313-1217-and-1122-released-2749/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2023-5869/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240119-0003/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2247169"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00007.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
