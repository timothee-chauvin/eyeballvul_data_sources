Prior to version 0.6.13, if cert_policy is set to none (the default value), then pam_pkcs11 will only check if the user is capable of logging into the token. An attacker may create a different token with the user's public data (e.g. the user's certificate) and a PIN known to the attacker. If no signature with the private key is required, then the attacker may now login as user with that created token. The default to *not* check the private key's signature has been changed with commit commi6638576892b59a99389043c90a1e7dd4d783b921, so that all versions starting with pam_pkcs11-0.6.0 should be affected. As a workaround, in `pam_pkcs11.conf`, set at least `cert_policy = signature;`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opensc/pam_pkcs11","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b8dbe6370d36a6a11a466d5f0ee285804103e030"}]}],"versions":["pam_pkcs11-0.5.2","pam_pkcs11-0.6.10","pam_pkcs11-0.6.11","pam_pkcs11-0.6.12","pam_pkcs11-0.6.7","pam_pkcs11-0.6.8","pam_pkcs11-0.6.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-24032.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/commit/470263258d1ac59c5eade439c4d9caba0097e6e6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/commit/b665b287ff955bbbd9539252ff9f9e2754c3fb48"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/commit/d9530167966a77115db6e885d459382a2e52ee9e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/releases/tag/pam_pkcs11-0.6.13"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/security/advisories/GHSA-8r8p-7mgp-vf56"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/02/msg00021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2025-24032-detect-vulnerability-in-linux-pam-module"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2025-24032-mitigate-linux-pam-module-vulnerability"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L"}]}
