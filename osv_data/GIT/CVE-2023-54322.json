default","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: set __exception_irq_entry with __irq_entry as a default\n\nfilter_irq_stacks() is supposed to cut entries which are related irq entries\nfrom its call stack.\nAnd in_irqentry_text() which is called by filter_irq_stacks()\nuses __irqentry_text_start/end symbol to find irq entries in callstack.\n\nBut it doesn't work correctly as without \"CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER\",\narm64 kernel doesn't include gic_handle_irq which is entry point of arm64 irq\nbetween __irqentry_text_start and __irqentry_text_end as we discussed in below link.\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/CACT4Y+aReMGLYua2rCLHgFpS9io5cZC04Q8GLs-uNmrn1ezxYQ@mail.gmail.com/#t\n\nThis problem can makes unintentional deep
