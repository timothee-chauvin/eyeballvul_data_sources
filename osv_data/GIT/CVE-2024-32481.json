Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper","events":[{"introduced":"036f153683e0d55b890305eb4c77680a0872fcba"},{"fixed":"6fb750af3972160f871f62bb49a44827acf06423"}]}],"versions":["v0.3.10","v0.3.10rc1","v0.3.10rc2","v0.3.10rc3","v0.3.10rc4","v0.3.10rc5","v0.3.8","v0.3.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-32481.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/9136169468f317a53b4e7448389aa315f90b95ba/vyper/codegen/stmt.py#L286-L287"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/3de1415ee77a9244eb04bdb695e249d3ec9ed868"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/5319cfbe14951e007ccdb323257e5ada869b35d5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-ppx5-q359-pvwj"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-681"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
