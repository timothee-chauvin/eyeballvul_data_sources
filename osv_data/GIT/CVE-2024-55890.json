{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-55890","published":"2024-12-13T18:00:04Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:44:43.893841Z","aliases":["GHSA-832w-fhmw-w4f4"],"summary":"D-Tale allows Remote Code Execution through the Custom Filter Input","details":"D-Tale is a visualizer for pandas data structures. Prior to version 3.16.1, users hosting D-Tale publicly can be vulnerable to remote code execution allowing attackers to run malicious code on the server. Users should upgrade to version 3.16.1 where the `update-settings` endpoint blocks the ability for users to update the `enable_custom_filters` flag. The only workaround for versions earlier than 3.16.1 is to only host D-Tale to trusted users.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/man-group/dtale","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1e26ed3ca12fe83812b90f12a2b3e5fb0b740f7a"}]}],"versions":["2.14.0","2.9.0","v.1.21.1","v.1.32.1","v.1.6.9","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.15.2","v1.16.0","v1.17.0","v1.18.0","v1.18.1","v1.18.2","v1.19.0","v1.19.1","v1.19.2","v1.2.0","v1.20.0","v1.21.0","v1.22.0","v1.22.1","v1.23.0","v1.24.0","v1.25.0","v1.26.0","v1.27.0","v1.28.0","v1.28.1","v1.29.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.30.0","v1.31.0","v1.32.0","v1.33.0","v1.33.1","v1.34.0","v1.35.0","v1.36.0","v1.37.1","v1.38.0","v1.39.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.40.1","v1.40.2","v1.41.0","v1.41.1","v1.42.0","v1.42.1","v1.43.0","v1.44.0","v1.44.1","v1.45.0","v1.46.0","v1.47.0","v1.48.0","v1.49.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.51.0","v1.52.0","v1.53.0","v1.54.0","v1.54.1","v1.55.0","v1.56.0","v1.58.1","v1.58.2","v1.59.1","v1.6.1","v1.6.10","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.60.1","v1.60.2","v1.61.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.11","v1.7.12","v1.7.13","v1.7.14","v1.7.15","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.7.5","v1.7.6","v1.7.7","v1.7.8","v1.7.9","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.10","v1.8.11","v1.8.12","v1.8.13","v1.8.14","v1.8.15","v1.8.16","v1.8.17","v1.8.19","v1.8.7","v1.8.8","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.2","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.12.0","v2.12.1","v2.12.2","v2.12.3","v2.13.0","v2.14.1","v2.14.2","v2.14.3","v2.14.4","v2.15.0","v2.15.1","v2.15.2","v2.16.0","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.5.1","v2.6.0","v2.7.1","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.9.1","v3.0.0","v3.1.0","v3.1.4","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.10.0","v3.11.0","v3.12.0","v3.13.0","v3.13.1","v3.14.0","v3.14.1","v3.15.1","v3.16.0","v3.2.0","v3.3.0","v3.4.0","v3.5.0","v3.6.0","v3.7.0","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-55890.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/man-group/dtale/security/advisories/GHSA-832w-fhmw-w4f4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/man-group/dtale/commit/1e26ed3ca12fe83812b90f12a2b3e5fb0b740f7a"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/man-group/dtale#custom-filter"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N"}]}
