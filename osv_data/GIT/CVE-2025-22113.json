However, while ltp running\nstress tests, it was observed that in case of some error handling paths, it is\npossible for update_super_work to start a transaction after the journal is\ndestroyed eg:\n\n(umount)\next4_kill_sb\n  kill_block_super\n    generic_shutdown_super\n      sync_filesystem /* commits all txns */\n      evict_inodes\n        /* might start a new txn */\n      ext4_put_super\n\tflush_work(&sbi->s_sb_upd_work) /* flush the workqueue */\n        jbd2_journal_destroy\n          journal_kill_thread\n            journal->j_flags |= JBD2_UNMOUNT;\n          jbd2_journal_commit_transaction\n            jbd2_journal_get_descriptor_buffer\n              jbd2_journal_bmap\n                ext4_journal_bmap\n                  ext4_map_blocks\n                    ...\n                    ext4_inode_error\n                      ext4_handle_error\n                        schedule_work(&sbi->s_sb_upd_work)\n\n                                               /* work queue kicks in */\n                                               update_super_work\n                                                 jbd2_journal_start\n                                                   start_this_handle\n                                                     BUG_ON(journal->j_flags &\n                                                            JBD2_UNMOUNT)\n\nHence, introduce a new mount flag to indicate journal is destroying and only do\na journaled (and deferred) update of sb if this flag is not set. Otherwise, just\nfallback to an un-journaled commit.\n\nFurther, in the journal destroy path, we have the following sequence:\n\n  1. Set mount flag indicating journal is destroying\n  2. force a commit and wait for it\n  3. flush pending sb updates\n\nThis sequence is important as it ensures that, after this point, there is no sb\nupdate that might be journaled so it is safe to update the sb outside the\njournal. (To avoid race discussed in 2d01ddc86606)\n\nAlso, we don't need a similar check in ext4_grp_locked_error since it is only\ncalled from mballoc and AFAICT it would be always valid to schedule work here.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"2d01ddc86606564fb08c56e3bc93a0693895f710"},{"fixed":"eddca44ddf810e27f0c96913aa3cc92ebd679ddb"},{"fixed":"db05767b5bc307143d99fe2afd8c43af58d2ebef"},{"fixed":"ce2f26e73783b4a7c46a86e3af5b5c8de0971790"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.14.1","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-22113.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.11.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.46"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.14.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-22113.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ce2f26e73783b4a7c46a86e3af5b5c8de0971790"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/db05767b5bc307143d99fe2afd8c43af58d2ebef"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eddca44ddf810e27f0c96913aa3cc92ebd679ddb"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/22xxx/CVE-2025-22113.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22113"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/22xxx/CVE-2025-22113.json"}}
