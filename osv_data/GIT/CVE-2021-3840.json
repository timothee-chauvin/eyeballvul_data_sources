MITRE classifies this weakness as an Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in which a private package dependency may be replaced by an unauthorized package of the same name published to a well-known public repository such as PyPi. The configuration has been updated to only install components built by Antilles, removing all other public package indexes. Additionally, the antilles-tools dependency has been published to PyPi.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lenovo/antilles","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4e48b59ef642afbfe9ee8f80dc202ec7cc7ab2b5"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-3840.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lenovo/Antilles/security/advisories/GHSA-hgc3-hp6x-wpgx"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
