Prior to 7.0.5 and 6.0.19, a small amount of HTTP/2 traffic can lead to Suricata using a large amount of memory. The issue has been addressed in Suricata 7.0.5 and 6.0.19. Workarounds include disabling the HTTP/2 parser and reducing `app-layer.protocols.http2.max-table-size` value (default is 65536).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata","events":[{"introduced":"21ec99aa76cc5406007ce12a4891f2eaedb02291"},{"last_affected":"d8bad3b1aa7ae1c3a19a348b1b881ca2dc5b68d0"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"7.0.0"},{"last_affected":"7.0.4"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata","events":[{"introduced":"5219691f45ab6c6fb3c3970550dd670c73dbcfa6"},{"last_affected":"7ac695ba26a95a7c4e3608a7c957ab488e3b1df8"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"last_affected":"6.0.18"}]}}],"versions":["suricata-6.0.0","suricata-6.0.1","suricata-6.0.10","suricata-6.0.11","suricata-6.0.12","suricata-6.0.13","suricata-6.0.14","suricata-6.0.15","suricata-6.0.16","suricata-6.0.17","suricata-6.0.18","suricata-6.0.2","suricata-6.0.3","suricata-6.0.4","suricata-6.0.5","suricata-6.0.6","suricata-6.0.7","suricata-6.0.8","suricata-6.0.9","suricata-7.0.0","suricata-7.0.1","suricata-7.0.2","suricata-7.0.3","suricata-7.0.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-32663.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/08d93f7c3762781b743f88f9fdc4389eb9c3eb64"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/c0af92295e833d1db29b184d63cd3b829451d7fd"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/d24b37a103c04bb2667e449e080ba4c8e56bb019"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/e68ec4b227d19498f364a41eb25d3182f0383ca5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-9jxm-qw9v-266r"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/03/msg00029.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/6892"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/6900"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400","CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
