By crafting a malicious PFS filesystem file, an attacker can get binwalk's PFS extractor to extract files at arbitrary locations when binwalk is run in extraction mode (-e option). Remote code execution can be achieved by building a PFS filesystem that, upon extraction, would extract a malicious binwalk module into the folder .config/binwalk/plugins.\n This vulnerability is associated with program files src/binwalk/plugins/unpfs.py.\n\nThis issue affects binwalk from 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/refirmlabs/binwalk","events":[{"introduced":"be738a52e09b0da2a6e21470e0dbcd5beb42ed1b"},{"fixed":"fa0c0bd59b8588814756942fe4cb5452e76c1dcd"}]}],"versions":["python27","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-4510.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/12/msg00022.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/pull/617"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-07"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
