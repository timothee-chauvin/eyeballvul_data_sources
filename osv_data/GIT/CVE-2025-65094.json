{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-65094","published":"2025-11-19T19:06:21.569Z","modified":"2025-12-17T05:46:05.328172Z","aliases":["GHSA-hmmw-4ccm-fx44"],"summary":"WBCE CMS is Vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Group ID Manipulation (IDOR)","details":"WBCE CMS is a content management system. Prior to version 1.6.4, a low-privileged user in WBCE CMS can escalate their privileges to the Administrators group by manipulating the groups[] parameter in the /admin/users/save.php request. The UI restricts users to assigning only their existing group, but server-side validation is missing, allowing attackers to overwrite their group membership and obtain full administrative access. This results in a complete compromise of the CMS. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wbce/wbce_cms","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"15be89e102f1da4ac935e1d2b6af1dafa962a787"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.0-beta.1","1.0.0-beta.2","1.0.0-beta.3","1.0.0-rc.1","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.10","1.1.11","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.1.6","1.1.8","1.1.9","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.4","1.6.0","1.6.0-beta.1","1.6.0-beta.2","1.6.0-beta.4","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65094.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/65xxx/CVE-2025-65094.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/WBCE/WBCE_CMS/commit/96046178f4c80cf16f7c224054dec7fdadddda7e"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/WBCE/WBCE_CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-hmmw-4ccm-fx44"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65094"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-266","CWE-285"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/65xxx/CVE-2025-65094.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
