{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-36076","published":"2022-09-02T12:30:14Z","modified":"2025-12-04T10:34:42.991765Z","aliases":["GHSA-xmgg-fx9p-prq6"],"summary":"Account takeover via SSO plugins in NodeBB","details":"NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version 1.17.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nodebb/nodebb","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b2652ae6972ef1a750e0764391638a6d15622dac"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1-auto.0","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.5.0-1","v0.5.0-2","v0.9.2","v1.0.0","v1.14.1-beta.0","v1.14.1-beta.1","v1.14.1-beta.2","v1.14.1-beta.3","v1.14.2-beta.0","v1.14.2-beta.1","v1.14.3-beta.0","v1.14.3-beta.1","v1.14.3-beta.10","v1.14.3-beta.11","v1.14.3-beta.12","v1.14.3-beta.13","v1.14.3-beta.14","v1.14.3-beta.15","v1.14.3-beta.16","v1.14.3-beta.2","v1.14.3-beta.3","v1.14.3-beta.4","v1.14.3-beta.5","v1.14.3-beta.6","v1.14.3-beta.7","v1.14.3-beta.8","v1.14.3-beta.9","v1.15.0","v1.15.0-beta.0","v1.15.0-beta.1","v1.15.0-beta.10","v1.15.0-beta.11","v1.15.0-beta.12","v1.15.0-beta.13","v1.15.0-beta.14","v1.15.0-beta.15","v1.15.0-beta.16","v1.15.0-beta.17","v1.15.0-beta.18","v1.15.0-beta.19","v1.15.0-beta.2","v1.15.0-beta.20","v1.15.0-beta.21","v1.15.0-beta.22","v1.15.0-beta.23","v1.15.0-beta.24","v1.15.0-beta.25","v1.15.0-beta.26","v1.15.0-beta.27","v1.15.0-beta.28","v1.15.0-beta.29","v1.15.0-beta.3","v1.15.0-beta.30","v1.15.0-beta.4","v1.15.0-beta.5","v1.15.0-beta.6","v1.15.0-beta.7","v1.15.0-beta.8","v1.15.0-beta.9","v1.15.0-rc.0","v1.15.0-rc.1","v1.15.0-rc.2","v1.15.0-rc.3","v1.15.0-rc.4","v1.15.0-rc.5","v1.15.1","v1.15.1-beta.0","v1.15.2-beta.0","v1.15.2-beta.1","v1.15.3-beta.0","v1.16.1-beta.0","v1.16.2-beta.0","v1.17.0","v1.17.0-beta.0","v1.17.0-beta.1","v1.17.0-beta.2","v1.17.0-beta.3","v1.17.0-beta.4","v1.17.0-beta.5","v1.17.1","v1.5.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-36076.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://blogs.opera.com/security/2022/03/bug-bounty-adventures-a-nodebb-0-day/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/36xxx/CVE-2022-36076.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/a2400f6baff44cb2996487bcd0cc6e2acc74b3d4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/security/advisories/GHSA-xmgg-fx9p-prq6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36076"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-352"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/36xxx/CVE-2022-36076.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
