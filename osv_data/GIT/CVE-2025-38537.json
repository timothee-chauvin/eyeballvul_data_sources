{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-38537","published":"2025-08-16T11:12:29Z","modified":"2025-10-22T14:55:33.201646Z","related":["SUSE-SU-2025:03301-1"],"summary":"net: phy: Don't register LEDs for genphy","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: Don't register LEDs for genphy\n\nIf a PHY has no driver, the genphy driver is probed/removed directly in\nphy_attach/detach. If the PHY's ofnode has an \"leds\" subnode, then the\nLEDs will be (un)registered when probing/removing the genphy driver.\nThis could occur if the leds are for a non-generic driver that isn't\nloaded for whatever reason. Synchronously removing the PHY device in\nphy_detach leads to the following deadlock:\n\nrtnl_lock()\nndo_close()\n    ...\n    phy_detach()\n        phy_remove()\n            phy_leds_unregister()\n                led_classdev_unregister()\n                    led_trigger_set()\n                        netdev_trigger_deactivate()\n                            unregister_netdevice_notifier()\n

deterministic.\n\nGeneric PHYs do not support LEDs anyway, so don't bother
