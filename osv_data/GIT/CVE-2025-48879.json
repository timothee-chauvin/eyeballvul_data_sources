The issue can be triggered by a broken multipart/form-data request lacking an end boundary to any of OctoPrint's endpoints implemented through the octoprint.server.util.tornado.UploadStorageFallbackHandler request handler. The request handler will get stuck in an endless busy loop, looking for a part of the request that will never come. As Tornado is single-threaded, that will effectively block the whole web server. The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.11.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/octoprint/octoprint","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c9c35c17bd820f19c6b12e6c0359fc0cfdd0c1ec"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48879.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/foosel/octoprint","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"96e48c5662274a1941486d3e0853141661fc0455"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48879.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/commit/c9c35c17bd820f19c6b12e6c0359fc0cfdd0c1ec"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/security/advisories/GHSA-9wj4-8h85-pgrw"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-140","CWE-835"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
