If the buffer\nsize was not a multiple of 8 then a read buffer overflow was possible.\n\nTherefore, create a new ibmvnic function that loops over a buffer and\ncalls hex_dump_to_buffer instead.\n\nThis patch address KASAN reports like the one below:\n  ibmvnic 30000003 env3: Login Buffer:\n  ibmvnic 30000003 env3: 01000000af000000\n  <...>\n  ibmvnic 30000003 env3:
