It was found from\nvmcore that perf had registered two ops with the same content\nsuccessively, both dynamic. After unregistering the second ops, a\nuse-after-free occurred.\n\nIn ftrace_shutdown(), when the second ops is unregistered, the\nFTRACE_UPDATE_CALLS command is not set because there is another enabled\nops with the same content.  Also, both ops are dynamic and the ftrace\ncallback function is ftrace_ops_list_func, so the\nFTRACE_UPDATE_TRACE_FUNC command will not be set. Eventually the value\nof 'command' will be 0 and ftrace_shutdown() will skip the rcu\nsynchronization.\n\nHowever, ftrace may be activated. When the ops is released, another CPU\nmay be accessing the ops.  Add the missing synchronization to fix this\nproblem.\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: use-after-free in __ftrace_ops_list_func kernel/trace/ftrace.c:7020 [inline]\nBUG: KASAN: use-after-free in
