In versions 0.5.6 and below, youki’s apparmor handling performs insufficiently strict write-target validation, and when combined with path substitution during pathname resolution, can allow writes to unintended procfs locations. While resolving a path component-by-component, a shared-mount race can substitute intermediate components and redirect the final target. This issue is fixed in version 0.5.7.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/youki-dev/youki","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bd54457ba9de1629f21fe678687f433aec63e7c7"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62596.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/youki-dev/youki/commit/5886c91073b9be748bd8d5aed49c4a820548030a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/youki-dev/youki/security/advisories/GHSA-vf95-55w6-qmrf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/pathrs-lite/procfs"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://youtu.be/tGseJW_uBB8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://youtu.be/y1PaBzxwRWQ"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-363","CWE-61"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H"}]}
