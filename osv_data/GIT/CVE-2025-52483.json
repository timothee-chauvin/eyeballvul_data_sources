Prior to version 1.9.5, if the clone URL returned by GitHub is malicious (or can be injected using upstream vulnerabilities) a shell script injection can occur within the `withpasswd` function. Alternatively, an argument injection is possible in the `gettreesha `function. either of these can then lead to a potential RCE. Users should upgrade immediately to v1.9.5 to receive a fix. All prior versions are vulnerable. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/juliaregistries/registrator.jl","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c65b0c8c0df714c865d333aa23de07faab3f3492"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.2.9","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52483.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/security/advisories/GHSA-589r-g8hf-xx59"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/pull/448"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-77"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
