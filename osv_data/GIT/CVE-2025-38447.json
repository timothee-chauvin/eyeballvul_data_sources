This patch fixes the\nout-of-bounds access by refactoring the logic into a new helper,\nfolio_unmap_pte_batch().\n\nThe new helper correctly calculates the safe batch size by capping the\nscan at both the VMA and PMD boundaries.  To simplify the code, it also\nsupports partial batching (i.e., any number of pages from 1 up to the\ncalculated safe maximum), as there is no strong reason to special-case\nfor fully mapped folios.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"354dffd29575cdf13154e8fb787322354aa9efc4"},{"fixed":"510fe9c15d07e765d96be9a9dc37e5057c6c09f4"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"354dffd29575cdf13154e8fb787322354aa9efc4"},{"fixed":"ddd05742b45b083975a0855ef6ebbf88cf1f532a"}]}],"versions":["v6.14","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.15.1","v6.15.2","v6.15.3","v6.15.4","v6.15.5","v6.15.6","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38447.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.15.0"},{"fixed":"6.15.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38447.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/510fe9c15d07e765d96be9a9dc37e5057c6c09f4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ddd05742b45b083975a0855ef6ebbf88cf1f532a"}]}
