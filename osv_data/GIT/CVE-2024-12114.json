{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-12114","published":"2025-03-08T06:15:35.103Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:23:18.026085Z","details":"The FooGallery – Responsive Photo Gallery, Image Viewer, Justified, Masonry & Carousel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.29 via the foogallery_attachment_modal_save AJAX action due to missing validation on a user controlled key (img_id). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with granted access and above, to update arbitrary post and page content. This requires the Gallery Creator Role setting to be a value lower than 'Editor' for there to be any real impact.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/fooplugins/foogallery","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d43c48b06b0b5094e13a45d18fc33c5af1190b88"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.10","1.2.11","1.2.12","1.2.13","1.2.14","1.2.15","1.2.16","1.2.17","1.2.18","1.2.20","1.2.4","1.2.6","1.2.7","1.2.8","1.2.9","1.3.6","1.3.7","1.4.12","1.4.14","1.4.15","1.4.17","1.4.24","1.4.25","1.4.26","1.4.27","1.4.28","1.4.29","1.4.30","1.4.31","1.4.32","1.4.33","1.4.34","1.4.50","1.4.8","1.5.8","1.5.9","1.6.0","1.6.11","1.6.14","1.6.17","1.6.7","1.7.4","1.7.8","1.8.0","1.8.11","1.8.12","1.8.18","1.8.20","1.8.8","1.9.11","1.9.23","1.9.25","1.9.28","1.9.30","1.9.34","1.9.35","1.9.39","1.9.45","1.9.47","1.9.48","1.9.49","1.9.51","1.9.52","1.9.53","1.9.8","2.0.24","2.0.30","2.0.35","2.0.39","2.1.18","2.1.28","2.2.14","2.2.15","2.2.16","2.2.20","2.2.26","2.2.28","2.2.35","2.2.41","2.2.44","2.4.13","2.4.14","2.4.15","2.4.16","2.4.22","2.4.26","2.4.27","2.4.29","2.4.6","2.4.7","2.4.9","ie10-justified-gallery-object-doesnt-support-action","v1.1.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-12114.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/fooplugins/foogallery/blob/master/includes/admin/class-gallery-attachment-modal.php#L242"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f4fe3ad9-247f-4e5d-8c79-0970afaa7729?source=cve"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3250684/foogallery/tags/2.4.30/includes/admin/class-gallery-attachment-modal.php?old=3229839&old_path=foogallery%2Ftags%2F2.4.29%2Fincludes%2Fadmin%2Fclass-gallery-attachment-modal.php"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
