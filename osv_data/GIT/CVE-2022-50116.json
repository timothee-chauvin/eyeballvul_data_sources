Furthermore, the data channels starve\nthe control channel on high transmission load on the ldisc.\n\nIntroduce an additional control channel data queue to prevent timeouts and\nlink hangups during ldisc congestion. This is being processed before the\nuser channel data queue in gsm_data_kick(), i.e. with the highest priority.\nPut the queue to ldisc data path into a workqueue and trigger it whenever\nnew data has been put into the transmission queue. Change\ngsm_dlci_data_sweep() accordingly to fill up the transmission queue until\nTX_THRESH_HI. This solves the locking issue, keeps latency low and provides\ngood performance on high data load.\nNote that now all packets from a DLCI are removed from the internal queue\nif the associated DLCI was closed. This ensures that no data is sent by the\nintroduced write task to an already closed DLCI.\n\nBUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0, test_v24_loop/124\n lock: serial8250_ports+0x3a8/0x7500, .magic:
