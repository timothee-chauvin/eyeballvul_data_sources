{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-36400","published":"2024-06-04T14:11:26Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:42:28.140108Z","aliases":["GHSA-2hfw-w739-p7x5","GHSA-9hc7-6w9r-wj94","RUSTSEC-2024-0343"],"summary":"nano-id is unable to generate the correct character set","details":"nano-id is a unique string ID generator for Rust. Affected versions of the nano-id crate incorrectly generated IDs using a reduced character set in the `nano_id::base62` and `nano_id::base58` functions. Specifically, the `base62` function used a character set of 32 symbols instead of the intended 62 symbols, and the `base58` function used a character set of 16 symbols instead of the intended 58 symbols. Additionally, the `nano_id::gen` macro is also affected when a custom character set that is not a power of 2 in size is specified. It should be noted that `nano_id::base64` is not affected by this vulnerability. This can result in a significant reduction in entropy, making the generated IDs predictable and vulnerable to brute-force attacks when the IDs are used in security-sensitive contexts such as session tokens or unique identifiers. The vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2209b317ae4ea4caa982a09b0a8e5c0621dd4f83"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.1","v0.3.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-36400.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id/security/advisories/GHSA-9hc7-6w9r-wj94"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id/commit/a9022772b2f1ce38929b5b81eccc670ac9d3ab23"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-331"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
