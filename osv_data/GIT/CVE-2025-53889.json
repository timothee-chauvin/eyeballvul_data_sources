{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-53889","published":"2025-07-14T23:50:23Z","modified":"2025-11-09T19:55:15.656229Z","aliases":["GHSA-7cvf-pxgp-42fc"],"summary":"Directus missing permission checks for manual trigger Flows","details":"Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.12.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, Directus Flows with a manual trigger are not validating whether the user triggering the Flow has permissions to the items provided as payload to the Flow. Depending on what the Flow is set up to do this can lead to the Flow executing potential tasks on the attacker's behalf without authenticating. Bad actors could execute the manual trigger Flows without authentication, or access rights to the said collection(s) or item(s). Users with manual trigger Flows configured are impacted as these endpoints do not currently validate if the user has read access to `directus_flows` or to the relevant collection/items. The manual trigger Flows should have tighter security requirements as compared to webhook Flows where users are expected to perform do their own checks. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. As a workaround, implement permission checks for read access to Flows and read access to relevant collection/items.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/directus/directus","events":[{"introduced":"4d63fba50a7cf199e89423365a515e99cecf4ebf"},{"fixed":"b8a47c621a5485855765e7f082722c1d98c3cc3f"}]}],"versions":["10.11.2","v10.0.0","v10.1.0","v10.1.1","v10.10.0","v10.10.1","v10.10.2","v10.10.3","v10.10.4","v10.10.5","v10.10.6","v10.10.7","v10.11.0","v10.11.1","v10.11.2","v10.12.1","v10.13.0","v10.13.1","v10.13.2","v10.2.0","v10.2.1","v10.3.0","v10.4.0","v10.4.2","v10.4.3","v10.5.0","v10.5.1","v10.5.2","v10.5.3","v10.6.0","v10.6.1","v10.6.2","v10.6.3","v10.6.4","v10.7.0","v10.7.1","v10.7.2","v10.8.0","v10.8.1","v10.8.2","v10.8.3","v10.9.0","v10.9.1","v10.9.2","v10.9.3","v11.0.0","v11.0.0-rc.1","v11.0.0-rc.2","v11.0.0-rc.3","v11.0.1","v11.0.2","v11.1.0","v11.1.1","v11.1.2","v11.2.0","v11.2.1","v11.2.2","v11.3.0","v11.3.1","v11.3.2","v11.3.3","v11.3.4","v11.3.5","v11.4.0","v11.4.1","v11.5.0","v11.5.1","v11.6.0","v11.6.1","v11.7.0","v11.7.1","v11.7.2","v11.8.0","v9.12.0","v9.12.1","v9.12.2","v9.13.0","v9.14.1","v9.14.2","v9.14.3","v9.14.4","v9.14.5","v9.15.0","v9.15.1","v9.16.0","v9.16.1","v9.17.0","v9.17.1","v9.17.2","v9.17.3","v9.17.4","v9.18.0","v9.18.1","v9.19.0","v9.19.1","v9.19.2","v9.20.0","v9.20.1","v9.20.2","v9.20.3","v9.20.4","v9.21.0","v9.21.1","v9.21.2","v9.22.0","v9.22.1","v9.22.2","v9.22.3","v9.22.4","v9.23.0","v9.23.1","v9.23.2","v9.23.3","v9.23.4","v9.24.0","v9.25.0","v9.25.1","v9.25.2","v9.26.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53889.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/22be460c76957708d67fdd52846a9ad1cbb083fb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/directus/directus/releases/tag/v11.9.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-7cvf-pxgp-42fc"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
