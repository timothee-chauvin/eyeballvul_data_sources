This can lead to XSS if an admin opens the post in the editor. Execution of this attack does require an authenticated user. This has been patched in WordPress 5.3.1, along with all the previous WordPress versions from 3.7 to 5.3 via a minor release. Automatic updates are enabled by default for minor releases and we strongly recommend that you keep them enabled.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"378daf04727d8124c3a98e2f801632e068c04964"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-16780.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress-develop","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"505dd6a20b6fc3d06130018c1caeff764248c29e"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-16780.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/commit/505dd6a20b6fc3d06130018c1caeff764248c29e"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/security/advisories/GHSA-x3wp-h3qx-9w94"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/738644"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2020/Jan/8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/12/wordpress-5-3-1-security-and-maintenance-release/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9976"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4599"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4677"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
