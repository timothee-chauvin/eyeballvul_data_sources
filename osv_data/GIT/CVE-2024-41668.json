{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-41668","published":"2024-07-23T18:14:41Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:28:27.949248Z","aliases":["GHSA-9h44-r3c3-q7rm"],"summary":"cBioPortal Proxy Endpoint Vulnerabliity","details":"The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics provides visualization, analysis, and download of large-scale cancer genomics data sets. When running a publicly exposed proxy endpoint without authentication, cBioPortal could allow someone to perform a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack. Logged in users could do the same on private instances. A fix has been released in version 6.0.12. As a workaround, one might be able to disable `/proxy` endpoint entirely via, for example, nginx.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cbioportal/cbioportal","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"608fca4d4c33ec473c5a847e57bf0394860c1dd4"}]}],"versions":["untagged-46e68095e194ee3ab21c","untagged-5c091fa4fd789aa79296","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.16.0","v1.16.1","v1.17.0","v1.17.1","v1.18.0","v1.18.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.10","v3.1.11","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.1.4","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.1.9","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.10","v3.2.11","v3.2.12","v3.2.13","v3.2.14","v3.2.15","v3.2.2","v3.2.3","v3.2.4","v3.2.5","v3.2.6","v3.2.7","v3.2.8","v3.2.9","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.3.4","v3.3.5","v3.3.6","v3.3.7","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.4.10","v3.4.11","v3.4.12","v3.4.13","v3.4.14","v3.4.15","v3.4.16","v3.4.17","v3.4.18","v3.4.19","v3.4.2","v3.4.20","v3.4.21","v3.4.22","v3.4.23","v3.4.3","v3.4.4","v3.4.5","v3.4.6","v3.4.7","v3.4.8","v3.4.9","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.5.3","v3.5.4","v3.5.5","v3.6.0","v3.6.1","v3.6.10","v3.6.11","v3.6.12","v3.6.13","v3.6.14","v3.6.15","v3.6.16","v3.6.17","v3.6.18","v3.6.19","v3.6.2","v3.6.20","v3.6.21","v3.6.22","v3.6.3","v3.6.4","v3.6.5","v3.6.6","v3.6.7","v3.6.8","v3.6.9","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.7.10","v3.7.11","v3.7.12","v3.7.13","v3.7.14","v3.7.15","v3.7.16","v3.7.17","v3.7.18","v3.7.19","v3.7.2","v3.7.20","v3.7.21","v3.7.22","v3.7.24","v3.7.25","v3.7.26","v3.7.27","v3.7.28","v3.7.29","v3.7.3","v3.7.30","v3.7.4","v3.7.5","v3.7.6","v3.7.7","v3.7.8","v3.7.9","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.10","v4.1.11","v4.1.13","v4.1.14","v4.1.15","v4.1.16","v4.1.17","v4.1.18","v4.1.19","v4.1.2","v4.1.3","v4.1.4","v4.1.5","v4.1.6","v4.1.7","v4.1.8","v4.1.9","v5.0.0","v5.0.1","v5.0.2","v5.1.0","v5.1.1","v5.1.10","v5.1.2","v5.1.3","v5.1.4","v5.1.5","v5.1.6","v5.1.7","v5.1.9","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.2.10","v5.2.11","v5.2.2","v5.2.3","v5.2.4","v5.2.5","v5.2.6","v5.2.7","v5.2.8","v5.2.9","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.10","v5.3.11","v5.3.12","v5.3.13","v5.3.14","v5.3.15","v5.3.16","v5.3.17","v5.3.18","v5.3.19","v5.3.2","v5.3.3","v5.3.4","v5.3.5","v5.3.6","v5.3.7","v5.3.8","v5.3.9","v5.4.0","v5.4.1","v5.4.10","v5.4.2","v5.4.3","v5.4.4","v5.4.5","v5.4.6","v5.4.7","v5.4.9","v6.0.0","v6.0.1","v6.0.10","v6.0.11","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.0.6","v6.0.7","v6.0.8","v6.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-41668.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/commit/ea8642fdbda2d61d2ab34b9da7a1594680bbbcd5"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/pull/10884"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/releases/tag/v6.0.12"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/security/advisories/GHSA-9h44-r3c3-q7rm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.wizlynxgroup.com/security-research-advisories/vuln/WLX-2024-004"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
