This causes to a crash when traffic is sent over the\nPKEY interface due to the parent having a single queue but the child\nhaving multiple queues.\n\nThis patch fixes the number of queues to 1 for legacy IPoIB at the\nearliest possible point in time.\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 000000000000036b\nPGD 0 P4D 0\nOops: 0000 [#1] SMP\nCPU: 4 PID: 209665 Comm: python3 Not tainted
