For Cilium users who use Gateway API for Ingress for some services and use LB-IPAM or BGP for LB Service implementation and use network policies to block egress traffic from workloads in a namespace to workloads in other namespaces, egress traffic from workloads covered by such network policies to LoadBalancers configured by `Gateway` resources will incorrectly be allowed. LoadBalancer resources not deployed via a Gateway API configuration are not affected by this issue. This issue affects: Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.14 inclusive, v1.16 between v1.16.0 and v1.16.7 inclusive, and v1.17 between v1.17.0 and v1.17.1 inclusive. This issue is fixed in Cilium v1.15.15, v1.16.8, and v1.17.2. A Clusterwide Cilium Network Policy can be used to work around this issue for users who are unable to upgrade.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium","events":[{"introduced":"82999990bc954699cf24853ef9747d9166ee24c8"},{"fixed":"dc65ba9bb5f8201e0f51babfb6e7a02de2527460"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.16.0"},{"fixed":"1.16.8"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium","events":[{"introduced":"c2bbf787eab9b7f728fcc861904d9bcf17e4ba9b"},{"fixed":"fb3ab54ffe3f1b5059e87a9022fd6559b276b7ce"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.17.0"},{"fixed":"1.17.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium","events":[{"introduced":"2db45c468981a863b230186ad37d44e5a7c08d61"},{"fixed":"dacf1b6b130757f7670b7c3b2f485deeb2b1fc97"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.15.0"},{"fixed":"1.15.15"}]}}],"versions":["1.15.0","1.15.1","1.15.10","1.15.11","1.15.12","1.15.13","1.15.14","1.15.2","1.15.3","1.15.4","1.15.5","1.15.6","1.15.7","1.15.8","1.15.9","1.16.0","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.16.6","1.16.7","1.17.0","1.17.1","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.15.10","v1.15.11","v1.15.12","v1.15.13","v1.15.14","v1.15.2","v1.15.3","v1.15.4","v1.15.5","v1.15.6","v1.15.7","v1.15.8","v1.15.9","v1.16.0","v1.16.1","v1.16.2","v1.16.3","v1.16.4","v1.16.5","v1.16.6","v1.16.7","v1.17.0","v1.17.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-30162.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/lb-ipam"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-24qp-4xx8-3jvj"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/cilium/proxy/pull/1172"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-863"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
