{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2019-18625","published":"2020-01-06T21:15:11Z","modified":"2025-10-21T04:56:23.473515Z","details":"An issue was discovered in Suricata 5.0.0. It was possible to bypass/evade any tcp based signature by faking a closed TCP session using an evil server. After the TCP SYN packet, it is possible to inject a RST ACK and a FIN ACK packet with a bad TCP Timestamp option. The client will ignore the RST ACK and the FIN ACK packets because of the bad TCP Timestamp option. Both linux and windows client are ignoring the injected packets.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9f0294fadca3dcc18c919424242a41e01f3e8318"},{"fixed":"ea0659de7640cf6a51de5bbd1dbbb0414e4623a0"}]}],"versions":["suricata-0.8.2","suricata-1.0.0","suricata-1.0.1","suricata-1.0.2","suricata-1.1","suricata-1.1beta1","suricata-1.1beta2","suricata-1.1beta3","suricata-1.1rc1","suricata-1.2","suricata-1.2.1","suricata-1.2beta1","suricata-1.2rc1","suricata-1.3","suricata-1.3.1","suricata-1.3beta1","suricata-1.3beta2","suricata-1.3rc1","suricata-1.4","suricata-1.4beta1","suricata-1.4beta2","suricata-1.4beta3","suricata-1.4rc1","suricata-2.0","suricata-2.0.1","suricata-2.0.1rc1","suricata-2.0.2","suricata-2.0beta1","suricata-2.0beta2","suricata-2.0rc1","suricata-2.0rc2","suricata-2.0rc3","suricata-2.1beta1","suricata-2.1beta2","suricata-2.1beta3","suricata-2.1beta4","suricata-3.0","suricata-3.0.1","suricata-3.0.1RC1","suricata-3.0RC1","suricata-3.0RC2","suricata-3.0RC3","suricata-3.1","suricata-3.1.1","suricata-3.1.2","suricata-3.1RC1","suricata-3.2","suricata-3.2.1","suricata-3.2RC1","suricata-3.2beta1","suricata-4.0.0","suricata-4.0.0-beta1","suricata-4.0.0-rc1","suricata-4.0.0-rc2","suricata-4.0.1","suricata-4.1.0","suricata-4.1.0-beta1","suricata-4.1.0-rc1","suricata-4.1.0-rc2","suricata-4.1.1","suricata-4.1.2","suricata-4.1.3","suricata-4.1.4","suricata-4.1.5","suricata-5.0.0","suricata-5.0.0-beta1","suricata-5.0.0-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-18625.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"77552925385301535484846638403075378889","length":9474},"id":"CVE-2019-18625-15879651","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata/commit/9f0294fadca3dcc18c919424242a41e01f3e8318","target":{"file":"src/stream-tcp.c","function":"StreamTcpPacketStateSynSent"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["238598271220304966856559466770965973485","279651488918883477699503650257993417274","169376049637888187050965633253352622761","215311576506261072220627462137581972598","339032724268722382633707803789191897350","153243547391008626281359707210397985577"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2019-18625-3d6a5d50","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata/commit/9f0294fadca3dcc18c919424242a41e01f3e8318","target":{"file":"src/stream-tcp.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"713767493228213847736411040913510400","length":8775},"id":"CVE-2019-18625-4b5037a9","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata/commit/ea0659de7640cf6a51de5bbd1dbbb0414e4623a0","target":{"file":"src/stream-tcp.c","function":"StreamTcpPacketStateSynSent"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["238598271220304966856559466770965973485","279651488918883477699503650257993417274","169376049637888187050965633253352622761","215311576506261072220627462137581972598","339032724268722382633707803789191897350","153243547391008626281359707210397985577"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2019-18625-9c2557e3","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata/commit/ea0659de7640cf6a51de5bbd1dbbb0414e4623a0","target":{"file":"src/stream-tcp.c"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/9f0294fadca3dcc18c919424242a41e01f3e8318"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/ea0659de7640cf6a51de5bbd1dbbb0414e4623a0"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/01/msg00032.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/3286"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/3395"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
