{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-64436","published":"2025-11-07T22:59:47.228Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:21:39.647317Z","aliases":["GHSA-7xgm-5prm-v5gc","GO-2025-4104"],"summary":"KubeVirt Excessive Role Permissions Could Enable Unauthorized VMI Migrations Between Nodes","details":"KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. In 1.5.0 and earlier, the permissions granted to the virt-handler service account, such as the ability to update VMI and patch nodes, could be abused to force a VMI migration to an attacker-controlled node. This vulnerability could otherwise allow an attacker to mark all nodes as unschedulable, potentially forcing the migration or creation of privileged pods onto a compromised node.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt","events":[{"introduced":"d53baa7f84687d156bd8a3a80d7ea2fbd8e0a993"}]}],"versions":["v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc.1","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64436.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64436.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/security/advisories/GHSA-7xgm-5prm-v5gc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64436"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-269","CWE-276"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/64xxx/CVE-2025-64436.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
