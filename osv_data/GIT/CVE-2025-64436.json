{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-64436","published":"2025-11-07T22:59:47Z","modified":"2025-11-12T02:45:18.622556Z","aliases":["GHSA-7xgm-5prm-v5gc"],"summary":"KubeVirt Excessive Role Permissions Could Enable Unauthorized VMI Migrations Between Nodes","details":"KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. In 1.5.0 and earlier, the permissions granted to the virt-handler service account, such as the ability to update VMI and patch nodes, could be abused to force a VMI migration to an attacker-controlled node. This vulnerability could otherwise allow an attacker to mark all nodes as unschedulable, potentially forcing the migration or creation of privileged pods onto a compromised node.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"522b44c0ce8d1909618324cb083d69e5c7a0a234"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.5.0"}]}}],"versions":["v0.0.1-alpha.0","v0.0.1-alpha.1","v0.0.1-alpha.2","v0.0.1-alpha.3","v0.0.1-alpha.4","v0.0.1-alpha.5","v0.0.1-alpha.6","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.1.0","v0.1.0-alpha","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.12.0","v0.12.0-alpha.0","v0.12.0-alpha.1","v0.12.0-alpha.2","v0.12.0-alpha.3","v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.15.0","v0.15.0-alpha.0","v0.16.0","v0.16.0-alpha.0","v0.17.0","v0.17.0-alpha.0","v0.17.0-alpha.1","v0.18.0","v0.19.0","v0.19.0-rc.0","v0.2.0","v0.20.0","v0.21.0","v0.22.0","v0.23.0","v0.24.0","v0.25.0","v0.25.0-rc.0","v0.26.0","v0.26.0-rc.0","v0.26.1","v0.27.0","v0.27.0-rc.0","v0.28.0","v0.28.0-rc.0","v0.28.0-rc.1","v0.28.0-rc.2","v0.29.0","v0.29.0-rc.0","v0.29.0-rc.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.0-alpha.0","v0.3.0-alpha.1","v0.3.0-alpha.2","v0.3.0-alpha.3","v0.3.0-alpha.4","v0.30.0","v0.30.0-rc.0","v0.30.0-rc.1","v0.30.0-rc.2","v0.30.0-rc.3","v0.30.0-rc.4","v0.31.0","v0.31.0-rc.1","v0.32.0-rc.1","v0.33.0-rc.0","v0.34.0-rc.0","v0.35.0","v0.35.0-rc.0","v0.36.0-rc.0","v0.37.0-rc.0","v0.38.0","v0.38.0-rc.0","v0.39.0-rc.0","v0.4.0","v0.4.0-alpha.0","v0.4.0-alpha.1","v0.4.0-alpha.2","v0.4.1","v0.4.1-alpha.1","v0.4.1-alpha.2","v0.40.0-rc.0","v0.41.0-rc.0","v0.42.0","v0.42.0-rc.0","v0.43.0-rc.0","v0.43.1-rc.1","v0.44.0","v0.44.0-rc.0","v0.45.0","v0.45.0-rc.0","v0.46.0","v0.46.0-rc.0","v0.47.0-rc.0","v0.48.0","v0.48.0-rc.0","v0.49.0","v0.49.0-rc.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.0-alpha.0","v0.5.0-alpha.1","v0.5.1-alpha.1","v0.5.1-alpha.2","v0.5.1-alpha.3","v0.50.0","v0.50.0-rc.0","v0.51.0","v0.51.0-rc.0","v0.52.0","v0.52.0-rc.0","v0.53.0","v0.53.0-rc.0","v0.54.0","v0.54.0-rc.0","v0.55.0","v0.55.0-rc.0","v0.56.0-rc.0","v0.57.0","v0.57.0-rc.0","v0.58.0","v0.58.0-rc.0","v0.59.0-alpha.0","v0.59.0-alpha.1","v0.59.0-alpha.2","v0.59.0-rc.0","v0.59.0-rc.1","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.1-alpha.0","v0.60.0-alpha.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.0-alpha.0","v0.7.0-alpha.1","v0.7.0-alpha.2","v0.7.0-alpha.3","v0.7.0-alpha.4","v0.7.0-alpha.5","v0.8.0","v0.8.0-alpha.0","v0.8.0-alpha.1","v0.8.0-alpha.2","v0.9.0","v0.9.0-alpha.0","v0.9.0-alpha.1","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v1.0.0-alpha.0","v1.0.0-beta.0","v1.1.0-alpha.0","v1.1.0-rc.0","v1.2.0-alpha.0","v1.2.0-beta.0","v1.2.0-rc.0","v1.3.0-alpha.0","v1.3.0-beta.0","v1.4.0-alpha.0","v1.4.0-alpha.1","v1.4.0-rc.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-alpha.0","v1.5.0-beta.0","v1.5.0-rc.0","v1.5.0-rc.1","v1.5.0-rc.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64436.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/security/advisories/GHSA-7xgm-5prm-v5gc"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-269","CWE-276"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
