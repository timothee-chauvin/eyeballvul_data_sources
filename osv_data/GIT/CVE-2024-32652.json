Prior to 1.10.1, the application hangs when receiving a Host header with a value that `@hono/node-server` can't handle well. Invalid values are those that cannot be parsed by the `URL` as a hostname such as an empty string, slashes `/`, and other strings. The version 1.10.1 includes the fix for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/honojs/node-server","events":[{"introduced":"096e27d07a381eea47bbafc1278950ea0175713a"},{"fixed":"d61c8ec6a25d7e5ea3e8966c84102e51a5e0400f"}]}],"versions":["v1.10.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.9.0","v1.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-32652.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/honojs/node-server/commit/d847e60249fd8183ba0998bc379ba20505643204"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/honojs/node-server/issues/159"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/honojs/node-server/security/advisories/GHSA-hgxw-5xg3-69jx"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-755"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
