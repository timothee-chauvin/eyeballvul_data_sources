It might overwrite a\nlocal file using the same name as the header specifies.\n\nThe stripping of the directory did not take backslashes into account. On\nsome operating systems, backslashes are used to separate directories and\nfilenames. This allows a rogue server to send back a response that\noverwrites a filename in the local machine that the user is allowed to\nwrite, potentially a system file, a command or a known executable.\n\nOperating systems affected include Windows, Netware, MSDOS, OS/2 and\nSymbian.\n\nThis error is only present in the curl command line tool, it is NOT a\nproblem of the library libcurl.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"7.20.0"},{"fixed":"7.21.2"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git","events":[{"introduced":"80675818e0417be8c991513b328c5507e93b47e5"},{"fixed":"81f151c912105ded480c3c88a1be53ca345298a1"}]}],"versions":["7.21.1","7.21.0","7.20.1","7.20.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://curl.se/docs/CURL-CVE-2010-3842.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"113905634619107869494585090424042333659","length":713},"id":"CURL-CVE-2010-3842-a8357723","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git/commit/81f151c912105ded480c3c88a1be53ca345298a1","target":{"file":"src/main.c","function":"parse_filename"}}]}}],"database_specific":{"CWE":{"desc":"Path Traversal","id":"CWE-30"},"URL":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2010-3842.json","affects":"tool","last_affected":"7.21.1","package":"curl","severity":"High","www":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2010-3842.html"},"credits":[{"name":"Dan Fandrich","type":"FINDER"},{"name":"Daniel Stenberg","type":"REMEDIATION_DEVELOPER"}]}
