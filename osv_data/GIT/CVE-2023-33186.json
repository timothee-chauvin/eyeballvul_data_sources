The main development branch of Zulip Server from May 2, 2023 and later, including beta versions 7.0-beta1 and 7.0-beta2, is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in tooltips on the message feed. An attacker who can send messages could maliciously craft a topic for the message, such that a victim who hovers the tooltip for that topic in their message feed triggers execution of JavaScript code controlled by the attacker.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip","events":[{"introduced":"c0afd368436cf0e9ea37b5f2a78d284c38f3b25d"},{"fixed":"1af16642d901522558c7ca916287bf7bab37e193"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-33186.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/33xxx/CVE-2023-33186.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/03cfb3d9fe61c975d133121ec31a7357f0c9e18f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/3ca131743b00f42bad8edbac4ef92656d954c629"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/25370"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-4r83-8f94-hrph"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33186"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/33xxx/CVE-2023-33186.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L"}]}
