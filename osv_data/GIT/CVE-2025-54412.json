Versions 0.11.0 and below contain a inconsistency in the OperatorFuncNode which can be exploited to hide the execution of untrusted operator methods. This can then be used in a code reuse attack to invoke seemingly safe functions and escalate to arbitrary code execution with minimal and misleading trusted types. This is fixed in version 0.12.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/skops-dev/skops","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ab61439ba35bef6bb24109966e4ed19f08446f82"}]}],"versions":["v0.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54412.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54412.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/skops-dev/skops/commit/0aeca055509dfb48c1506870aabdd9e247adf603"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/skops-dev/skops/releases/tag/v0.12.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/skops-dev/skops/security/advisories/GHSA-m7f4-hrc6-fwg3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54412"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-351"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54412.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H"}]}
