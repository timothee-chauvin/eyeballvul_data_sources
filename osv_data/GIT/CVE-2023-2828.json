The size limit for that cache database can be configured using the `max-cache-size` statement in the configuration file; it defaults to 90% of the total amount of memory available on the host. When the size of the cache reaches 7/8 of the configured limit, a cache-cleaning algorithm starts to remove expired and/or least-recently used RRsets from the cache, to keep memory use below the configured limit.\n\nIt has been discovered that the effectiveness of the cache-cleaning algorithm used in `named` can be severely diminished by querying the resolver for specific RRsets in a certain order, effectively allowing the configured `max-cache-size` limit to be significantly exceeded.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.16.41, 9.18.0 through 9.18.15, 9.19.0 through 9.19.13, 9.11.3-S1 through 9.16.41-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.15-S1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/bind9","events":[{"introduced":"1477c19dd9a347ee19a42dac227f299a4680506f"},{"last_affected":"4df4cecf05f1ab9ade15a71733684187d1e6ccf7"},{"introduced":"a37581543167cd471036b0d43e767c9ffb825625"},{"last_affected":"4df4cecf05f1ab9ade15a71733684187d1e6ccf7"},{"introduced":"cab15392afd841fe3b0bacd894003376d857459a"},{"last_affected":"66a3c6b3188b12f76f0354d7f3821d4b5b205fc1"},{"introduced":"1f554acee8df440c2fc211f976b196b31b9c9284"},{"last_affected":"f53a0765c32c72a59f338f0a4ef5335264a410db"},{"introduced":"8db45afa1affcb823e68afdeddedf93e136f5d3e"},{"last_affected":"f53a0765c32c72a59f338f0a4ef5335264a410db"}]}],"versions":["v9.18.11","v9.18.12","v9.18.13","v9.18.14","v9.18.15","v9.19.0","v9.19.1","v9.19.10","v9.19.11","v9.19.12","v9.19.13","v9.19.2","v9.19.3","v9.19.4","v9.19.5","v9.19.6","v9.19.7","v9.19.8","v9.19.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-2828.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/06/21/6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-2828"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00021.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SEFCEVCTYEMKTWA7V7EYPI5YQQ4JWDLI/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U3K6AJK7RRSR53HRF5GGKPA6PDUDWOD2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230703-0010/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5439"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
