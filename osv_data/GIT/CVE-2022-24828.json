Integrators using Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent` can have a code injection vulnerability if the user can control the `$file` or `$identifier` argument. This leads to a vulnerability on packagist.org for example where the composer.json's `readme` field can be used as a vector for injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial via the `$file` argument, or git via the `$identifier` argument if you allow arbitrary data there (Packagist does not, but maybe other integrators do). Composer itself should not be affected by the vulnerability as it does not call `getFileContent` with arbitrary data into `$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledge this was not abused, and the vulnerability has been patched on packagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/composer/composer","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3e196135eacf9e519a6b00986bc6fe6aff977997"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.10.26"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/composer/composer","events":[{"introduced":"378b34c5e33c71d194f33e1b73a62ba22148ff13"},{"fixed":"ba61e768b410736efe61df01b61f1ec44f51474f"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.2.12"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/composer/composer","events":[{"introduced":"934ee6eed3c3ffd0aeccef7c1d255adcf0752b24"},{"fixed":"0f43aa1652c447a6bc7c9217ec133313b1d32e72"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.3"},{"fixed":"2.3.6"}]}}],"versions":["1.0.0-alpha10","1.0.0-alpha9","1.10.24","1.10.25","2.2.11","2.2.12","2.2.13","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.3.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24828.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/24xxx/CVE-2022-24828.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/2c40c53637c5c7e43fff7c09d3d324d632734709"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/security/advisories/GHSA-x7cr-6qr6-2hh6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/625MT3IKWKFVIWLSYZFSXHVUA2LES7YQ/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GWT6LDSRY7SFMTDZWJ4MS2ZBXHL7VQEF/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QD7JQWL6C4GVROO25DTXWYWM6BPOPPCG/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24828"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2022-09"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-20"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/24xxx/CVE-2022-24828.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
