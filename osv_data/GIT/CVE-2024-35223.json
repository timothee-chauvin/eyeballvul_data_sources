Dapr sends the app token of the invoker app instead of the app token of the invoked app. This causes of a leak of the application token of the invoker app to the invoked app when using Dapr as a gRPC proxy for remote service invocation. This vulnerability impacts Dapr users who use Dapr as a gRPC proxy for remote service invocation as well as the Dapr App API token functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the app token of the invoker app, potentially compromising security and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability was patched in version 1.13.3.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dapr/dapr","events":[{"introduced":"5980602c57e360a3354d409be516b8ffc4056fd1"},{"fixed":"4c359b561a1ce92f50b7c336daa575e196fa9464"}]}],"versions":["v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.13.2-rc.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-35223.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/dapr/dapr/security/advisories/GHSA-284c-x8m7-9w5h"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/dapr/dapr/commit/e0591e43d0cdfd30a2f2960dce5d9892dc98bc2c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/7404"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/7344"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.13.3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
