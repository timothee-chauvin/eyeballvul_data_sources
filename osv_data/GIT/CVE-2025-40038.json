SVM must\ndecode and emulate to skip the instruction if the CPU doesn't provide the\nnext RIP, and getting the instruction bytes to decode requires reading\nguest memory.  Reading guest memory through the emulator can fault, i.e.\ncan sleep, which is disallowed since the fastpath handlers run with IRQs\ndisabled.\n\n BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at
