Prior to versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0, it may happen that policy rules using namespace selector(s) in their match statements are mistakenly not applied during admission review request processing due to a missing error propagation in function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` in `pkg/utils/engine/labels.go`. As a consequence, security-critical mutations and validations are bypassed, potentially allowing attackers with K8s API access to perform malicious operations. This issue has been patched in versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a08b3fbead8235f84f6443b2d860f8fef143c756"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno","events":[{"introduced":"1d276d71bc62d2ec17184f80821fbead34d6aff7"},{"fixed":"338a72c59ddd055a3ad8aaae511bafa742608641"}]}],"versions":["1.3.0-rc10","1.6-dev","1.7-dev","1.8-dev","1.9-dev","helm-chart-v2.0.3","helm-chart-v2.0.3-rc1","helm-chart-v2.0.3-rc2","helm-chart-v2.1.0","helm-chart-v2.1.3","kyverno-chart-3.3.0","kyverno-chart-3.3.0-beta.1","kyverno-chart-3.3.0-rc.1","kyverno-chart-3.3.0-rc.2","kyverno-chart-3.3.0-rc.3","kyverno-chart-3.3.1","kyverno-chart-3.3.2","kyverno-chart-3.3.3","kyverno-chart-3.3.3-rc.1","kyverno-chart-3.3.4","kyverno-chart-3.3.4-rc.1","kyverno-chart-3.3.5","kyverno-chart-3.3.6","kyverno-chart-3.3.7","kyverno-chart-3.4.0-alpha.1","kyverno-chart-3.4.0-rc.1","kyverno-policies-chart-3.3.0","kyverno-policies-chart-3.3.0-beta.1","kyverno-policies-chart-3.3.0-rc.1","kyverno-policies-chart-3.3.0-rc.2","kyverno-policies-chart-3.3.0-rc.3","kyverno-policies-chart-3.3.1","kyverno-policies-chart-3.3.1-rc.1","kyverno-policies-chart-3.3.2","kyverno-policies-chart-3.3.2-rc.1","kyverno-policies-chart-3.3.3","kyverno-policies-chart-3.3.4","kyverno-policies-chart-3.4.0-alpha.1","kyverno-policies-chart-3.4.0-rc.1","test-dev","v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.10","v1.1.11","v1.1.12","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.3-rc1","v1.1.4","v1.1.4-rc1","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.6-rc1","v1.1.6-rc2","v1.1.6-rc3","v1.1.6-rc4","v1.1.6-rc5","v1.1.7","v1.1.7-rc1","v1.1.7-rc2","v1.1.7-rc3","v1.1.7-rc4","v1.1.8","v1.1.9","v1.13.0","v1.13.0-beta.1","v1.13.0-rc.1","v1.13.0-rc.2","v1.13.0-rc.3","v1.13.1","v1.13.1-rc.1","v1.13.2","v1.13.2-rc.1","v1.13.3","v1.13.4","v1.14.0-alpha.1","v1.14.0-rc.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.3.0-rc10","v1.3.0-rc11","v1.3.0-rc12","v1.3.0-rc2","v1.3.0-rc3","v1.3.0-rc4","v1.3.0-rc5","v1.3.0-rc6","v1.3.0-rc7","v1.3.0-rc8","v1.3.0-rc9","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.2-rc1","v1.3.2-rc2","v1.3.2-rc3","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.4-rc1","v1.3.5","v1.3.5-rc1","v1.3.5-rc2","v1.3.5-rc3","v1.3.5-rc4","v1.3.5-rc5","v1.3.6","v1.3.6-rc1","v1.3.6-rc2","v1.3.6-rc3","v1.3.6-rc4","v1.3.6-rc5","v1.4.0","v1.4.0-rc1","v1.4.0-rc2","v1.4.0-rc3","v1.4.0-rc4","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.2-rc1","v1.4.2-rc2","v1.4.2-rc3","v1.4.2-rc4","v1.4.3","v1.4.3-rc1","v1.4.3-rc2","v1.5.0-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-46342.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/security/advisories/GHSA-jrr2-x33p-6hvc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/commit/3ff923b7756e1681daf73849954bd88516589194"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1287"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
