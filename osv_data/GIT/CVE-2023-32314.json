  "details": "vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with Node's built-in modules. A sandbox escape vulnerability exists in vm2 for versions up to and including 3.9.17. It abuses an unexpected creation of a host object based on the specification of `Proxy`. As a result a threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
