{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-23322","published":"2024-02-09T22:51:53Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:40:44.921394Z","aliases":["BIT-envoy-2024-23322","GHSA-6p83-mfmh-qv38"],"summary":"Envoy crashes when idle and request per try timeout occur within the backoff interval","details":"Envoy is a high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Envoy will crash when certain timeouts happen within the same interval. The crash occurs when the following are true: 1. hedge_on_per_try_timeout is enabled, 2. per_try_idle_timeout is enabled (it can only be done in configuration), 3. per-try-timeout is enabled, either through headers or configuration and its value is equal, or within the backoff interval of the per_try_idle_timeout. This issue has been addressed in released 1.29.1, 1.28.1, 1.27.3, and 1.26.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"a6d1d66a62b985baed414ba90ad0daebfc074664"},{"fixed":"4fda4d79d06e1bd59e591be3f348223495083648"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"b5ca88acee3453c9459474b8f22215796eff4dde"},{"fixed":"0de8b2b94c75dbe8c2f897058e16d23d959783fa"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"7bba38b743bb3bca22dffb4a21c38ccc155fbef8"},{"fixed":"0fd81ee7ffcd7cfc864094b24dc9b5c3ade89ff2"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a0e580408ef4568b0a16c6663b6d8ae0c46aba6a"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.17.0","v1.18.0","v1.18.1","v1.18.2","v1.19.0","v1.2.0","v1.20.0","v1.21.0","v1.22.0","v1.23.0","v1.24.0","v1.25.0","v1.26.0","v1.26.1","v1.26.2","v1.26.3","v1.26.4","v1.26.5","v1.26.6","v1.27.0","v1.27.1","v1.27.2","v1.28.0","v1.29.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-23322.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-6p83-mfmh-qv38"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/843f9e6a123ed47ce139b421c14e7126f2ac685e"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-416"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
