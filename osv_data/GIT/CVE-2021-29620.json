Starting from version 3.1.0 of the service-api XML parsing was introduced. Unfortunately the XML parser was not configured properly to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user to import a specifically-crafted XML file which imports external Document Type Definition (DTD) file with external entities for extraction of secrets from Report Portal service-api module or server-side request forgery. This will be resolved in the 5.4.0 release.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/reportportal/service-api","events":[{"introduced":"f9a125e8757f8bd274f364a039cf3d866884d69c"},{"fixed":"00db4e4ef85344e4b483cd384907285574058e50"}]}],"versions":["3.1.0","3.1.1","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.3.0","3.3.1","4.0.0","4.1.0","4.1.1","4.2.0","4.2.1","4.3.0","4.3.1","4.3.10","4.3.11","4.3.2","4.3.3","4.3.4","4.3.5","4.3.6","4.3.7","4.3.8","4.3.9","5.0.0","5.1.0","5.1.0-RC","5.1.0-RC-2","5.1.0-RC-3","5.1.1","5.2.0","5.2.0-RC","5.2.1","5.2.2","5.2.3","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.3.4","5.3.5","v4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-29620.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/security/advisories/GHSA-24wf-7vf2-pv59"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/reportportal/service-api/pull/1392"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.epam.reportportal/service-api"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
