Otherwise, .loop_entry values from unrelated\nstates would poison env->cur_state.\n\nAdditionally, env->stack should not contain any states with\n.loop_entry != NULL. The states in env->stack are yet to be verified,\nwhile .loop_entry is set for states that reached an equivalent state.\nThis means that env->cur_state->loop_entry should always be NULL after\npop_stack().\n\nSee the selftest in the next commit for an example of the program that\nis not safe yet is accepted by verifier w/o this fix.\n\nThis change has some verification performance
