Prior to versions 6.8.119 and 25.0.20, a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the GroupOffice application, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites. The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting a crafted payload into a parameter that is later processed unsafely in the DOM. Versions 6.8.119 and 25.0.20 contain a fix for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/intermesh/groupoffice","events":[{"introduced":"86a5e33c9c9adfc29537c29d42fb0029f456837b"},{"fixed":"4fb53aecde1152823d459d7c97546b84e654714c"}]}],"versions":["v25.0.1","v25.0.10","v25.0.11","v25.0.12","v25.0.13","v25.0.14","v25.0.15","v25.0.16","v25.0.17","v25.0.18","v25.0.19","v25.0.2","v25.0.3","v25.0.4","v25.0.5","v25.0.6","v25.0.7","v25.0.8","v25.0.9","v6.8.100","v6.8.101","v6.8.102","v6.8.103","v6.8.104","v6.8.105","v6.8.106","v6.8.107","v6.8.108","v6.8.109","v6.8.110","v6.8.111","v6.8.112","v6.8.113","v6.8.114","v6.8.115","v6.8.116","v6.8.117","v6.8.118","v6.8.95","v6.8.96","v6.8.97","v6.8.98","v6.8.99"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48368.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/48xxx/CVE-2025-48368.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/security/advisories/GHSA-c49j-qvp9-vgg6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48368"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/48xxx/CVE-2025-48368.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:P"}]}
