{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-1893","published":"2025-03-04T01:15:11Z","modified":"2025-10-22T08:03:44.290734Z","details":"A vulnerability was found in Open5GS up to 2.7.2. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function gmm_state_authentication of the file src/amf/gmm-sm.c of the component AMF. The manipulation leads to denial of service. The attack can be launched remotely. This vulnerability allows a single UE to crash the AMF, resulting in the complete loss of mobility and session management services and causing a network-wide outage. All registered UEs will lose connectivity, and new registrations will be blocked until the AMF is restarted, leading to a high availability impact. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The patch is named e31e9965f00d9c744a7f728497cb4f3e97744ee8. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e31e9965f00d9c744a7f728497cb4f3e97744ee8"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.10","v0.3.11","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.3.8","v0.3.9","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.3.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.18","v2.0.22","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.1.7","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.6","v2.2.7","v2.2.8","v2.2.9","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.6","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.5","v2.4.7","v2.4.8","v2.4.9","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.6.3","v2.6.4","v2.6.6","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.7.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-1893.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"174147939507531387888163707997447221142","length":8015},"id":"CVE-2025-1893-92a56add","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/commit/e31e9965f00d9c744a7f728497cb4f3e97744ee8","target":{"file":"src/amf/gmm-sm.c","function":"gmm_state_authentication"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://vuldb.com/?id.298411"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://vuldb.com/?submit.505952"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/3707"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/3707#issue-2833194192"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/3707#issuecomment-2639620554"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/commit/e31e9965f00d9c744a7f728497cb4f3e97744ee8"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.298411"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
