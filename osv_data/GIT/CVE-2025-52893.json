OpenBao before v2.3.0 may leak sensitive information in logs when processing malformed data. This is separate from the earlier HCSEC-2025-09 / CVE-2025-4166. This issue has been fixed in OpenBao v2.3.0 and later. Like with HCSEC-2025-09, there is no known workaround except to ensure properly formatted requests from all clients.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openbao/openbao","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"cf5e920badbf96b41253534a3fd5ff5063bf4b30"}]}],"versions":["api/auth/approle/v0.1.0","api/auth/approle/v0.1.1","api/auth/approle/v0.2.0","api/auth/approle/v0.3.0","api/auth/approle/v0.4.0","api/auth/approle/v0.4.1","api/auth/approle/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/approle/v2.0.1","api/auth/approle/v2.2.0","api/auth/approle/v2.3.0","api/auth/aws/v0.1.0","api/auth/aws/v0.2.0","api/auth/aws/v0.3.0","api/auth/aws/v0.4.0","api/auth/aws/v0.4.1","api/auth/aws/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/azure/v0.1.0","api/auth/azure/v0.2.0","api/auth/azure/v0.3.0","api/auth/azure/v0.4.0","api/auth/azure/v0.4.1","api/auth/azure/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/gcp/v0.1.0","api/auth/gcp/v0.2.0","api/auth/gcp/v0.3.0","api/auth/gcp/v0.4.0","api/auth/gcp/v0.4.1","api/auth/gcp/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/kubernetes/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/kubernetes/v2.0.1","api/auth/kubernetes/v2.2.0","api/auth/kubernetes/v2.3.0","api/auth/ldap/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/ldap/v2.0.1","api/auth/ldap/v2.2.0","api/auth/ldap/v2.3.0","api/auth/userpass/v0.1.0","api/auth/userpass/v0.2.0","api/auth/userpass/v0.3.0","api/auth/userpass/v0.4.0","api/auth/userpass/v0.4.1","api/auth/userpass/v1.1.0-development20240408","api/auth/userpass/v2.0.1","api/auth/userpass/v2.2.0","api/auth/userpass/v2.3.0","api/v1.0.1","api/v1.0.2","api/v1.0.3","api/v1.0.4","api/v1.1.1","api/v1.100.0-development20240408","api/v1.2.0","api/v1.3.1","api/v1.5.0","api/v1.6.0","api/v1.7.0","api/v1.7.1","api/v1.7.2","api/v1.8.0","api/v1.8.1","api/v1.8.2","api/v1.8.3","api/v1.9.0","api/v1.9.1","api/v1.9.2","api/v2.0.1","api/v2.1.0","api/v2.2.0","api/v2.3.0","before-plugin-removal","dev-namespaces-base-20250215","dev-namespaces-base-20250311","dev-namespaces-base-20250424","fork-point","sdk/v0.1.10","sdk/v0.1.11","sdk/v0.1.12","sdk/v0.1.13","sdk/v0.1.8","sdk/v0.1.9","sdk/v0.2.1","sdk/v0.3.0","sdk/v0.4.1","sdk/v0.5.0","sdk/v0.5.1","sdk/v0.5.3","sdk/v0.6.0","sdk/v0.6.1","sdk/v0.6.2","sdk/v0.7.0","sdk/v0.8.0","sdk/v0.9.0","sdk/v0.9.1","sdk/v1.100.0-development20240408","sdk/v2.0.1","sdk/v2.1.0","sdk/v2.2.0","sdk/v2.3.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha20240329","v2.0.0-beta20240618","v2.1.0-beta20241114","v2.1.0-beta20241114.1","v2.1.0-beta20241114.2","v2.1.0-beta20241114.3","v2.2.0-beta20250213","v2.3.0-beta20250528"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52893.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/go-viper/mapstructure","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8c61ec1924fcfa522f9fc6b4618c672db61d1a38"},{"fixed":"ed3f92181528ff776a0324107b8b55026e93766a"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-alpha.1","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52893.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2025-09-vault-may-expose-sensitive-information-in-error-logs-when-processing-malformed-data-with-the-kv-v2-plugin/74717"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/go-viper/mapstructure/commit/ed3f92181528ff776a0324107b8b55026e93766a"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/go-viper/mapstructure/pull/105"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/go-viper/mapstructure/releases/tag/v2.3.0"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/openbao/openbao/commit/cf5e920badbf96b41253534a3fd5ff5063bf4b30"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/openbao/openbao/security/advisories/GHSA-8f5r-8cmq-7fmq"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-532"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
