target\nfirst, note the mirror number (3, which is beyond RAID1 duplication,\nthus it's read from the replace target device).\n\nThen at the BUG_ON() location, we are trying to writeback the repaired\nsectors back the failed device.\n\nThe check looks like this:\n\n\t\tret = btrfs_map_block(fs_info, BTRFS_MAP_WRITE, logical,\n\t\t\t\t      &map_length, &bioc, mirror_num);\n\t\tif (ret)\n\t\t\tgoto out_counter_dec;\n\t\tBUG_ON(mirror_num != bioc->mirror_num);\n\nBut inside btrfs_map_block(), we can modify bioc->mirror_num especially\nfor dev-replace:\n\n\tif (dev_replace_is_ongoing && mirror_num == map->num_stripes + 1 &&\n\t    !need_full_stripe(op) && dev_replace->tgtdev != NULL) {\n\t\tret = get_extra_mirror_from_replace(fs_info, logical, *length,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    dev_replace->srcdev->devid,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    &mirror_num,\n\t\t\t\t\t    &physical_to_patch_in_first_stripe);\n\t\tpatch_the_first_stripe_for_dev_replace = 1;\n\t}\n\nThus if we're repairing the replace target device, we're going to\ntrigger that BUG_ON().\n\nBut in reality, the read failure from the replace target device may be\nthat, our replace hasn't reached the range we're reading, thus we're\nreading garbage, but with replace running, the range would be properly\nfilled later.\n\nThus in that case, we don't need to do anything but let the replace\nroutine to handle it.\n\n[FIX]\nInstead of a BUG_ON(), just skip the repair if we're repairing the\ndevice replace target device.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ad6d620e2a5704f6bf3a39c92a75aad962c51cb3"},{"fixed":"a7018b40b49c37fb55736499f790ec0d2b381ae4"},{"fixed":"53e9d6851b56626885476a2966194ba994f8bb4b"},{"fixed":"d73a27b86fc722c28a26ec64002e3a7dc86d1c07"}]}],"versions":["v3.10","v3.10-rc1","v3.10-rc2","v3.10-rc3","v3.10-rc4","v3.10-rc5","v3.10-rc6","v3.10-rc7","v3.11","v3.11-rc1","v3.11-rc2","v3.11-rc3","v3.11-rc4","v3.11-rc5","v3.11-rc6","v3.11-rc7","v3.12","v3.12-rc1","v3.12-rc2","v3.12-rc3","v3.12-rc4","v3.12-rc5","v3.12-rc6","v3.12-rc7","v3.13","v3.13-rc1","v3.13-rc2","v3.13-rc3","v3.13-rc4","v3.13-rc5","v3.13-rc6","v3.13-rc7","v3.13-rc8","v3.14","v3.14-rc1","v3.14-rc2","v3.14-rc3","v3.14-rc4","v3.14-rc5","v3.14-rc6","v3.14-rc7","v3.14-rc8","v3.15","v3.15-rc1","v3.15-rc2","v3.15-rc3","v3.15-rc4","v3.15-rc5","v3.15-rc6","v3.15-rc7","v3.15-rc8","v3.16","v3.16-rc1","v3.16-rc2","v3.16-rc3","v3.16-rc4","v3.16-rc5","v3.16-rc6","v3.16-rc7","v3.17","v3.17-rc1","v3.17-rc2","v3.17-rc3","v3.17-rc4","v3.17-rc5","v3.17-rc6","v3.17-rc7","v3.18","v3.18-rc1","v3.18-rc2","v3.18-rc3","v3.18-rc4","v3.18-rc5","v3.18-rc6","v3.18-rc7","v3.19","v3.19-rc1","v3.19-rc2","v3.19-rc3","v3.19-rc4","v3.19-rc5","v3.19-rc6","v3.19-rc7","v3.8","v3.8-rc1","v3.8-rc2","v3.8-rc3","v3.8-rc4","v3.8-rc5","v3.8-rc6","v3.8-rc7","v3.9","v3.9-rc1","v3.9-rc2","v3.9-rc3","v3.9-rc4","v3.9-rc5","v3.9-rc6","v3.9-rc7","v3.9-rc8","v4.0","v4.0-rc1","v4.0-rc2","v4.0-rc3","v4.0-rc4","v4.0-rc5","v4.0-rc6","v4.0-rc7","v4.1","v4.1-rc1","v4.1-rc2","v4.1-rc3","v4.1-rc4","v4.1-rc5","v4.1-rc6","v4.1-rc7","v4.1-rc8","v4.10","v4.10-rc1","v4.10-rc2","v4.10-rc3","v4.10-rc4","v4.10-rc5","v4.10-rc6","v4.10-rc7","v4.10-rc8","v4.11","v4.11-rc1","v4.11-rc2","v4.11-rc3","v4.11-rc4","v4.11-rc5","v4.11-rc6","v4.11-rc7","v4.11-rc8","v4.12","v4.12-rc1","v4.12-rc2","v4.12-rc3","v4.12-rc4","v4.12-rc5","v4.12-rc6","v4.12-rc7","v4.13","v4.13-rc1","v4.13-rc2","v4.13-rc3","v4.13-rc4","v4.13-rc5","v4.13-rc6","v4.13-rc7","v4.14","v4.14-rc1","v4.14-rc2","v4.14-rc3","v4.14-rc4","v4.14-rc5","v4.14-rc6","v4.14-rc7","v4.14-rc8","v4.15","v4.15-rc1","v4.15-rc2","v4.15-rc3","v4.15-rc4","v4.15-rc5","v4.15-rc6","v4.15-rc7","v4.15-rc8","v4.15-rc9","v4.16","v4.16-rc1","v4.16-rc2","v4.16-rc3","v4.16-rc4","v4.16-rc5","v4.16-rc6","v4.16-rc7","v4.17","v4.17-rc1","v4.17-rc2","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.2","v4.2-rc1","v4.2-rc2","v4.2-rc3","v4.2-rc4","v4.2-rc5","v4.2-rc6","v4.2-rc7","v4.2-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v4.3","v4.3-rc1","v4.3-rc2","v4.3-rc3","v4.3-rc4","v4.3-rc5","v4.3-rc6","v4.3-rc7","v4.4","v4.4-rc1","v4.4-rc2","v4.4-rc3","v4.4-rc4","v4.4-rc5","v4.4-rc6","v4.4-rc7","v4.4-rc8","v4.5","v4.5-rc1","v4.5-rc2","v4.5-rc3","v4.5-rc4","v4.5-rc5","v4.5-rc6","v4.5-rc7","v4.6","v4.6-rc1","v4.6-rc2","v4.6-rc3","v4.6-rc4","v4.6-rc5","v4.6-rc6","v4.6-rc7","v4.7","v4.7-rc1","v4.7-rc2","v4.7-rc3","v4.7-rc4","v4.7-rc5","v4.7-rc6","v4.7-rc7","v4.8","v4.8-rc1","v4.8-rc2","v4.8-rc3","v4.8-rc4","v4.8-rc5","v4.8-rc6","v4.8-rc7","v4.8-rc8","v4.9","v4.9-rc1","v4.9-rc2","v4.9-rc3","v4.9-rc4","v4.9-rc5","v4.9-rc6","v4.9-rc7","v4.9-rc8","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6
