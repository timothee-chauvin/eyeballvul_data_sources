However, it is found that the internal index can be forged by adding additional properties into user-input. If index is found in the query, taffyDB will ignore other query conditions and directly return the indexed data item. Moreover, the internal index is in an easily-guessable format (e.g., T000002R000001). As such, attackers can use this vulnerability to access any data items in the DB.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/piscis/taffydb-node","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2daaf29120960fd58533ac37295ca6ca8387a083"}]}],"versions":["2.6.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-10790.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-TAFFYDB-2992450"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-TAFFY-546521"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
