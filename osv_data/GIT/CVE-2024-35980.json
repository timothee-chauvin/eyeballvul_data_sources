Unfortunately, the operand passed\nto the TLBI RANGE instruction isn't correctly sorted out due to the\ncommit 117940aa6e5f (\"KVM: arm64: Define kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range()\").\nIt leads to crash on the destination VM after live migration because\nTLBs aren't flushed completely and some of the dirty pages are missed.\n\nFor example, I have a VM where 8GB memory is assigned, starting from\n0x40000000 (1GB). Note that the host has 4KB as the base page size.\nIn the middile of migration, kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range() is executed\nto flush TLBs. It passes MAX_TLBI_RANGE_PAGES as the argument to\n__kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range() and __flush_s2_tlb_range_op(). SCALE#3\nand NUM#31, corresponding to MAX_TLBI_RANGE_PAGES, isn't supported\nby __TLBI_RANGE_NUM(). In this specific case, -1 has been returned\nfrom __TLBI_RANGE_NUM() for SCALE#3/2/1/0 and rejected by the loop\nin the __flush_tlb_range_op() until the variable @scale underflows\nand becomes -9, 0xffff708000040000 is set as the operand. The operand\nis wrong since it's sorted out by __TLBI_VADDR_RANGE() according to\ninvalid @scale and @num.\n\nFix it by extending __TLBI_RANGE_NUM() to support the combination of\nSCALE#3 and NUM#31. With the changes, [-1 31] instead of [-1 30] can\nbe returned from the macro, meaning the TLBs for 0x200000 pages in the\nabove example can be flushed in one shoot with SCALE#3 and NUM#31. The\nmacro TLBI_RANGE_MASK is dropped since no one uses it any more. The\ncomments are also adjusted accordingly.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"117940aa6e5f8308f1529e1313660980f1dae771"},{"fixed":"ac4ad513de4fba18b4ac0ace132777d0910e8cfa"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"117940aa6e5f8308f1529e1313660980f1dae771"},{"fixed":"944db7b536baaf49d7e576af36a94f4719552b07"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"117940aa6e5f8308f1529e1313660980f1dae771"},{"fixed":"e3ba51ab24fddef79fc212f9840de54db8fd1685"}]}],"versions":["v6.5","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.3","v6.6.4","v6.6.5","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.8.1","v6.8.2","v6.8.3","v6.8.4","v6.8.5","v6.8.6","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-35980.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.6.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.29"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.8.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-35980.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/944db7b536baaf49d7e576af36a94f4719552b07"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ac4ad513de4fba18b4ac0ace132777d0910e8cfa"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e3ba51ab24fddef79fc212f9840de54db8fd1685"}]}
