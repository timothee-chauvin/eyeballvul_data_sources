{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-29517","published":"2023-04-18T23:54:12.665Z","modified":"2025-11-20T07:32:53.387078Z","aliases":["GHSA-m3c3-9qj7-7xmx"],"summary":"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-office-viewer","details":"XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. The office document viewer macro was allowing anyone to see any file content from the hosting server, provided that the office server was connected and depending on the permissions of the user running the servlet engine (e.g. tomcat) running XWiki. The same vulnerability also allowed to perform internal requests to resources from the hosting server. The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.10.1, 14.4.8, 15.0-rc-1. Users are advised to upgrade. It might be possible to workaround this vulnerability by running XWiki in a sandbox with a user with very low privileges on the machine.\n\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"08e0887f0362b21614e6bfcb5be7e1f568659c41"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-29517.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8d72461ba6976af6005e2df511bdeeeb17ef2d74"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-29517.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-m3c3-9qj7-7xmx"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20324"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20447"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20449"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
