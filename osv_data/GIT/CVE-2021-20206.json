When specifying the plugin to load in the 'type' field in the network configuration, it is possible to use special elements such as \"../\" separators to reference binaries elsewhere on the system. This flaw allows an attacker to execute other existing binaries other than the cni plugins/types, such as 'reboot'. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/containernetworking/cni","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9fc34aee0a6396d6484992035819c92c42522eea"}]}],"versions":["spec-v0.1.0","spec-v0.2.0","spec-v0.3.0","spec-v0.3.1","spec-v0.4.0","v0.1.0","v0.2.0-rc0","v0.3.0","v0.3.0-rc0","v0.3.0-rc1","v0.3.0-rc2","v0.3.0-rc3","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.0-rc1","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.6.0","v0.6.0-rc1","v0.6.0-rc2","v0.7.0","v0.7.0-alpha0","v0.7.0-alpha1","v0.7.0-rc1","v0.7.0-rc2","v0.7.1","v0.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-20206.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1919391"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMCONTAINERNETWORKINGCNIPKGINVOKE-1070549"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
