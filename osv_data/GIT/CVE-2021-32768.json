In affected versions failing to properly parse, sanitize and encode malicious rich-text content, the content rendering process in the website frontend is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Corresponding rendering instructions via TypoScript functionality HTMLparser does not consider all potentially malicious HTML tag & attribute combinations per default. In default scenarios, a valid backend user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability. In case custom plugins used in the website frontend accept and reflect rich-text content submitted by users, no authentication is required. Update to TYPO3 versions 7.6.53 ELTS, 8.7.42 ELTS, 9.5.29, 10.4.19, 11.3.2 that fix the problem described.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/typo3/typo3.cms","events":[{"introduced":"c91b70e450c52d29ffb08115fffbb7832b15a330"},{"last_affected":"7c21aadae437dd9cc237e80040ab5cc5adfe46fe"},{"introduced":"41235ff8e38c6f3401df03ae8beddd62d662c525"},{"last_affected":"860158afc7f8aceb8eb39495e37c80a6252ed1eb"},{"introduced":"6a5e2d4097ef0a0e3ea955af93cf83810d6fa234"},{"last_affected":"e16fd6e981db27974953352e95a99fb11aabf5d9"}]}],"versions":["v10.0.0","v10.1.0","v10.2.0","v10.3.0","v10.4.0","v10.4.1","v10.4.10","v10.4.11","v10.4.12","v10.4.13","v10.4.14","v10.4.15","v10.4.16","v10.4.17","v10.4.18","v10.4.2","v10.4.3","v10.4.4","v10.4.5","v10.4.6","v10.4.7","v10.4.8","v10.4.9","v11.0.0","v11.1.0","v11.2.0","v11.3.0","v11.3.1","v9.0.0","v9.1.0","v9.2.0","v9.3.0","v9.4.0","v9.5.0","v9.5.1","v9.5.10","v9.5.11","v9.5.12","v9.5.13","v9.5.14","v9.5.15","v9.5.16","v9.5.17","v9.5.18","v9.5.19","v9.5.2","v9.5.20","v9.5.21","v9.5.22","v9.5.23","v9.5.24","v9.5.25","v9.5.26","v9.5.27","v9.5.28","v9.5.3","v9.5.4","v9.5.5","v9.5.6","v9.5.7","v9.5.8","v9.5.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32768.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-c5c9-8c6m-727v"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-013"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
