Supplemental Files are allowed to be viewed in the browser, only if they have a white-listed MIME type. Unfortunately, this logic is broken, thus allowing unsafe files containing Javascript to be executed with the application context. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by uploading a supplementary file that contains a malicious code or script. This code will then be executed when the file is loaded in the browser. The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.11.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mkucej/i-librarian-free","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9695331315aed82e47bead750839df7da08073d5"}]}],"versions":["5.0.2","5.0.3","5.0.4","5.0.5","5.0.6","5.0.7","5.0.8","5.1.0","5.10.1","5.10.3","5.10.4","5.11.0","5.11.1","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.2.2","5.2.3","5.3.0","5.4.0","5.5.0","5.6.0","5.6.1","5.7.0","5.7.1","5.7.2","5.8.0","5.9.0","5.9.1","5.9.2","5.9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-50344.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/50xxx/CVE-2024-50344.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mkucej/i-librarian-free/commit/a67d7949ffb02fd912ebdcf552df006b44066d78"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/mkucej/i-librarian-free/security/advisories/GHSA-c2rm-w62w-5xmj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50344"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-80"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/50xxx/CVE-2024-50344.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
