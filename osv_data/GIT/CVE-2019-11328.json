The manipulation of those files can change the behavior of the starter-suid program when instances are joined resulting in potential privilege escalation on the host.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/hpcng/singularity","events":[{"introduced":"aba105425005bf776f0ffe1d8762c575b410de11"},{"fixed":"8ed39ade65934bf8cc202c7c5d3bf6ac2ae17c9d"}]}],"versions":["v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.1-rc1","v3.2.0-rc1","v3.2.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-11328.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sylabs/singularity","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8ed39ade65934bf8cc202c7c5d3bf6ac2ae17c9d"}]}],"versions":["1.0","2.0","2.1","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.2","2.3","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.4","2.4.1","2.4.2","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-alpha.1","v3.0.0-alpha.2","v3.0.0-beta.1","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.2-rc1","v3.0.2-rc2","v3.0.3","v3.0.3-rc1","v3.0.3-rc2","v3.1.0","v3.1.0-rc1","v3.1.0-rc2","v3.1.0-rc3","v3.1.0-rc4","v3.1.1","v3.1.1-rc1","v3.2.0-rc1","v3.2.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-11328.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108360"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5O3TPL5OOTIZEI4H6IQBCCISBARJ6WL3/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LIHV7DSEVTB5SUPEZ2UXGS3Q6WMEQSO2/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LNU5BUHFOTYUZVHFUSX2VG4S3RCPUEMA/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-10/msg00028.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00059.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/05/16/1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/tag/v3.2.0"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
