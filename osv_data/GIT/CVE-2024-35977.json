This can trigger a NULL pointer\ndereference:\n\n    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\n    ...\n    Call Trace:\n     <TASK>\n     ...\n     ? ttyport_receive_buf\n\nA simplified version of crashing code is as follows:\n\n    static inline size_t serdev_controller_receive_buf(struct serdev_controller *ctrl,\n                                                      const u8 *data,\n                                                      size_t count)\n    {\n            struct serdev_device *serdev = ctrl->serdev;\n\n            if (!serdev || !serdev->ops->receive_buf) // CRASH!\n                return 0;\n\n            return serdev->ops->receive_buf(serdev, data, count);\n    }\n\nIt assumes that if SERPORT_ACTIVE is set and serdev exists, serdev->ops\nwill also exist.
