If userspace\nforces the vCPU out of SMM while it's post-VMXON and then injects an SMI,\nvmx_enter_smm() will overwrite vmx->nested.smm.vmxon and end up with both\nvmxon=false and smm.vmxon=false, but all other nVMX state allocated.\n\nDon't attempt to gracefully handle the transition as (a) most transitions\nare nonsencial, e.g. forcing SMM while L2 is running, (b) there isn't\nsufficient information to handle all transitions, e.g. SVM wants access\nto the SMRAM save state, and (c) KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS must precede\nKVM_SET_NESTED_STATE during state restore as the latter disallows putting\nthe vCPU into L2 if SMM is active, and disallows tagging the vCPU as\nbeing post-VMXON in SMM if SMM is not active.\n\nAbuse of KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS manifests as a WARN and memory leak in nVMX\ndue to failure to free vmcs01's shadow VMCS, but the bug goes far beyond\njust a memory leak, e.g. toggling SMM on while L2 is active puts the vCPU\nin an architecturally impossible state.\n\n
