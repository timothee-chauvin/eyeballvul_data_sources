{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-64102","published":"2025-10-29T18:36:15Z","modified":"2025-11-06T02:49:46.712705Z","aliases":["GHSA-xrw9-r35x-x878","GO-2025-4085"],"summary":"Zitadel allows brute-forcing authentication factors","details":"Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. Prior to 4.6.0, 3.4.3, and 2.71.18, an attacker can perform an online brute-force attack on OTP, TOTP, and passwords. While Zitadel allows preventing online brute force attacks in scenarios like TOTP, Email OTP, or passwords using a lockout mechanism. The mechanism is not enabled by default and can cause a denial of service for the corresponding user if enabled. Additionally, the mitigation strategies were not fully implemented in the more recent resource-based APIs. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.6.0, 3.4.3, and 2.71.18.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel","events":[{"introduced":"8f0b7ebf028187e84881694bb931cbe33604e308"},{"fixed":"f7309f82953713922421add61d85994d876e8999"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"4.0.0-rc.1"},{"fixed":"4.6.0"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel","events":[{"introduced":"0f0a55ca18873b85feaca561e6f0b3f081ad4204"},{"fixed":"921ad56a2163f86b8ff32b9ddaaab64bea3d4fd4"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.0.0-rc.1"},{"fixed":"3.4.3"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel","events":[{"introduced":"5b284f8c9ba65a88fb4d58ac6aa34be429b19e8e"},{"fixed":"396cdd436cd5e1b217b1f0af4e1a3bd03d1dea5f"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.71.18"}]}}],"versions":["2.20.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.11.1","v2.12.0","v2.13.0","v2.13.1","v2.14.0","v2.14.1","v2.14.2","v2.14.3","v2.14.4","v2.14.5","v2.15.0","v2.16.0","v2.16.1","v2.17.0","v2.17.1","v2.18.0","v2.19.0","v2.2.0","v2.20.0","v2.21.0","v2.22.0","v2.22.1","v2.22.2","v2.23.0","v2.23.1","v2.24.0","v2.25.0","v2.25.1","v2.25.2","v2.25.3","v2.26.0","v2.26.1","v2.26.2","v2.27.0","v2.27.1","v2.28.0","v2.28.0-rc.1","v2.28.1","v2.29.0","v2.29.0-rc.1","v2.29.0-rc.2","v2.29.0-rc.3","v2.29.0-rc.4","v2.29.1","v2.29.2","v2.29.3","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.30.0","v2.31.0","v2.31.1","v2.31.2","v2.31.3","v2.31.4","v2.31.5","v2.32.0","v2.33.0","v2.33.1","v2.34.0","v2.34.1","v2.35.0","v2.35.1","v2.36.0","v2.36.1","v2.36.2","v2.36.3","v2.37.0","v2.37.1","v2.37.2","v2.37.3","v2.38.0","v2.38.1","v2.39.0","v2.39.1","v2.39.2","v2.39.3","v2.4.0","v2.40.0","v2.40.1","v2.40.2","v2.40.3","v2.40.4","v2.40.5","v2.41.0","v2.41.1","v2.41.2","v2.41.3","v2.41.4","v2.41.5","v2.42.0","v2.42.1","v2.42.2","v2.42.3","v2.43.0","v2.43.0-rc.1","v2.43.0-rc.2","v2.43.0-rc.3","v2.43.0-rc.4","v2.43.0-rc.5","v2.43.0-rc.6","v2.43.0-rc.7","v2.43.1","v2.43.2","v2.43.3","v2.43.4","v2.43.5","v2.44.0","v2.44.1","v2.44.2","v2.45.0","v2.46.0","v2.47.0","v2.47.1","v2.47.2","v2.47.3","v2.47.4","v2.47.5","v2.47.6","v2.48.0","v2.48.1","v2.48.2","v2.48.3","v2.49.0","v2.49.1","v2.49.2","v2.49.3","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.50.0","v2.50.1","v2.50.2","v2.50.3","v2.50.4","v2.50.5","v2.51.0","v2.51.1","v2.51.2","v2.51.3","v2.51.4","v2.52.0","v2.52.0-rc.1","v2.52.0-rc.2","v2.52.1","v2.53.0","v2.53.0-rc.1","v2.53.1","v2.53.2","v2.54.0","v2.54.1","v2.54.2","v2.54.3","v2.55.0","v2.55.0-rc.1","v2.55.1","v2.55.2","v2.56.0","v2.56.0-rc.1","v2.56.0-rc.2","v2.56.0-rc.3","v2.56.0-rc.4","v2.56.1","v2.57.0","v2.58.0","v2.58.1","v2.58.2","v2.58.3","v2.59.0","v2.59.1","v2.6.0","v2.60.0","v2.61.0","v2.62.0","v2.62.1","v2.62.2","v2.62.3","v2.63.0","v2.63.1","v2.63.2","v2.63.3","v2.63.4","v2.64.0","v2.64.1","v2.65.0","v2.65.1","v2.65.2","v2.65.3","v2.65.4","v2.66.0","v2.66.1","v2.66.2","v2.66.3","v2.67.0","v2.67.1","v2.67.2","v2.67.3","v2.67.4","v2.68.0","v2.68.1","v2.69.0","v2.69.1","v2.69.2","v2.69.3","v2.7.0","v2.70.0","v2.70.1","v2.71.0","v2.71.1","v2.71.10","v2.71.11","v2.71.12","v2.71.13","v2.71.14","v2.71.15","v2.71.16","v2.71.17","v2.71.2","v2.71.3","v2.71.4","v2.71.5","v2.71.6","v2.71.7","v2.71.8","v2.71.9","v2.8.0","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-rc.1","v3.0.0-rc.2","v3.0.0-rc.3","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.2.3","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.3.4","v3.3.5","v3.3.6","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.4.2","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-rc.1","v4.0.0-rc.2","v4.0.0-rc.3","v4.0.0-rc.4","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.1.3","v4.1.4","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v4.4.0","v4.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64102.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/b8db8cdf9cc8ea13f461758aef12457f8b7d972a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-xrw9-r35x-x878"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-307"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
