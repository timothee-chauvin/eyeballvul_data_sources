CarrierWave has a Content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability, possibly leading to XSS. The validation in `allowlisted_content_type?` determines Content-Type permissions by performing a partial match. If the `content_type` argument of `allowlisted_content_type?` is passed a value crafted by the attacker, Content-Types not included in the `content_type_allowlist` will be allowed. This issue has been patched in versions 2.2.5 and 3.0.5.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave","events":[{"introduced":"13330a70323cde83b319520f5c1874227de79cdf"},{"fixed":"0fcff94cebce07b856531d6502b11466e8331409"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.2.0"},{"fixed":"2.2.5"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave","events":[{"introduced":"269c37a6c8609c26915f31ccfada512ef12fb3cb"},{"fixed":"5316b352b6ed38595e99622eeb954a2cd0b1d5c2"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.0.0"},{"fixed":"3.0.5"}]}}],"versions":["v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-49090.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/49xxx/CVE-2023-49090.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/commit/39b282db5c1303899b3d3381ce8a837840f983b5"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/commit/863d425c76eba12c3294227b39018f6b2dccbbf3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/security/advisories/GHSA-gxhx-g4fq-49hj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49090"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/49xxx/CVE-2023-49090.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
