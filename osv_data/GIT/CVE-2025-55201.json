{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-55201","published":"2025-08-18T16:21:25.576Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:39:21.186042Z","aliases":["GHSA-3xw7-v6cj-5q8h"],"summary":"Copier safe template has arbitrary filesystem read/write access","details":"Copier library and CLI app for rendering project templates. Prior to 9.9.1, a safe template can currently read and write arbitrary files because Copier exposes a few pathlib.Path objects in the Jinja context which have unconstrained I/O methods. This effectively renders the security model w.r.t. filesystem access useless. This vulnerability is fixed in 9.9.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/copier-org/copier","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"165c85a1536c99af9422b70ac064cf1355347357"}]}],"versions":["1.1.1","3.0.0-alpha5","3.0.0-alpha6","v2.2.3","v2.3","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-alpha1","v3.0.0-alpha2","v3.0.0-alpha3","v3.0.0-alpha4","v3.0.0-alpha7","v3.0.0-alpha8","v3.0.0-beta1","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.1.0","v5.0.0","v5.1.0","v6.0.0","v6.0.0a0","v6.0.0a1","v6.0.0a2","v6.0.0a3","v6.0.0a4","v6.0.0a5","v6.0.0a6","v6.0.0a7","v6.0.0a8","v6.0.0a9","v6.0.0b0","v6.1.0","v6.2.0","v7.0.1","v7.1.0","v7.1.0a0","v7.2.0","v8.0.0","v8.1.0","v8.2.0","v8.3.0","v9.0.0","v9.0.1","v9.1.0","v9.1.1","v9.2.0","v9.3.0","v9.3.1","v9.4.0","v9.4.1","v9.5.0","v9.6.0","v9.7.0","v9.7.1","v9.8.0","v9.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-55201.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/copier-org/copier/commit/3feea3b3ff3c20d80cbb16a2f3b9567ffc5606d1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/copier-org/copier/security/advisories/GHSA-3xw7-v6cj-5q8h"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
