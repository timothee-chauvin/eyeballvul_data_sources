This flaw allows RODCs and users possessing the GET_CHANGES right to access all attributes, including sensitive secrets and passwords. Even in a default setup, RODC DC accounts, which should only replicate some passwords, can gain access to all domain secrets, including the vital krbtgt, effectively eliminating the RODC / DC distinction. Furthermore, the vulnerability fails to account for error conditions (fail open), like out-of-memory situations, potentially granting access to secret attributes, even under low-privileged attacker influence.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/samba-team/samba","events":[{"introduced":"df33344d8eb40221d60c99931690703a11d91bc2"},{"fixed":"7ec207cd4146919e4ee88e5522647c169baf6922"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-4154.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4154"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231124-0002/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2023-4154.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2241883"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15424"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
