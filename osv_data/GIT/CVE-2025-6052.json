If a string is already very large, combining it with more input can cause a hidden overflow in the size calculation. This makes the system think it has enough memory when it doesn’t. As a result, data may be written past the end of the allocated memory, leading to crashes or memory corruption.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/gnome/glib","events":[{"introduced":"b65044c52b78fab65a0415e2148f4b98a1680da2"},{"last_affected":"78cd78d2988616d9af0e8f43e703717d092cd3ff"}]}],"versions":["2.75.3","2.75.4","2.76.0","2.76.1","2.77.0","2.77.1","2.77.2","2.77.3","2.78.0","2.79.0","2.79.1","2.79.2","2.79.3","2.80.0","2.81.0","2.81.1","2.81.2","2.83.0","2.83.1","2.83.2","2.83.3","2.83.4","2.83.5","2.84.0","2.84.1","2.84.2","2.84.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-6052.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-6052"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2372666"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
