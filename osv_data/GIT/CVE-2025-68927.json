Prior to version 0.8.6-beta, LibreDesk is vulnerable to stored HTML injection in the contact notes feature. When adding notes via POST /api/v1/contacts/{id}/notes, the backend automatically wraps user input in <p> tags. However, by intercepting the request and removing the <p> tag, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML elements such as forms and images, which are then stored and rendered without proper sanitization. This can lead to phishing, CSRF-style forced actions, and UI redress attacks. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.6-beta.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/abhinavxd/libredesk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"270347849943ac6a43e9fd6ebdc99c71841900eb"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0-alpha","v0.1.1-alpha","v0.2.1-alpha","v0.3.0-alpha","v0.3.1-alpha","v0.3.2-alpha","v0.3.3-alpha","v0.4.0-alpha","v0.4.1-alpha","v0.4.2-alpha","v0.4.3-alpha","v0.5.0-alpha","v0.6.0-alpha","v0.7.0-alpha","v0.7.1-alpha","v0.7.2-alpha","v0.7.3-alpha","v0.7.4-alpha","v0.8.0-beta","v0.8.1-beta","v0.8.2-beta","v0.8.3-beta","v0.8.4-beta","v0.8.5-beta"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68927.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68927.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/abhinavxd/libredesk/commit/270347849943ac6a43e9fd6ebdc99c71841900eb"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/abhinavxd/libredesk/security/advisories/GHSA-wh6m-h6f4-rjf4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68927"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68927.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
