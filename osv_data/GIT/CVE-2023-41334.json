Version 5.3.2 of the Astropy core package is vulnerable to remote code execution due to improper input validation in the `TranformGraph().to_dot_graph` function. A malicious user can provide a command or a script file as a value to the `savelayout` argument, which will be placed as the first value in a list of arguments passed to `subprocess.Popen`.  Although an error will be raised, the command or script will be executed successfully. Version 5.3.3 fixes this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/astropy/astropy","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"22057d37b1313f5f5a9b5783df0a091d978dccb5"}]}],"versions":["v0.1","v0.2","v0.2b1","v0.2b2","v0.2rc1","v0.3b1","v0.3rc1","v0.4","v0.4rc1","v0.4rc2","v1.0rc1","v4.1.dev","v4.2.dev","v4.3.dev","v5.0.dev","v5.1.dev","v5.2.dev","v5.3","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.3.dev","v5.3rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-41334.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/astropy/astropy/security/advisories/GHSA-h2x6-5jx5-46hf"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/astropy/astropy/commit/22057d37b1313f5f5a9b5783df0a091d978dccb5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/9b97d98802ee4f5350a62b681c35d8687ee81d91/astropy/coordinates/transformations.py#L539"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-77"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
