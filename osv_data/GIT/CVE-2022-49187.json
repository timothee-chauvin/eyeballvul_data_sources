While never actually documented, this is evidenced by the wide\nusage of clk_register and clk_hw_register with a NULL device pointer,\nand the fact that the core of_clk_hw_register() function also passes a\nNULL device pointer.\n\nA call to clk_hw_get_clk() on a clk_hw struct whose clk_core is in that\ncase will result in a NULL pointer derefence when it calls dev_name() on\nthat NULL device pointer.\n\nAdd a test for this case and use NULL as the dev_id if the device\npointer is NULL.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"30d6f8c15d2cd877c1f3d47d8a1064649ebe58e2"},{"fixed":"4be3e4c05d8dd1b83b75652cad88c9e752ec7054"},{"fixed":"d183f20cf5a7b546d4108e796b98210ceb317579"},{"fixed":"23f89fe005b105f0dcc55034c13eb89f9b570fac"},{"fixed":"0c1b56df451716ba207bbf59f303473643eee4fd"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.4","v5.15.5","v5.15.6","v5.15.7","v5.15.8","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.16.1","v5.16.10","v5.16.11","v5.16.12","v5.16.13","v5.16.14","v5.16.15","v5.16.16","v5.16.17","v5.16.18","v5.16.2","v5.16.3","v5.16.4","v5.16.5","v5.16.6","v5.16.7","v5.16.8","v5.16.9","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.17.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49187.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.11.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.33"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.16.19"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"5.17.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49187.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0c1b56df451716ba207bbf59f303473643eee4fd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/23f89fe005b105f0dcc55034c13eb89f9b570fac"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4be3e4c05d8dd1b83b75652cad88c9e752ec7054"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d183f20cf5a7b546d4108e796b98210ceb317579"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49187.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49187"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49187.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
