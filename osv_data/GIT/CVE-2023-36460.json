Starting in version 3.5.0 and prior to versions 3.5.9, 4.0.5, and 4.1.3, attackers using carefully crafted media files can cause Mastodon's media processing code to create arbitrary files at any location. This allows attackers to create and overwrite any file Mastodon has access to, allowing Denial of Service and arbitrary Remote Code Execution. Versions 3.5.9, 4.0.5, and 4.1.3 contain a patch for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0d5781ca7609590a6d5340bb685bb1804056bb46"},{"fixed":"8d7f6550f91338fb69e5c6e0cd28653122784665"},{"fixed":"b10c974ba1952c545acff505bfd36feb0c60b000"},{"fixed":"dc8f1fbd976ae544720a4e07120d9a91b2722440"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.6","v0.7","v0.8","v0.9","v0.9.9","v1.0","v1.1","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.2","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.3","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.4.7","v1.4rc1","v1.4rc2","v1.4rc3","v1.4rc4","v1.4rc5","v1.4rc6","v1.5.0","v1.5.0rc1","v1.5.0rc2","v1.5.0rc3","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.0rc1","v1.6.0rc2","v1.6.0rc3","v1.6.0rc4","v1.6.0rc5","v1.6.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0rc1","v2.0.0rc2","v2.0.0rc3","v2.0.0rc4","v2.1.0","v2.1.0rc1","v2.1.0rc2","v2.1.0rc3","v2.1.0rc4","v2.1.0rc5","v2.1.0rc6","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.2.0","v2.2.0rc1","v2.2.0rc2","v2.3.0","v2.3.0rc1","v2.3.0rc2","v2.3.0rc3","v2.3.1","v2.3.1rc1","v2.3.1rc2","v2.3.1rc3","v2.3.2","v2.3.2rc1","v2.3.2rc2","v2.3.2rc3","v2.3.2rc4","v2.3.2rc5","v2.4.0","v2.4.0rc1","v2.4.0rc2","v2.4.0rc3","v2.4.0rc4","v2.4.0rc5","v2.4.1","v2.4.1rc1","v2.4.1rc2","v2.4.1rc3","v2.4.1rc4","v2.4.2","v2.4.2rc1","v2.4.2rc2","v2.4.2rc3","v2.4.3","v2.4.3rc1","v2.4.3rc2","v2.4.3rc3","v2.5.0","v2.5.0rc1","v2.5.0rc2","v2.6.0","v2.6.0rc1","v2.6.0rc2","v2.6.0rc3","v2.6.0rc4","v2.6.1","v2.7.0","v2.7.0rc1","v2.7.0rc2","v2.7.0rc3","v2.7.1","v2.8.0","v2.8.0rc1","v2.8.0rc2","v2.8.0rc3","v2.8.1","v2.8.2","v2.9.0","v2.9.0rc1","v2.9.0rc2","v2.9.1","v2.9.2","v3.0.0","v3.0.0rc1","v3.0.0rc2","v3.0.0rc3","v3.0.1","v3.1.0","v3.1.0rc1","v3.1.0rc2","v3.1.1","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.1.4","v3.2.0","v3.2.0rc1","v3.2.0rc2","v3.3.0","v3.3.0rc1","v3.3.0rc2","v3.3.0rc3","v3.4.0","v3.4.0rc1","v3.4.0rc2","v3.4.1","v3.5.0","v3.5.0rc1","v3.5.0rc2","v3.5.0rc3","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.5.3","v3.5.4","v3.5.5","v3.5.6","v3.5.7","v3.5.8","v4.0.0","v4.0.0rc1","v4.0.0rc2","v4.0.0rc3","v4.0.0rc4","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.1.0","v4.1.0rc1","v4.1.0rc2","v4.1.0rc3","v4.1.1","v4.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-36460.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon","events":[{"introduced":"8c7223f4eac80b5725485be742d3fa2c984f4670"},{"fixed":"b10c974ba1952c545acff505bfd36feb0c60b000"}]}],"versions":["v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.5.3","v3.5.4","v3.5.5","v3.5.6","v3.5.7","v3.5.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-36460.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/06/4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/36xxx/CVE-2023-36460.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/dc8f1fbd976ae544720a4e07120d9a91b2722440"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v3.5.9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.0.5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.1.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-9928-3cp5-93fm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36460"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/36xxx/CVE-2023-36460.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
