Several API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization. The main API endpoints affected by this are /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/, /api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/, and /api/v3/.../used_by/. Note that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable. authentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1a21479b0d14093633521137cdfff257bc667dd5"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2024.4.4"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik","events":[{"introduced":"35cd1264063c37ac1dd406eab98a1d1b7c31f3f0"},{"fixed":"8a0b31b9227ca33b96c5448f185419f17090ed38"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2024.6.0-rc1"},{"fixed":"2024.6.4"}]}}],"versions":["version/0.0.10-alpha","version/0.0.11-alpha","version/0.0.12-alpha","version/0.0.13-alpha","version/0.0.2-alpha","version/0.0.3-alpha","version/0.0.4-alpha","version/0.0.5-alpha","version/0.0.6-alpha","version/0.0.7-alpha","version/0.0.8-alpha","version/0.0.9-alpha","version/0.1.0-beta","version/0.1.1-beta","version/0.1.10-beta","version/0.1.11-beta","version/0.1.12-beta","version/0.1.13-beta","version/0.1.14-beta","version/0.1.15-beta","version/0.1.16-beta","version/0.1.17-beta","version/0.1.18-beta","version/0.1.19-beta","version/0.1.2-beta","version/0.1.20-beta","version/0.1.21-beta","version/0.1.22-beta","version/0.1.23-beta","version/0.1.24-beta","version/0.1.25-beta","version/0.1.26-beta","version/0.1.27-beta","version/0.1.28-beta","version/0.1.29-beta","version/0.1.3-beta","version/0.1.30-beta","version/0.1.31-beta","version/0.1.32-beta","version/0.1.33-beta","version/0.1.34-beta","version/0.1.35-beta","version/0.1.36-beta","version/0.1.37-beta","version/0.1.38-beta","version/0.1.4-beta","version/0.1.5-beta","version/0.1.6-beta","version/0.1.7-beta","version/0.1.8-beta","version/0.1.9-beta","version/0.10.0-rc1","version/0.10.0-rc2","version/0.10.0-rc3","version/0.10.0-rc4","version/0.10.0-rc5","version/0.10.0-rc6","version/0.10.0-stable","version/0.10.1-stable","version/0.10.2-stable","version/0.10.3-stable","version/0.10.4-stable","version/0.10.5-stable","version/0.10.6-stable","version/0.10.7-stable","version/0.10.8-stable","version/0.10.9-stable","version/0.11.0-stable","version/0.12.0-stable","version/0.12.1-stable","version/0.12.10-stable","version/0.12.11-stable","version/0.12.2-stable","version/0.12.3-stable","version/0.12.4-stable","version/0.12.5-stable","version/0.12.6-stable","version/0.12.7-stable","version/0.12.8-stable","version/0.12.9-stable","version/0.13.0-rc1","version/0.13.0-rc2","version/0.13.0-rc3","version/0.13.0-rc4","version/0.13.0-stable","version/0.13.1-stable","version/0.13.2-stable","version/0.13.3-stable","version/0.2.0-beta","version/0.2.1-beta","version/0.2.2-beta","version/0.2.3-beta","version/0.2.4-beta","version/0.2.5-beta","version/0.2.6-beta","version/0.2.7-beta","version/0.2.8-beta","version/0.3.0-beta","version/0.4.0-beta","version/0.4.1-beta","version/0.4.2-beta","version/0.5.0-beta","version/0.6.0-beta","version/0.6.1-beta","version/0.6.10-beta","version/0.6.11-beta","version/0.6.2-beta","version/0.6.3-beta","version/0.6.4-beta","version/0.6.5-beta","version/0.6.6-beta","version/0.6.7-beta","version/0.6.8-beta","version/0.6.9-beta","version/0.7.0-beta","version/0.7.1-beta","version/0.7.10-beta","version/0.7.11-beta","version/0.7.12-beta","version/0.7.13-beta","version/0.7.14-beta","version/0.7.15-beta","version/0.7.16-beta","version/0.7.17-beta","version/0.7.2-beta","version/0.7.3-beta","version/0.7.4-beta","version/0.7.5-beta","version/0.7.6-beta","version/0.7.7-beta","version/0.7.8-beta","version/0.7.9-beta","version/0.8.0-beta","version/0.8.1-beta","version/0.8.10-beta","version/0.8.11-beta","version/0.8.12-beta","version/0.8.14-beta","version/0.8.15-beta","version/0.8.2-beta","version/0.8.3-beta","version/0.8.4-beta","version/0.8.5-beta","version/0.8.6-beta","version/0.8.7-beta","version/0.8.8-beta","version/0.8.9-beta","version/0.9.0-pre1","version/0.9.0-pre2","version/0.9.0-pre3","version/0.9.0-pre4","version/0.9.0-pre5","version/0.9.0-pre6","version/0.9.0-pre7","version/0.9.0-rc1","version/0.9.0-rc2","version/0.9.0-stable","version/2021.1.1-rc1","version/2021.1.1-rc2","version/2021.1.1-stable","version/2021.1.2-stable","version/2021.1.3-stable","version/2021.1.4-stable","version/2021.10.1","version/2021.10.1-rc1","version/2021.10.1-rc2","version/2021.10.1-rc3","version/2021.10.2","version/2021.10.3","version/2021.10.4","version/2021.12.1","version/2021.12.1-rc1","version/2021.12.1-rc2","version/2021.12.1-rc3","version/2021.12.1-rc4","version/2021.12.1-rc5","version/2021.12.2","version/2021.12.3","version/2021.12.4","version/2021.12.5","version/2021.2.1-rc1","version/2021.2.1-rc2","version/2021.2.1-stable","version/2021.2.2-stable","version/2021.2.3-stable","version/2021.2.4-stable","version/2021.2.5-stable","version/2021.2.6-stable","version/2021.3.1","version/2021.3.1-rc1","version/2021.3.1-rc2","version/2021.3.2","version/2021.3.3","version/2021.3.4","version/2021.4.1","version/2021.4.1-rc1","version/2021.4.1-rc2","version/2021.4.2","version/2021.4.3","version/2021.4.4","version/2021.4.5","version/2021.5.1","version/2021.
