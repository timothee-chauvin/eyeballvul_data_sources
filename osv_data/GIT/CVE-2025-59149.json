In version 8.0.0, rules using keyword ldap.responses.attribute_type (which is long) with transforms can lead to a stack buffer overflow during Suricata startup or during a rule reload. This issue is fixed in version 8.0.1. To workaround this issue, users can disable rules with ldap.responses.attribute_type and transforms.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oisf/suricata","events":[{"introduced":"9956286fb89f9cad9e9f95b99dc751f8666617b7"},{"fixed":"2444feed0d5ff5beb52e4d6e1f7ece487f3de179"}]}],"versions":["suricata-8.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59149.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-vxcg-38x4-gj7j"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/38a2cba5c397002047d84645f5ab770ff88020e1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://forum.suricata.io/t/suricata-8-0-1-and-7-0-12-released/6018"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7861"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-121"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
