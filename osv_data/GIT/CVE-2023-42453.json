{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-42453","published":"2023-09-26T20:49:23Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:40:36.063533Z","aliases":["GHSA-7565-cq32-vx2x","PYSEC-2023-180"],"related":["openSUSE-SU-2024:13270-1"],"summary":"Improper validation of receipts allows forged read receipts in matrix synapse","details":"Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. Users were able to forge read receipts for any event (if they knew the room ID and event ID). Note that the users were not able to view the events, but simply mark it as read. This could be confusing as clients will show the event as read by the user, even if they are not in the room. This issue has been patched in version 1.93.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse","events":[{"introduced":"d731b75c7bcada708f1acbb83e2521da6a7d97a9"},{"fixed":"88ba67eb91215a708f321e16559fe3c2c0d0a407"}]}],"versions":["1.7.2","v0.34.0","v0.34.1","v0.34.1+1","v0.34.1.1","v0.34.1rc1","v0.99.0","v0.99.0rc1","v0.99.0rc2","v0.99.0rc3","v0.99.0rc4","v0.99.1","v0.99.1.1","v0.99.1rc1","v0.99.1rc2","v0.99.2","v0.99.2rc1","v0.99.3","v0.99.3.1","v0.99.3.2","v0.99.3rc1","v0.99.4","v0.99.4rc1","v0.99.5","v0.99.5.1","v0.99.5.1.dev0","v0.99.5.2","v0.99.5rc1","v1.0.0","v1.0.0rc1","v1.0.0rc2","v1.0.0rc3","v1.1.0","v1.1.0rc1","v1.1.0rc2","v1.10.0","v1.10.0rc1","v1.10.0rc2","v1.10.0rc3","v1.10.0rc5","v1.10.1","v1.11.0","v1.11.0rc1","v1.11.1","v1.12.0","v1.12.0rc1","v1.12.1","v1.12.1rc1","v1.12.2","v1.12.3","v1.12.4","v1.12.4rc1","v1.13.0","v1.13.0rc1","v1.13.0rc2","v1.13.0rc3","v1.14.0","v1.14.0rc1","v1.14.0rc2","v1.15.0","v1.15.0rc1","v1.15.1","v1.15.2","v1.16.0","v1.16.0rc1","v1.16.0rc2","v1.16.1","v1.17.0","v1.17.0rc1","v1.18.0","v1.18.0rc1","v1.18.0rc2","v1.19.0","v1.19.0rc1","v1.19.1","v1.19.1rc1","v1.19.2","v1.19.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.0rc1","v1.2.0rc2","v1.2.1","v1.20.0","v1.20.0rc1","v1.20.0rc2","v1.20.0rc3","v1.20.0rc4","v1.20.0rc5","v1.20.1","v1.21.0","v1.21.0rc1","v1.21.0rc2","v1.21.0rc3","v1.21.1","v1.21.2","v1.22.0","v1.22.0rc1","v1.22.0rc2","v1.22.1","v1.23.0","v1.23.0rc1","v1.23.1","v1.24.0","v1.24.0rc1","v1.24.0rc2","v1.25.0","v1.25.0rc1","v1.26.0","v1.26.0-deb","v1.26.0rc1","v1.26.0rc2","v1.27.0","v1.27.0rc1","v1.27.0rc2","v1.28.0","v1.28.0rc1","v1.29.0","v1.29.0rc1","v1.3.0","v1.3.0rc1","v1.3.1","v1.30.0","v1.30.0rc1","v1.30.1","v1.31.0","v1.31.0rc1","v1.32.0","v1.32.0rc1","v1.32.1","v1.32.2","v1.33.0","v1.33.0rc1","v1.33.0rc2","v1.33.1","v1.33.2","v1.34.0","v1.34.0rc1","v1.35.0","v1.35.0rc1","v1.35.0rc2","v1.35.1","v1.36.0","v1.36.0rc1","v1.36.0rc2","v1.37.0","v1.37.0rc1","v1.37.1","v1.37.1a1","v1.37.1rc1","v1.38.0","v1.38.0rc1","v1.38.0rc2","v1.38.0rc3","v1.38.1","v1.39.0","v1.39.0rc1","v1.39.0rc2","v1.39.0rc3","v1.4.0","v1.4.0rc1","v1.4.0rc2","v1.4.1","v1.4.1rc1","v1.40.0","v1.40.0rc1","v1.40.0rc2","v1.40.0rc3","v1.41.0","v1.41.0rc1","v1.41.1","v1.42.0","v1.42.0rc1","v1.42.0rc2","v1.43.0","v1.43.0rc1","v1.43.0rc2","v1.44.0","v1.44.0rc1","v1.44.0rc2","v1.44.0rc3","v1.45.0","v1.45.0rc1","v1.45.0rc2","v1.45.1","v1.46.0","v1.46.0rc1","v1.47.0","v1.47.0rc1","v1.47.0rc2","v1.47.0rc3","v1.47.1","v1.48.0","v1.48.0rc1","v1.49.0","v1.49.0rc1","v1.49.1","v1.49.2","v1.5.0","v1.5.0rc1","v1.5.0rc2","v1.5.1","v1.50.0","v1.50.0rc1","v1.50.0rc2","v1.50.1","v1.50.2","v1.51.0","v1.51.0rc1","v1.51.0rc2","v1.52.0","v1.52.0rc1","v1.53.0","v1.53.0rc1","v1.54.0","v1.54.0rc1","v1.55.0","v1.55.0rc1","v1.55.1","v1.55.2","v1.56.0","v1.56.0rc1","v1.57.0","v1.57.0rc1","v1.57.1","v1.58.0","v1.58.0rc1","v1.58.0rc2","v1.58.1","v1.59.0","v1.59.0rc1","v1.59.0rc2","v1.59.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.0rc1","v1.6.0rc2","v1.6.1","v1.60.0","v1.60.0rc1","v1.60.0rc2","v1.61.0","v1.61.0rc1","v1.61.1","v1.62.0","v1.62.0rc1","v1.62.0rc2","v1.62.0rc3","v1.63.0","v1.63.0rc1","v1.63.1","v1.64.0","v1.64.0rc1","v1.64.0rc2","v1.65.0","v1.65.0rc1","v1.65.0rc2","v1.66.0","v1.66.0rc1","v1.66.0rc2","v1.67.0","v1.67.0rc1","v1.68.0","v1.68.0rc1","v1.68.0rc2","v1.69.0","v1.69.0rc1","v1.69.0rc2","v1.69.0rc3","v1.69.0rc4","v1.7.0","v1.7.0rc1","v1.7.0rc2","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.70.0","v1.70.0rc1","v1.70.0rc2","v1.70.1","v1.71.0","v1.71.0rc1","v1.71.0rc2","v1.72.0","v1.72.0rc1","v1.73.0","v1.73.0rc1","v1.73.0rc2","v1.74.0","v1.74.0rc1","v1.75.0","v1.75.0rc1","v1.75.0rc2","v1.76.0","v1.76.0rc1","v1.76.0rc2","v1.77.0","v1.77.0rc1","v1.77.0rc2","v1.78.0","v1.78.0rc1","v1.79.0","v1.79.0rc1","v1.79.0rc2","v1.8.0","v1.8.0rc1","v1.80.0","v1.80.0rc1","v1.80.0rc2","v1.81.0","v1.81.0rc1","v1.81.0rc2","v1.82.0","v1.82.0rc1","v1.83.0","v1.83.0rc1","v1.84.0","v1.84.0rc1","v1.84.1","v1.85.0","v1.85.0rc1","v1.85.0rc2","v1.85.1","v1.85.2","v1.86.0","v1.86.0rc1","v1.86.0rc2","v1.87.0","v1.87.0rc1","v1.88.0","v1.88.0rc1","v1.89.0","v1.89.0rc1","v1.9.0","v1.9.0.dev1","v1.9.0.dev2","v1.9.0rc1","v1.9.1","v1.90.0","v1.90.0rc1","v1.91.0","v1.91.0rc1","v1.91.1","v1.91.2","v1.92.0","v1.92.0rc1","v1.92.1","v1.92.2","v1.92.3","v1.93.0rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-42453.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-7565-cq32-vx2x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-12"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16327"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2AFB2Y3S2VCPCN5P2XCZTG24MBMZ7DM4/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/65QPC55I4D27HIZP7H2NQ34EOXHPP4AO/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announc
