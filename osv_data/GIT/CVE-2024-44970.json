For SHAMPO, it is possible\nto receive CQEs with 0 consumed strides for the same WQE even after the\nWQE is fully consumed and unlinked. This triggers an additional unlink\nfor the same wqe which corrupts the linked list.\n\nFix this scenario by accepting 0 sized consumed strides without\nunlinking the WQE
