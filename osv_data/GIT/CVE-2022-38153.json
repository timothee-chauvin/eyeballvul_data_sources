{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-38153","published":"2022-08-31T18:15:08.750Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:09:20.317923Z","details":"An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0 (when --enable-session-ticket is used); however, only version 5.3.0 is exploitable. Man-in-the-middle attackers or a malicious server can crash TLS 1.2 clients during a handshake. If an attacker injects a large ticket (more than 256 bytes) into a NewSessionTicket message in a TLS 1.2 handshake, and the client has a non-empty session cache, the session cache frees a pointer that points to unallocated memory, causing the client to crash with a \"free(): invalid pointer\" message. NOTE: It is likely that this is also exploitable during TLS 1.3 handshakes between a client and a malicious server. With TLS 1.3, it is not possible to exploit this as a man-in-the-middle.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"e722c15be860794179082a05d09e6a90dc77ccf0"}]}],"versions":["WCv4-rng-stable","WCv4-stable","WCv4.0-RC5","WCv4.0-RC6","WCv4.0-RC8","WCv4.0-RC9","WCv5.0-RC10","WCv5.0-RC11","WCv5.0-RC12","WCv5.0-RC9","l","list","v0.5","v1.8.8.0","v1.9.0","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.6","v2.0.8","v2.0rc1","v2.0rc2","v2.0rc2b","v2.0rc3","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.4","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v2.4.2","v2.4.6","v2.4.7","v2.5.0","v2.5.2","v2.5.2b","v2.6.0","v2.6.2","v2.7.0","v2.7.2","v2.8.0","v2.8.2","v2.8.3","v2.8.4","v2.8.5","v2.8.5a","v2.8.6","v2.9.0","v2.9.1","v2.9.2","v2.9.4","v3.0.0","v3.0.2","v3.1.0","v3.10.0-stable","v3.10.0a","v3.10.2-stable","v3.10.3","v3.10.4","v3.11.0-stable","v3.11.1-tls13-beta","v3.12.0-stable","v3.12.2-stable","v3.13.0-stable","v3.13.2","v3.13.3","v3.14.0-stable","v3.14.0a","v3.14.0b","v3.14.2","v3.14.4","v3.14.5","v3.15.0-stable","v3.15.3-stable","v3.15.5-stable","v3.15.5a","v3.15.6","v3.15.7-stable","v3.15.8","v3.2.0","v3.2.4","v3.2.6","v3.3.0","v3.3.3","v3.4.0","v3.4.2","v3.4.6","v3.4.8","v3.6.0","v3.6.0b","v3.6.2","v3.6.6","v3.6.8","v3.6.9","v3.6.9b","v3.6.9c","v3.6.9d","v3.69.d","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.7.3","v3.8.0","v3.9.0","v3.9.1","v3.9.10-stable","v3.9.10b","v3.9.6","v3.9.6w","v3.9.8","v4.0.0-stable","v4.1.0-stable","v4.2.0-stable","v4.2.0c","v4.3.0-stable","v4.4.0-stable","v4.5.0-stable","v4.6.0-stable","v4.7.0-stable","v4.7.1r","v4.8.0-stable","v5.0.0-stable","v5.1.0-stable","v5.2.0-stable","v5.3.0-stable","wolfRand-RC2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-38153.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170605/wolfSSL-5.3.0-Denial-Of-Service.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jan/8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/01/12/wolfssl-vulnerabilities-tlspuffin-fuzzing-ssh/"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/5476"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/security-vulnerabilities/"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/trailofbits/tlspuffin"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
