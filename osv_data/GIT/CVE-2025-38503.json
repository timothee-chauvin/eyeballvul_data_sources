It also means\nthis is the block group with the highest start offset, so there are no\nhigher keys in the extent root, hence btrfs_search_slot_for_read()\nreturns 1 (no higher key found).\n\nFix this by asserting 'ret' is 0 only if the block group tree feature\nis not enabled, in which case we should find a block group item for\nthe block group since it's stored in the extent root and block group\nitem keys are greater than extent item keys (the value for\nBTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_ITEM_KEY is 192 and for BTRFS_EXTENT_ITEM_KEY and\nBTRFS_METADATA_ITEM_KEY the values are 168 and 169 respectively).\nIn case 'ret' is 1, we just need to add a record to the free space\ntree which spans the whole block group, and we can achieve this by\nmaking 'ret == 0' as the while loop's
