The code attempts to select a less-often-used cache entry by means of a random number generator, but this is not done correctly. Remote code execution might be a slight possibility.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"66fa7c959a53cff27c83e7f10331ad24cfdfb0a4"}]}],"versions":["4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.0.4","4.0.5","4.0.6","4.0.7","4.1.0","4.1.1","4.1.10","4.1.11","4.1.2","4.1.3","4.1.4","4.1.5","4.1.6","4.1.7","4.1.8","4.1.9","4.2.0","4.2.1","4.2.10","4.2.11","4.2.12","4.2.13","4.2.14","4.2.2","4.2.3","4.2.4","4.2.5","4.2.6","4.2.7","4.2.8","4.2.9","4.3.0","4.3.1","4.3.2","4.3.3","4.3.4","4.3.5","4.3.5rc1","4.3.6","4.4.0","4.4.1","4.5.0","4.5.1","4.5.2","4.5.3","4.6.0","4.6.1","4.6.2","4.6.3","5.0.0","5.0.1","5.0.2","5.0.2dr4","5.0.2rc1","5.0.3","5.0.3dr1","5.0.3dr2","5.0.3dr3","5.0.3rc1","5.0.4","5.1.0","5.1.0dr1","5.1.0dr2","5.1.0rc1","5.1.1","5.1.1dr1","5.1.1dr2","5.1.1dr3","5.1.1dr4","5.1.1rc1","5.1.2","5.1.2.dr2","5.1.2dr1","5.1.2dr3","5.1.2rc1","5.1.2rc2","5.1.3","5.1.3dr1","5.1.3rc1","5.2.0","5.2.0dr1","5.2.0dr2","5.2.0dr3","5.2.0dr4","5.2.0dr5","5.2.0dr6","5.2.0rc1","5.2.1","5.2.1dr1","5.2.1rc1","5.2.2","5.2.2dr1","5.2.2rc1","5.3.0","5.3.0dr1","5.3.0rc1","5.3.1","5.3.1dr1","5.3.1rc1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.3.3dr1","5.3.3dr3","5.3.3dr4","5.3.3dr5","5.3.3dr6","5.3.3rc2","5.3.4","5.3.4dr1","5.3.4dr2","5.3.4dr3","5.3.4rc1","5.3.5","5.4.0","5.4.0dr1","5.4.0dr2","5.4.0dr3","5.4.0dr4","5.4.0dr5","5.4.0dr6","5.4.0dr7","5.4.0dr8","5.4.0rc1","5.4.1dr1","5.4.1dr2","5.4.1dr3","5.4.1dr4","5.5.0","5.5.0dr1","5.5.0rc1","5.5.1","5.5.1dr1","5.5.1dr2","5.5.1dr3","5.5.1dr4","5.5.1dr5","5.5.1rc1","5.5.1rc2","5.5.2","5.5.2dr1","5.5.2dr2","5.5.2dr3","5.5.2dr4","5.5.2dr5","5.5.2dr6","5.5.2dr7","5.5.2rc1","5.5.3","5.5.3dr1","5.5.3dr2","5.6.0","5.6.0dr1","5.6.0dr2","5.6.0dr3","5.6.0dr4","5.6.0rc1","5.6.0rc2","5.6.1","5.6.1dr1","5.6.1dr2","5.6.1dr3","5.6.1rc1","5.6.2","5.6.2dr1","5.6.2dr2","5.6.2dr3","5.6.2dr4","5.6.2rc1","5.6.3","5.6.3dr1","5.6.3dr2","5.6.3rc1","5.7.0","5.7.0dr1","5.7.0dr2","5.7.0dr3","5.7.0dr4","5.7.0dr5","5.7.0dr6","5.7.0dr8","5.7.0rc1","5.7.0rc2","5.7.1","5.7.2","5.7.2dr1","5.7.2dr2","5.7.2dr3","5.7.2dr4","5.7.2rc1","5.8.0","5.8.0dr2","5.8.0rc1","5.8.1","5.8.1dr1","5.8.1rc2","5.8.2","5.8.2dr1","5.8.2dr2","5.8.2rc1","5.8.2rc2","5.8.3","5.8.3rc1","5.8.4","5.9.0","5.9.0dr1","5.9.0dr2","5.9.0rc1","5.9.1","5.9.1dr1","5.9.1rc1","5.9.2","5.9.2dr1","5.9.2dr2","5.9.2rc1","5.9.2rc2","5.9.3","5.9.3dr1","5.9.3dr2","5.9.3dr3","5.9.3dr4","5.9.3rc1","5.9.4dr1","5.9.4dr2","5.9.4dr3","5.9.4rc1","android-2.3.3","android-2.3.3-1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-41991.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5FJSATD2R2XHTG4P63GCMQ2N7EWKMME5/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WQSQ3BEC22NF4NCDZVCT4P3Q2ZIAJXGJ/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Y3TQ32JLJOBJDB2EJKSX2PBPB5NFG2D4/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-539476.pdf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/releases/tag/5.9.4"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/10/msg00014.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4989"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://www.strongswan.org/blog/2021/10/18/strongswan-vulnerability-%28cve-2021-41991%29.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
