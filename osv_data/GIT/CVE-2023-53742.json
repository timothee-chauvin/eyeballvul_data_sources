In terms of generated code this currently\nonly affects architectures that do not use the default READ_ONCE()\nimplementation.\n\nThe only downside is that we are not guaranteed atomicity of the access\nitself, although on most architectures a plain load up to machine word\nsize should still be atomic (a fact the default READ_ONCE() still relies\non
