A specially crafted HTTP If-None-Match header can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking, when on a version of Ruby below 3.2.0. This can cause the process to use large amounts of CPU and memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rails/rails","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c443466a99f8ed951605fb4993a01de5e41349a4"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.14.1","v0.14.3","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.4.1","v0.9.5","v1.1.0","v1.1.0_RC1","v1.1.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0_PR","v2.0.0_RC1","v2.0.0_RC2","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.1.0_RC1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.2.1","v3.0.0.beta.2","v3.0.0.beta.3","v3.0.0.beta1","v3.0.0.beta2","v3.0.0.beta3","v3.0.0.beta4","v3.0.0_RC","v3.1.0.beta1","v3.1.0.rc1","v3.2.0.rc1","v4.0.0.beta1","v4.0.0.rc1","v4.1.0.beta1","v4.1.0.beta2","v4.2.0.beta1","v4.2.0.beta4","v5.0.0.beta1","v5.0.0.beta1.1","v5.0.0.beta2","v5.0.0.beta3","v5.0.0.beta4","v5.0.0.rc1","v5.1.0.beta1","v6.0.0.beta1","v6.0.0.beta2","v6.0.0.beta3","v6.1.0","v6.1.0.rc1","v6.1.0.rc2","v6.1.1","v6.1.2","v6.1.2.1","v6.1.3","v6.1.3.1","v6.1.3.2","v6.1.4","v6.1.4.1","v6.1.4.2","v6.1.4.3","v6.1.4.4","v6.1.4.5","v6.1.4.6","v6.1.4.7","v6.1.5","v6.1.5.1","v6.1.6","v6.1.6.1","v6.1.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-22795.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/cve-2023-22795-possible-redos-based-dos-vulnerability-in-action-dispatch/82118"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240202-0010/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5372"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
