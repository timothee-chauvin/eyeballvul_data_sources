This is due to missing nonce validation on the set_subscription_level() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the subscription settings of authenticated users via a forged request granted they can trick a logged-in user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asgaros/asgaros-forum","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"92305fb8ba4ec0a6c65256915d0a32e5553b74f3"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.10","v1.0.11","v1.0.12","v1.0.13","v1.0.14","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.13.3","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.14.10","v1.14.11","v1.14.12","v1.14.13","v1.14.14","v1.14.15","v1.14.2","v1.14.3","v1.14.4","v1.14.5","v1.14.6","v1.14.7","v1.14.8","v1.14.9","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.15.10","v1.15.11","v1.15.12","v1.15.13","v1.15.14","v1.15.15","v1.15.16","v1.15.17","v1.15.18","v1.15.19","v1.15.2","v1.15.20","v1.15.3","v1.15.4","v1.15.5","v1.15.6","v1.15.7","v1.15.8","v1.15.9","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.2.9","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.10","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.5.6","v1.5.7","v1.5.8","v1.5.9","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v1.9.6","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.7.2","v2.8.0","v2.9.0","v3.0.0","v3.1.0","v3.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-12901.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/asgaros-forum/tags/3.2.1/includes/forum-notifications.php#L605"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/asgaros-forum/tags/3.2.1/includes/forum-notifications.php#L606"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3392004%40asgaros-forum&new=3392004%40asgaros-forum&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/75625e6e-f75b-4e11-acd8-7388efb12b29?source=cve"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Asgaros/asgaros-forum/commit/92305fb8ba4ec0a6c65256915d0a32e5553b74f3"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
