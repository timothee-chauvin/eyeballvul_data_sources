When two\nSMC calls are in sleep and one SMC wakes up, it calls get_wq_ctx() to\nresume the corresponding sleeping thread. But if get_wq_ctx() is\ninterrupted, goes to sleep and another SMC call is waiting to be allocated\na waitq context, it leads to a deadlock.\n\nTo avoid this get_wq_ctx() must be an atomic call and can't be a standard\nSMC call. Hence mark get_wq_ctx() as a fast call.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"6bf32599223634294cdc6efb359ffaab1d68073c"},{"fixed":"cdf7efe4b02aa93813db0bf1ca596ad298ab6b06"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"6bf32599223634294cdc6efb359ffaab1d68073c"},{"fixed":"e40115c33c0d79c940545b6b12112aace7acd9f5"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"6bf32599223634294cdc6efb359ffaab1d68073c"},{"fixed":"9960085a3a82c58d3323c1c20b991db6045063b0"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.10.1","v6.10.2","v6.10.3","v6.10.4","v6.10.5","v6.10.6","v6.10.7","v6.11-rc1","v6.2","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.5","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-46692.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.3.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.49"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.10.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-46692.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9960085a3a82c58d3323c1c20b991db6045063b0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cdf7efe4b02aa93813db0bf1ca596ad298ab6b06"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e40115c33c0d79c940545b6b12112aace7acd9f5"}]}
