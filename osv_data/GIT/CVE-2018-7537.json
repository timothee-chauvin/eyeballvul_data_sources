If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods were passed the html=True argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression. The chars() and words() methods are used to implement the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters, which were thus vulnerable.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/django/django","events":[{"introduced":"6a0dc2176f4ebf907e124d433411e52bba39a28e"},{"fixed":"c686dd8e6bb3817bcf04b8f13c025b4d3c3dc6dc"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-7537.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103357"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2927"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0265"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/03/msg00006.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/3591-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4161"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2018/mar/06/security-releases/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
