This is true for other userspace applications which use seccomp\nto control their syscall surface.\n\nSince uretprobe is a \"kernel implementation detail\" system call which is\nnot used by userspace application code directly, it is impractical and\nthere's very little point in forcing all userspace applications to\nexplicitly allow it in order to avoid crashing tracked processes.\n\nPass this systemcall through seccomp without depending on configuration.\n\nNote: uretprobe is currently only x86_64 and isn't expected to ever be\nsupported in i386.\n\n[kees: minimized changes for easier backporting, tweaked commit log]","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ff474a78cef5cb5f32be52fe25b78441327a2e7c"},{"fixed":"5a262628f4cf2437d863fe41f9d427177b87664c"},{"fixed":"fa80018aa5be10c35e9fa896b7b4061a8dce3eed"},{"fixed":"cf6cb56ef24410fb5308f9655087f1eddf4452e6"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.13.1","v6.13.2","v6.14-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21834.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.11.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.14"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.13.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21834.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5a262628f4cf2437d863fe41f9d427177b87664c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cf6cb56ef24410fb5308f9655087f1eddf4452e6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fa80018aa5be10c35e9fa896b7b4061a8dce3eed"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/21xxx/CVE-2025-21834.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21834"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/21xxx/CVE-2025-21834.json"}}
