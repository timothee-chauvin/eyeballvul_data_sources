An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"18750294a76ff6c0f3f1b6af4ac1a23399836b16"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-4779.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/18750294a76ff6c0f3f1b6af4ac1a23399836b16"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/c603b64e-5171-4eed-8983-a7f656ce2c4d"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
