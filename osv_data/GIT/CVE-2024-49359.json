{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-49359","published":"2024-10-24T21:33:07.687Z","modified":"2025-12-05T06:42:20.956446Z","aliases":["GHSA-mwpw-fhrm-728x"],"summary":"ZimaOS vulnerable to Directory Listing via Parameter Manipulation","details":"ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v2_1/file` in ZimaOS is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing authenticated users to list the contents of any directory on the server. By manipulating the path parameter, attackers can access sensitive system directories such as `/etc`, potentially exposing critical configuration files and increasing the risk of further attacks. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/icewhaletech/zimaos","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"6a1d2ad717ee2833a4d0e400ab776a4a99fef6a7"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.2.4"}]}}],"versions":["0.4.8","0.4.8.1","0.4.9","0.4.9.1","0.4.9.2","0.4.9.3","0.4.9.4","0.5.0","1.0.0","1.1.0","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.3-beta1","1.2.4","1.2.4-beta1","1.2.4-beta2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-49359.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/49xxx/CVE-2024-49359.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-mwpw-fhrm-728x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49359"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://youtu.be/IuaEH09ot9s"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-552"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/49xxx/CVE-2024-49359.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
