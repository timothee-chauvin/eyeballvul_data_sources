In affected versions an attacker can read from outside of bounds of heap allocated data by sending specially crafted illegal arguments to `tf.raw_ops.UpperBound`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/searchsorted_op.cc#L85-L104) does not validate the rank of `sorted_input` argument. A similar issue occurs in `tf.raw_ops.LowerBound`. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 42459e4273c2e47a3232cc16c4f4fff3b3a35c38. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"42459e4273c2e47a3232cc16c4f4fff3b3a35c38"}]}],"versions":["0.12.0-rc0","0.12.0-rc1","0.12.1","0.5.0","0.6.0","v0.10.0","v0.10.0rc0","v0.11.0","v0.11.0rc0","v0.11.0rc1","v0.11.0rc2","v0.12.0","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0rc0","v0.9.0","v0.9.0rc0","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-alpha","v1.0.0-rc0","v1.0.0-rc1","v1.0.0-rc2","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc0","v1.1.0-rc1","v1.1.0-rc2","v1.12.0","v1.12.0-rc0","v1.12.0-rc1","v1.12.0-rc2","v1.12.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc0","v1.2.0-rc1","v1.2.0-rc2","v1.3.0-rc0","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-rc0","v1.5.0-rc1","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc0","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.8.0","v1.8.0-rc0","v1.8.0-rc1","v1.9.0","v1.9.0-rc0","v1.9.0-rc1","v1.9.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-37670.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["217598485465480210282593333328729280610","258447870997312984747646919551067192535","70091910491796889662803071888701853199","217598485465480210282593333328729280610","258447870997312984747646919551067192535","70091910491796889662803071888701853199"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2021-37670-d8b25ec9","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/42459e4273c2e47a3232cc16c4f4fff3b3a35c38","target":{"file":"tensorflow/core/kernels/searchsorted_op.cc"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/42459e4273c2e47a3232cc16c4f4fff3b3a35c38"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-9697-98pf-4rw7"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
