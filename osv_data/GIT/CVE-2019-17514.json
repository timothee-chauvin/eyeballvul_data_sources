{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2019-17514","published":"2019-10-12T13:15:10.790Z","modified":"2025-11-20T11:00:34.024801Z","related":["MGASA-2020-0451"],"details":"library/glob.html in the Python 2 and 3 documentation before 2016 has potentially misleading information about whether sorting occurs, as demonstrated by irreproducible cancer-research results. NOTE: the effects of this documentation cross application domains, and thus it is likely that security-relevant code elsewhere is affected. This issue is not a Python implementation bug, and there are no reports that NMR researchers were specifically relying on library/glob.html. In other words, because the older documentation stated \"finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell,\" one might have incorrectly inferred that the sorting that occurs in a Unix shell also occurred for glob.glob. There is a workaround in newer versions of Willoughby nmr-data_compilation-p2.py and nmr-data_compilation-p3.py, which call sort() directly.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/python/cpython","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1bf9cc509326bc42cd8cb1650eb9bf64550d817e"},{"last_affected":"5c4568a05a0a62b5947c55f68f9f2ecfb90a4f12"},{"last_affected":"fa919fdf2583bdfead1df00e842f24f30b2a34bf"}]}],"versions":["2.5","3.2","v0.9.8","v0.9.9","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1","v1.1.1","v1.2","v1.2b1","v1.2b2","v1.2b3","v1.2b4","v1.3","v1.3b1","v1.4","v1.4b1","v1.4b2","v1.4b3","v1.5","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.2a1","v1.5.2a2","v1.5.2b1","v1.5.2b2","v1.5.2c1","v1.5a1","v1.5a2","v1.5a3","v1.5a4","v1.5b1","v1.5b2","v1.6a1","v1.6a2","v2.0","v2.0b1","v2.0b2","v2.0c1","v2.1","v2.1a1","v2.1a2","v2.1b1","v2.1b2","v2.1c1","v2.1c2","v2.2a3","v2.3c1","v2.3c2","v2.4","v2.4a1","v2.4a2","v2.4a3","v2.4b1","v2.4b2","v2.4c1","v2.5","v2.5.1","v2.5.1c1","v2.5.2","v2.5.2c1","v2.5.3","v2.5.3c1","v2.5.4","v2.5.5","v2.5.5c1","v2.5.5c2","v2.5.6","v2.5.6c1","v2.5a0","v2.5a1","v2.5a2","v2.5b1","v2.5b2","v2.5b3","v2.5c1","v2.5c2","v2.6","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.6.2c1","v2.6.3","v2.6.3rc1","v2.6.4","v2.6.4rc1","v2.6.4rc2","v2.6.5","v2.6.5rc1","v2.6.5rc2","v2.6.6","v2.6.6rc1","v2.6.6rc2","v2.6.7","v2.6.8","v2.6.8rc1","v2.6.8rc2","v2.6a1","v2.6a2","v2.6a3","v2.6b1","v2.6b2","v2.6b3","v2.6rc1","v2.6rc2","v2.7","v2.7.1","v2.7.1rc1","v2.7.2","v2.7.2rc1","v2.7.3","v2.7.3rc1","v2.7.3rc2","v2.7.4rc1","v2.7a1","v2.7a2","v2.7a3","v2.7a4","v2.7b1","v2.7b2","v2.7rc1","v2.7rc2","v3.0a1","v3.0a2","v3.0a3","v3.0a4","v3.0a5","v3.0b1","v3.0b2","v3.0b3","v3.0rc1","v3.0rc2","v3.0rc3","v3.1","v3.1.1","v3.1.1rc1","v3.1.2","v3.1.2rc1","v3.1.3","v3.1.3rc1","v3.1.4","v3.1.4rc1","v3.1.5","v3.1.5rc1","v3.1.5rc2","v3.1a1","v3.1a2","v3.1b1","v3.1rc1","v3.1rc2","v3.2","v3.2.1","v3.2.1b1","v3.2.1rc1","v3.2.1rc2","v3.2.2","v3.2.2rc1","v3.2.3","v3.2.3rc1","v3.2.3rc2","v3.2.4","v3.2.4rc1","v3.2.5","v3.2.6","v3.2.6rc1","v3.2a1","v3.2a2","v3.2a3","v3.2a4","v3.2b1","v3.2b2","v3.2rc1","v3.2rc2","v3.2rc3","v3.3.0","v3.3.0a1","v3.3.0a2","v3.3.0a3","v3.3.0a4","v3.3.0b1","v3.3.0b2","v3.3.0rc1","v3.3.0rc2","v3.3.0rc3","v3.3.1","v3.3.1rc1","v3.3.2","v3.3.3","v3.3.3rc1","v3.3.3rc2","v3.3.4","v3.3.4rc1","v3.3.5","v3.3.5rc1","v3.3.5rc2","v3.3.6","v3.3.6rc1","v3.4.0","v3.4.0a1","v3.4.0a2","v3.4.0a3","v3.4.0a4","v3.4.0b1","v3.4.0b2","v3.4.0b3","v3.4.0rc1","v3.4.0rc2","v3.4.0rc3","v3.4.1","v3.4.1rc1","v3.4.2","v3.4.2rc1","v3.4.3","v3.4.3rc1","v3.4.4","v3.4.4rc1","v3.4.5","v3.4.5rc1","v3.5.0","v3.5.0a1","v3.5.0a2","v3.5.0a3","v3.5.0a4","v3.5.0b1","v3.5.0b2","v3.5.0b3","v3.5.0b4","v3.5.0rc1","v3.5.0rc2","v3.5.0rc3","v3.5.0rc4","v3.5.1","v3.5.1rc1","v3.5.2","v3.5.2rc1","v3.6.0","v3.6.0a1","v3.6.0a2","v3.6.0a3","v3.6.0a4","v3.6.0b1","v3.6.0b2","v3.6.0b3","v3.6.0b4","v3.6.0rc1","v3.6.0rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-17514.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4428-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmjwda/a-code-glitch-may-have-caused-errors-in-more-than-100-published-studies"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugs.python.org/issue33275"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/ac50fbac377e32b98d2de396f016ea81e8ee9961/pathexp.c#L380"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/ac50fbac377e32b98d2de396f016ea81e8ee9961/pathexp.c#L405"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.orglett.9b03216"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.orglett.9b03216/suppl_file/ol9b03216_si_002.zip"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191107-0005/"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://twitter.com/LucasCMoore/status/1181615421922824192"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://twitter.com/chris_bloke/status/1181997278136958976"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20150822013622/https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20150906020027/https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/glob.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20160309211341/https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20160526201356/https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/glob.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
