This attack appear to be exploitable via the victim opening an electron protocol handler in their browser. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in Electron 1.8.2-beta.5. This issue is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-1000006, specifically the black list used was not case insensitive allowing an attacker to potentially bypass it.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/electron/electron","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ce361a12e355f9e1e99c989f1ea056c9e502dbe7"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.10.3","v0.10.4","v0.10.5","v0.10.6","v0.10.7","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.11.10","v0.11.2","v0.11.3","v0.11.4","v0.11.5","v0.11.6","v0.11.7","v0.11.8","v0.11.9","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.12.3","v0.12.4","v0.12.5","v0.12.6","v0.12.7","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.13.3","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.15.3","v0.15.4","v0.15.5","v0.15.6","v0.15.7","v0.15.8","v0.15.9","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.16.3","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.18.2","v0.19.0","v0.19.1","v0.19.2","v0.19.3","v0.19.4","v0.19.5","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.20.2","v0.20.3","v0.20.4","v0.20.5","v0.20.6","v0.20.7","v0.20.8","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.21.2","v0.21.3","v0.22.0","v0.22.1","v0.22.2","v0.22.3","v0.23.0","v0.24.0","v0.25.0","v0.25.1","v0.25.2","v0.25.3","v0.26.0","v0.26.1","v0.27.0","v0.27.1","v0.27.2","v0.27.3","v0.28.0","v0.28.1","v0.28.2","v0.28.3","v0.29.0","v0.29.1","v0.29.2","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.30.0","v0.30.1","v0.30.2","v0.30.3","v0.30.4","v0.30.5","v0.31.0","v0.31.1","v0.31.2","v0.32.0","v0.32.1","v0.32.2","v0.32.3","v0.33.0","v0.33.1","v0.33.2","v0.33.3","v0.33.4","v0.33.5","v0.33.6","v0.33.7","v0.33.8","v0.33.9","v0.34.0","v0.34.1","v0.34.2","v0.34.3","v0.35.0","v0.35.1","v0.35.2","v0.35.3","v0.35.4","v0.36.0","v0.36.1","v0.36.10","v0.36.11","v0.36.2","v0.36.3","v0.36.4","v0.36.5","v0.36.6","v0.36.7","v0.36.8","v0.36.9","v0.37.0","v0.37.1","v0.37.2","v0.37.3","v0.37.4","v0.37.5","v0.37.6","v0.37.7","v0.37.8","v0.4.0","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.4.8","v0.4.9","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.10","v0.6.11","v0.6.12","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v0.6.6","v0.6.7","v0.6.8","v0.6.9","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.5","v0.7.6","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.8.5","v0.8.6","v0.8.7","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.10","v1.4.11","v1.4.12","v1.4.13","v1.4.14","v1.4.15","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.4.7","v1.4.8","v1.4.9","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.6.9","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.7.5","v1.7.6","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2-beta.1","v1.8.2-beta.2","v1.8.2-beta.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-1000118.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["328839760708942789335568701943684382601","27844210034093496813267200179202386281","234101312140772088624871659387187070490","172497929593298278628759597721012553475"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2018-1000118-077a3794","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/electron/electron/commit/ce361a12e355f9e1e99c989f1ea056c9e502dbe7","target":{"file":"atom/app/command_line_args.cc"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"141241556246165599305210746198188142918","length":681},"id":"CVE-2018-1000118-26cf1075","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/electron/electron/commit/ce361a12e355f9e1e99c989f1ea056c9e502dbe7","target":{"file":"atom/app/command_line_args.cc","function":"IsBlacklistedArg"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://electronjs.org/releases#1.8.2-beta.5"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/electron/electron/commit/ce361a12e355f9e1e99c989f1ea056c9e502dbe7"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
