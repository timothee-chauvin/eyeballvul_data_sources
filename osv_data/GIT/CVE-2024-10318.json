  "details": "A session fixation issue was discovered in the NGINX OpenID Connect reference implementation, where a nonce was not checked at login time. This flaw allows an attacker to fix a victim's session to an attacker-controlled account. As a result, although the attacker cannot log in as the victim, they can force the session to associate it with the attacker-controlled account, leading to potential misuse of the victim's session.",
