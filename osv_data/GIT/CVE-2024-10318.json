This flaw allows an attacker to fix a victim's session to an attacker-controlled account. As a result, although the attacker cannot log in as the victim, they can force the session to associate it with the attacker-controlled account, leading to potential misuse of the victim's session.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress","events":[{"introduced":"868bb7771adf2bfebcc1d42b96a26e13123cdca7"},{"fixed":"cc54bee9b88db2d8c3c8f75f662c8af3b7f549ae"}]}],"versions":["v3.0.0","v3.1.0","v3.2.0","v3.3.0","v3.7.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-10318.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000148232"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
