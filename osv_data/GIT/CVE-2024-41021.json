{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-41021","published":"2024-07-29T13:34:22.636Z","modified":"2025-12-05T05:48:15.820123Z","summary":"s390/mm: Fix VM_FAULT_HWPOISON handling in do_exception()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/mm: Fix VM_FAULT_HWPOISON handling in do_exception()\n\nThere is no support for HWPOISON, MEMORY_FAILURE, or ARCH_HAS_COPY_MC on\ns390. Therefore we do not expect to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in\ndo_exception().\n\nHowever, since commit af19487f00f3 (\"mm: make PTE_MARKER_SWAPIN_ERROR more\ngeneral\"), it is possible to see VM_FAULT_HWPOISON in combination with\nPTE_MARKER_POISONED, even on architectures that do not support HWPOISON\notherwise. In this case, we will end up on the BUG() in do_exception().\n\nFix this by treating VM_FAULT_HWPOISON the same as VM_FAULT_SIGBUS, similar\nto x86 when MEMORY_FAILURE is not configured. Also print unexpected fault\nflags, for easier debugging.\n\nNote that VM_FAULT_HWPOISON_LARGE is not expected, because s390 cannot\nsupport swap entries on other levels than PTE level.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"af19487f00f34ff8643921d7909dbb3fedc7e329"},{"fixed":"73a9260b7366d2906ec011e100319359fe2277d0"},{"fixed":"9e13767ccefdc4f8aa92514b592b60f6b54882ff"},{"fixed":"a3aefb871222a9880602d1a44a558177b4143e3b"},{"fixed":"df39038cd89525d465c2c8827eb64116873f141a"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.10.1","v6.5","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.5","v6.6.6","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7","v6.9.1","v6.9.10","v6.9.11","v6.9.2","v6.9.3","v6.9.4","v6.9.5","v6.9.6","v6.9.7","v6.9.8","v6.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-41021.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.6.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.44"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.9.12"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.10.0"},{"fixed":"6.10.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-41021.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/73a9260b7366d2906ec011e100319359fe2277d0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9e13767ccefdc4f8aa92514b592b60f6b54882ff"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a3aefb871222a9880602d1a44a558177b4143e3b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/df39038cd89525d465c2c8827eb64116873f141a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/41xxx/CVE-2024-41021.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41021"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/41xxx/CVE-2024-41021.json"}}
