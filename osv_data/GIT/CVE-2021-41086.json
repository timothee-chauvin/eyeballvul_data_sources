In affected versions users are subject to cross site scripting (XSS) attacks via clipboard content. jsuites is vulnerable to DOM based XSS if the user can be tricked into copying _anything_ from a malicious and pasting it into the html editor. This is because a part of the clipboard content is directly written to `innerHTML` allowing for javascript injection and thus XSS. Users are advised to update to version 4.9.11 to resolve.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jsuites/jsuites","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d47a6f4e143188dde2742f4cffd313e1068ad3b3"},{"fixed":"fe1d3cc5e339f2f4da8ed1f9f42271fdf9cbd8d2"}]}],"versions":["v3.1.0","v3.5.0","v3.7.0","v3.9.9","v4.4.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-41086.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jsuites/jsuites/commit/d47a6f4e143188dde2742f4cffd313e1068ad3b3"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jsuites/jsuites/commit/fe1d3cc5e339f2f4da8ed1f9f42271fdf9cbd8d2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/jsuites/jsuites/security/advisories/GHSA-qh7x-j4v8-qw5w"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
