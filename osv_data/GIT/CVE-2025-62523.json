{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62523","published":"2025-10-27T20:10:51.351Z","modified":"2025-12-05T10:21:19.995502Z","aliases":["GHSA-pgfw-f4mp-5445"],"summary":"PILOS Misconfigured the Access-Control-Allow-Origin Header","details":"PILOS (Platform for Interactive Live-Online Seminars) is a frontend for BigBlueButton. PILOS before 4.8.0 includes a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration in its middleware: it reflects the Origin request header back in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header without proper validation or a whitelist, while Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is set to true. This behavior could allow a malicious website on a different origin to send requests (including credentials) to the PILOS API. This may enable exfiltration or actions using the victim’s credentials if the server accepts those cross-origin requests as authenticated. Laravel’s session handling applies additional origin checks such that cross-origin requests are not authenticated by default. Because of these session-origin protections, and in the absence of any other unknown vulnerabilities that would bypass Laravel’s origin/session checks, this reflected-Origin CORS misconfiguration is not believed to be exploitable in typical PILOS deployments. This vulnerability has been patched in PILOS in v4.8.0","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/thm-health/pilos","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"abc974d1ed81995ff6cadf7184d5d5c11e57e215"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4","v1.9.5","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-RC.1","v2.0.0-RC.2","v2.0.0-RC.3","v2.0.0-RC.4","v2.0.0-alpha.1","v2.0.0-alpha.2","v2.0.0-alpha.3","v2.0.0-alpha.4","v2.0.0-alpha.5","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-RC.1","v4.0.0-RC.2","v4.0.0-RC.3","v4.0.0-RC.4","v4.0.0-beta.1","v4.0.0-beta.2","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.2","v4.2.0","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.4.0","v4.5.0","v4.6.0","v4.6.1","v4.7.0","v4.7.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62523.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/62xxx/CVE-2025-62523.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/THM-Health/PILOS/commit/14655bc4f8128ffd2b3c25004b01d9a802808da8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/THM-Health/PILOS/security/advisories/GHSA-pgfw-f4mp-5445"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62523"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-942"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/62xxx/CVE-2025-62523.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
