An attacker within radio range can silently trigger the assertion (which disables the target's BLE stack) by sending a crafted sequence of BLE packets.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"ee899cb2aac50349bb83524910f4f34920579386"}]}],"versions":["v0.9","v1.0","v2.0-rc1","v2.1-rc1","v3.0-dev","v3.1-beta1","v3.1-dev","v3.2-beta1","v3.2-dev","v3.3-beta1","v3.3-beta2","v3.3-dev","v4.0-dev","v4.1-dev","v4.2-dev"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-13595.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://asset-group.github.io/cves.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://asset-group.github.io/disclosures/sweyntooth/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/espressif/esp32-bt-lib"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
