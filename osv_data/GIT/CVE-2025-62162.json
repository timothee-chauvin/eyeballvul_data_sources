Starting in version 0.10.0 and prior to version 0.11.4, parsing certain malformed CEL expressions can cause the parser to panic, terminating the process. When the crate is used to evaluate untrusted expressions (e.g., user-supplied input over an API), an attacker can send crafted input to trigger a denial of service (DoS). Version 0.11.4 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cel-rust/cel-rust","events":[{"introduced":"1551bd799d7379f0c8795d9e13e0d14a92a17002"},{"fixed":"4e4d40d33529add8a4e3dd70ddacc7c7b5a91663"}]}],"versions":["cel-v0.10.0","cel-v0.11.0","cel-v0.11.1","cel-v0.11.2","cel-v0.11.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62162.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/cel-rust/cel-rust/security/advisories/GHSA-wxwx-9fh7-5mrw"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cel-rust/cel-rust/releases/tag/cel-v0.11.4"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
