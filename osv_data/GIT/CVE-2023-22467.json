{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-22467","published":"2023-01-04T21:52:14Z","modified":"2025-11-04T20:09:53.067599Z","aliases":["GHSA-3xq5-wjfh-ppjc"],"related":["GHSA-3xq5-wjfh-ppjc","GHSA-wc69-rhjr-hc9g"],"summary":"luxon.js inefficient regular expression complexity vulnerability","details":"Luxon is a library for working with dates and times in JavaScript. On the 1.x branch prior to 1.38.1, the 2.x branch prior to 2.5.2, and the 3.x branch on 3.2.1, Luxon's `DateTime.fromRFC2822() has quadratic (N^2) complexity on some specific inputs. This causes a noticeable slowdown for inputs with lengths above 10k characters. Users providing untrusted data to this method are therefore vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. This issue also appears in Moment as CVE-2022-31129. Versions 1.38.1, 2.5.2, and 3.2.1 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, limit the length of the input.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/moment/luxon","events":[{"introduced":"0cbffd9c87eca6ac9a75dce124ce890dd945bc78"},{"fixed":"204cdfe65e4a3f0e3a9d0d7489278152d2c51234"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.5.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/moment/luxon","events":[{"introduced":"857812f9ccb1351b4f7cd7f90f3f9e5e17d7fe94"},{"fixed":"b1fee58b8719176ff55eb9709084102f6baeb77a"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.0.0"},{"fixed":"3.2.1"}]}}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.0.1","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.4.0","2.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-22467.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/moment/luxon/commit/5ab3bf64a10da929a437629cdb2f059bb83212bf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/moment/luxon/security/advisories/GHSA-3xq5-wjfh-ppjc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/6015#issuecomment-1152961973"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-wc69-rhjr-hc9g"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/44I3WAJKYXDLOVYRGMHAUXMIV4SPFXDZ/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4LIVOASKBQH7FEUI5RWM3SOHR6VK7ZZR/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1333"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
