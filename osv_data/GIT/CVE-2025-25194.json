This vulnerability, which is present in versions 0.6.2 and prior of activitypub_federation and versions 0.19.8 and prior of Lemmy, allows a user to bypass any predefined hardcoded URL path or security anti-Localhost mechanism and perform an arbitrary GET request to any Host, Port and URL using a Webfinger Request.
