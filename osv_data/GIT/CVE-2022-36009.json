{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-36009","published":"2022-08-19T20:35:09Z","modified":"2025-11-05T10:35:40Z","aliases":["GHSA-grvv-h2f9-7v9c","GO-2022-0952"],"summary":"Incorrect parsing of access level in gomatrixserverlib and dendrite","details":"gomatrixserverlib is a Go library for matrix protocol federation. Dendrite is a Matrix homeserver written in Go, an alternative to Synapse. The power level parsing within gomatrixserverlib was failing to parse the `\"events_default\"` key of the `m.room.power_levels` event, defaulting the event default power level to zero in all cases. Power levels are the matrix terminology for user access level. In rooms where the `\"events_default\"` power level had been changed, this could result in events either being incorrectly authorised or rejected by Dendrite servers. gomatrixserverlib contains a fix as of commit `723fd49` and Dendrite 0.9.3 has been updated accordingly. Matrix rooms where the `\"events_default\"` power level has not been changed from the default of zero are not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-36009.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"723fd495dde835d078b9f2074b6b62c06dea4575"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-36009.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib/commit/723fd495dde835d078b9f2074b6b62c06dea4575"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib/security/advisories/GHSA-grvv-h2f9-7v9c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation/#power-levels"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-863"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
