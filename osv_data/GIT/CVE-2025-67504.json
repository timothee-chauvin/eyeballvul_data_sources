Versions 1.6.4 and below use function GenerateRandomPassword() to create passwords using PHP's rand(). rand() is not cryptographically secure, which allows password sequences to be predicted or brute-forced. This can lead to user account compromise or privilege escalation if these passwords are used for new accounts or password resets. The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.6.5.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wbce/wbce_cms","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"458d4385482770a7f6e77361e64265c1413b0c99"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.0-beta.1","1.0.0-beta.2","1.0.0-beta.3","1.0.0-rc.1","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.10","1.1.11","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.1.6","1.1.8","1.1.9","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.4","1.6.0","1.6.0-beta.1","1.6.0-beta.2","1.6.0-beta.4","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.6.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-67504.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67504.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/WBCE/WBCE_CMS/commit/5d59fe021a5c6e469b1bf192b72ca652e54278f6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/WBCE/WBCE_CMS/releases/tag/1.6.5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/WBCE/WBCE_CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-76gj-pmvx-jcc6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67504"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-331","CWE-338"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/67xxx/CVE-2025-67504.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
