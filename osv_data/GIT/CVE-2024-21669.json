{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-21669","published":"2024-01-11T05:40:30.458Z","modified":"2025-11-20T02:03:28.360426Z","aliases":["GHSA-97x9-59rv-q5pm"],"summary":"Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python result of presentation verification not checked for LDP-VC","details":"Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) is a foundation for building decentralized identity applications and services running in non-mobile environments. When verifying W3C Format Verifiable Credentials using JSON-LD with Linked Data Proofs (LDP-VCs), the result of verifying the presentation `document.proof` was not factored into the final `verified` value (`true`/`false`) on the presentation record. The flaw enables holders of W3C Format Verifiable Credentials using JSON-LD with Linked Data Proofs (LDPs) to present incorrectly constructed proofs, and allows malicious verifiers to save and replay a presentation from such holders as their own. This vulnerability has been present since version 0.7.0 and fixed in version 0.10.5.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python","events":[{"introduced":"89324e24dfbc46d22e4bca5895089c08558e6943"},{"fixed":"66c9c0210d7c8792330d58c38143323d3e2ab86d"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-21669.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0b01ffffc0789205ac990292f97238614c9fd293"},{"fixed":"4c45244e2085aeff2f038dd771710e92d7682ff2"},{"fixed":"66c9c0210d7c8792330d58c38143323d3e2ab86d"},{"fixed":"8d04f0e280ba08bae1a9cb99d80c8e4c2a0def64"}]}],"versions":["0.10.0","0.10.0-rc0","0.10.0-rc1","0.10.0-rc2","0.10.1","0.11.0-rc1","0.11.0rc2","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.3.3","0.3.4","0.3.5","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.4.3","0.4.4","0.4.5","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.5.2","0.5.3","0.5.4","0.5.5","0.5.6","0.6.0","0.6.0-rc0","0.6.0-rc1","0.7.0","0.7.0-rc0","0.7.0-rc1","0.7.1","0.7.1-rc0","0.7.2","0.7.2-rc0","0.7.3","0.7.3-rc0","0.7.4","0.7.4-rc0","0.7.4-rc1","0.7.4-rc2","0.7.4-rc3","0.7.4-rc4","0.7.4-rc5","0.8.0","0.8.0-rc0","0.8.1","0.8.1-rc0","0.8.1-rc1","0.8.1-rc2","0.8.2","0.8.2-rc0","0.8.2-rc1","0.8.2-rc2","0.9.0","0.9.0-rc0","1.0.0-rc0","1.0.0-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-21669.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/commit/0b01ffffc0789205ac990292f97238614c9fd293"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/commit/4c45244e2085aeff2f038dd771710e92d7682ff2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases/tag/0.10.5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases/tag/0.11.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/security/advisories/GHSA-97x9-59rv-q5pm"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-347"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
