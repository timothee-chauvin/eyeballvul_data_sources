In versions prior to 4.2.10 and 4.4.5, the search end-point response headers contain information about Elasticsearch software in use. This information is valuable from a security point of view because it allows software used by the server to be easily identified. GeoNetwork 4.4.5 and 4.2.10 fix this issue. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"680b48cd156778c1beaf78917153e470f9d80736"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.2.10"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork","events":[{"introduced":"19b9edba4f9a5718047d3b17eb874c3ca769c26e"},{"fixed":"d9f211c94a08cd2829ba54be9c9a8d9f19411de3"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"4.4.0"},{"fixed":"4.4.5"}]}}],"versions":["2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.3","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.3","2.6.4","3.0.0","3.0.0RC0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.4.0","3.4.1","3.4.2","4.0.0","4.0.0-alpha.1","4.0.0-alpha.2","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.0.4","4.0.5","4.0.6","4.2.0","4.2.1","4.2.2","4.2.3","4.2.4","4.2.5","4.2.6","4.2.7","4.2.8","4.2.9","4.4.0","4.4.1","4.4.2","4.4.3","4.4.4","start-migration"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-32037.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.geonetwork-opensource.org/4.4/api/search"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/releases/tag/4.2.10"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/releases/tag/4.4.5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/security/advisories/GHSA-52rf-25hq-5m33"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N"}]}
