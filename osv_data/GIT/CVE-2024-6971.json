{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-6971","published":"2024-10-11T13:15:16Z","modified":"2025-10-22T07:41:50.313170Z","aliases":["GHSA-7pgr-32fx-c6x9"],"details":"A path traversal vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui repository, specifically in the `lollms_file_system.py` file. The functions `add_rag_database`, `toggle_mount_rag_database`, and `vectorize_folder` do not implement security measures such as `sanitize_path_from_endpoint` or `sanitize_path`. This allows an attacker to perform vectorize operations on `.sqlite` files in any directory on the victim's computer, potentially installing multiple packages and causing a crash.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"8a8e3a1c386321f641a014bf8f7029512ccad411"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9","v3.0","v3.5","v4.0","v5.0","v6.0","v6.5","v6.5.0","v6.5rc2","v6.7","v7.0","v8.0","v8.5","v9.0","v9.1","v9.2","v9.3","v9.4","v9.5","v9.6","v9.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-6971.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/fbfe7cd0-99fb-4305-bd07-8b573364109e"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
