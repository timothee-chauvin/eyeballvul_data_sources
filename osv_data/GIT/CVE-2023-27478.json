This issue has been addressed in version 1.1.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are several ways to workaround or lower the probability of this bug affecting a given deployment. 1: use a reasonably high `POLL_TIMEOUT` setting, like the default. 2: use separate libmemcached connections for unrelated data. 3: do not re-use libmemcached connections in an unknown state.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"48dcc61a"},{"fixed":"92d18858b417309f6bdee6bce464a4f3d6a375fd"}]}],"versions":["0.10","0.11","0.13","0.14","0.15","0.2","0.20","0.21","0.22","0.23","0.25","0.26","0.27","0.28","0.29","0.29-2","0.3","0.30","0.31","0.32","0.34","0.35","0.37","0.4","0.40","0.41","0.44","0.5","0.51","0.52","0.53","0.7","0.8","0_7","1.0.10","1.0.11","1.0.12","1.0.13","1.0.14","1.0.15","1.0.16","1.0.17","1.0.18","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","1.0.9","1.1.0","1.1.0-beta1","1.1.0-beta2","1.1.0-beta3","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","_11","_20","_23","post_cmake","pre_cmake"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-27478.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/commit/48dcc61a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/releases/tag/1.1.4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/security/advisories/GHSA-wwmh-39wj-fx59"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/php-memcached-dev/php-memcached/issues/531"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
