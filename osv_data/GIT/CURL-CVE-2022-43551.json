Like using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (`IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP`)\ninstead of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E). Then in a subsequent request,\nit does not detect the HSTS state and makes a clear text transfer. Because it\nwould store the info IDN encoded but look for it IDN decoded.\n\nReproducible like this:\n\n    curl --hsts hsts.txt https://curl%E3%80%82se\n    curl --hsts hsts.txt http://curl%E3%80%82se","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"7.77.0"},{"fixed":"7.87.0"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git","events":[{"introduced":"7385610d0c74c6a254fea5e4cd6e1d559d848c8c"},{"fixed":"9e71901634e276dd050481c4320f046bebb1bc28"}]}],"versions":["7.86.0","7.85.0","7.84.0","7.83.1","7.83.0","7.82.0","7.81.0","7.80.0","7.79.1","7.79.0","7.78.0","7.77.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://curl.se/docs/CURL-CVE-2022-43551.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["115593449884153395574841568102105793623","66141309811636582684301952524013472896","201897456876434882336981827853021814011","273071773399813072544352658708868299669"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CURL-CVE-2022-43551-6785e029","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git/commit/9e71901634e276dd050481c4320f046bebb1bc28","target":{"file":"lib/http.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"244903423420342332646590161289106789453","length":6879},"id":"CURL-CVE-2022-43551-7a7ea481","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git/commit/9e71901634e276dd050481c4320f046bebb1bc28","target":{"file":"lib/http.c","function":"Curl_http_header"}}]}}],"database_specific":{"CWE":{"desc":"Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information","id":"CWE-319"},"URL":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-43551.json","affects":"both","award":{"amount":"2400","currency":"USD"},"issue":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1755083","last_affected":"7.86.0","package":"curl","severity":"Medium","www":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-43551.html"},"credits":[{"name":"Hiroki Kurosawa","type":"FINDER"},{"name":"Daniel Stenberg","type":"REMEDIATION_DEVELOPER"}]}
