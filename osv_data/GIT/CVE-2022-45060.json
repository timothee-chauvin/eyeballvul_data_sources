An attacker may introduce characters through HTTP/2 pseudo-headers that are invalid in the context of an HTTP/1 request line, causing the Varnish server to produce invalid HTTP/1 requests to the backend. This could, in turn, be used to exploit vulnerabilities in a server behind the Varnish server. Note: the 6.0.x LTS series (before 6.0.11) is affected.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache","events":[{"introduced":"a068361dff0d25a0d85cf82a6e5fdaf315e06a7d"},{"fixed":"a3bc025c2df28e4a76e10c2c41217c9864e9963b"}]}],"versions":["varnish-6.0.0","varnish-6.0.1","varnish-6.0.10","varnish-6.0.2","varnish-6.0.3","varnish-6.0.4","varnish-6.0.5","varnish-6.0.6","varnish-6.0.7","varnish-6.0.8","varnish-6.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-45060.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["105553821208315179366129639845453211870","127635665085636467239850132907701811888"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2022-45060-04ec6fd0","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/commit/a3bc025c2df28e4a76e10c2c41217c9864e9963b","target":{"file":"lib/libvarnish/version.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"270466461008454793612066310759590844104","length":232},"id":"CVE-2022-45060-4fbc69af","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/commit/a3bc025c2df28e4a76e10c2c41217c9864e9963b","target":{"file":"lib/libvarnish/version.c","function":"VCS_Message"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.varnish-software.com/security/VSV00011"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00036.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00011.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5334"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/G6ZMOZVBLZXHEV5VRW4I4SOWLQEK5OF5/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M4KVVCIQVINQQ2D7ORNARSYALMJUMP3I/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XGF6LFTHXCSYMYUX5HLMVXQH3WHCSFLU/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
