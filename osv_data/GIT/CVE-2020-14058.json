Due to use of a potentially dangerous function, Squid and the default certificate validation helper are vulnerable to a Denial of Service when opening a TLS connection to an attacker-controlled server for HTTPS. This occurs because unrecognized error values are mapped to NULL, but later code expects that each error value is mapped to a valid error string.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/squid-cache/squid","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5ba5ba8c40cb11d62886ee60fe6c3646f815fdea"}]}],"versions":["BASIC_TPROXY4","BumpSslServerFirst.take01","BumpSslServerFirst.take02","BumpSslServerFirst.take03","BumpSslServerFirst.take04","BumpSslServerFirst.take05","BumpSslServerFirst.take06","BumpSslServerFirst.take07","BumpSslServerFirst.take08","BumpSslServerFirst.take09","BumpSslServerFirst.take10","HISTORIC_RELEASES","SQUID_3_0_PRE1","SQUID_3_0_PRE2","SQUID_3_0_PRE3","SQUID_3_0_PRE4","SQUID_3_0_PRE5","SQUID_3_0_PRE6","SQUID_3_0_PRE7","SQUID_3_0_RC1","SQUID_4_0_1","SQUID_4_0_10","SQUID_4_0_11","SQUID_4_0_12","SQUID_4_0_13","SQUID_4_0_14","SQUID_4_0_15","SQUID_4_0_16","SQUID_4_0_17","SQUID_4_0_18","SQUID_4_0_19","SQUID_4_0_2","SQUID_4_0_20","SQUID_4_0_21","SQUID_4_0_22","SQUID_4_0_23","SQUID_4_0_24","SQUID_4_0_25","SQUID_4_0_3","SQUID_4_0_4","SQUID_4_0_5","SQUID_4_0_6","SQUID_4_0_7","SQUID_4_0_8","SQUID_4_0_9","SQUID_4_1","SQUID_4_10","SQUID_4_11","SQUID_4_2","SQUID_4_3","SQUID_4_4","SQUID_4_5","SQUID_4_6","SQUID_4_7","SQUID_4_8","SQUID_4_9","for-libecap-v0p1","merge-candidate-3-v1","merge-candidate-3-v2","sourceformat-review-1","take00","take01","take02","take03","take04","take06","take07","take08","take09","take1","take2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-14058.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2020_6.txt"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/squid-4-93f5fda134a2a010b84ffedbe833d670e63ba4be.patch"},{"type":"FIX","url":"http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/changesets/squid-5-c6d1a4f6a2cbebceebc8a3fcd8f539ceb7b7f723.patch"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210312-0001/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3RG5FGSTCAYVIJPJHIY3MRZ7NFT6HDO7/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
