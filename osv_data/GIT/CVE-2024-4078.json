The issue arises from the lack of path sanitization when handling the `name` parameter in the `unInstall_binding` function, allowing an attacker to traverse directories and execute arbitrary code by loading a malicious `__init__.py` file. This vulnerability affects the latest version of the software. The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution on the system where parisneo/lollms is deployed.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/parisneo/lollms","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7ebe08da7e0026b155af4f7be1d6417bc64cf02f"}]}],"versions":["v5.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-4078.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/parisneo/lollms/commit/7ebe08da7e0026b155af4f7be1d6417bc64cf02f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/a55a8c04-df44-49b2-bcfa-2a2b728a299d"}]}
