Prior to version 1.1.7, a private key can be extracted on signing a malicious JSON-stringifiable object, when global Buffer is the buffer package. This affects only environments where require('buffer') is the NPM buffer package. The Buffer.isBuffer check can be bypassed, resulting in k reuse for different messages, leading to private key extraction over a single invalid message (and a second one for which any message/signature could be taken, e.g. previously known valid one). This issue has been patched in version 1.1.7.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bitcoinjs/tiny-secp256k1","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"fc53db79af6e2738661ea3dcaf3c4ecb8541a149"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.1.0","v0.2.2","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-49364.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bitcoinjs/tiny-secp256k1/security/advisories/GHSA-7mc2-6phr-23xc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/bitcoinjs/tiny-secp256k1/pull/140"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-522"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
