fix invalid wait context of page_pool_destroy()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxdp: fix invalid wait context of page_pool_destroy()\n\nIf the driver uses a page pool, it creates a page pool with\npage_pool_create().\nThe reference count of page pool is 1 as default.\nA page pool will be destroyed only when a reference count reaches 0.\npage_pool_destroy() is used to destroy page pool, it decreases a\nreference count.\nWhen a page pool is destroyed, ->disconnect() is called, which is\nmem_allocator_disconnect().\nThis function internally acquires mutex_lock().\n\nIf the driver uses XDP, it registers a memory model with\nxdp_rxq_info_reg_mem_model().\nThe xdp_rxq_info_reg_mem_model() internally increases a page pool\nreference count if a memory model is a page pool.\nNow the reference count is 2.\n\nTo destroy a page pool, the driver should call both page_pool_destroy()\nand xdp_unreg_mem_model().\nThe xdp_unreg_mem_model() internally calls page_pool_destroy().\nOnly page_pool_destroy() decreases a reference count.\n\nIf a driver calls page_pool_destroy() then xdp_unreg_mem_model(), we\nwill face an invalid wait context warning.\nBecause xdp_unreg_mem_model() calls page_pool_destroy() with\nrcu_read_lock().\nThe page_pool_destroy() internally acquires mutex_lock().\n\nSplat looks

rcu_read_lock() here is safe.\nxa is freed by __xdp_mem_allocator_rcu_free() and this is called by\ncall_rcu() of mem_xa_remove().\nThe mem_xa_remove() is called by page_pool_destroy() if a reference\ncount reaches 0.\nThe xa is already protected by the reference count mechanism well in the\ncontrol plane.\nSo removing rcu_read_lock() for page_pool_destroy() is
