A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.23.4 and 2.24.1 that enables an authenticated administrator with workspace-level privileges to store a JavaScript payload in the GeoServer catalog that will execute in the context of another user's browser when viewed in the GWC Demos Page.  Access to the GWC Demos Page is available to all users although data security may limit users' ability to trigger the XSS. Versions 2.23.4 and 2.24.1 contain a patch for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"31f4807730bc3c65ebd6cf2cbda994e178cd3e86"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-23821.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/23xxx/CVE-2024-23821.json"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/GeoWebCache/geowebcache/issues/1171"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/GeoWebCache/geowebcache/pull/1173"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-88wc-fcj9-q3r9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23821"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/23xxx/CVE-2024-23821.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
