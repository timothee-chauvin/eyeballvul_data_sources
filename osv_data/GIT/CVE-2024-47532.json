A user can gain access to protected (and potentially sensible) information indirectly via AttributeError.obj and the string module. The problem will be fixed in version 7.3. As a workaround, If the application does not require access to the module string, it can remove it from RestrictedPython.Utilities.utility_builtins or otherwise do not make it available in the restricted execution environment.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zopefoundation/restrictedpython","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"dc6c38f4da03c25683d90ab239a16dbae9d47b70"}]}],"versions":["4.0","4.0a1","4.0a2","4.0a3","4.0b1","4.0b2","4.0b3","4.0b4","4.0b5","4.0b6","4.0b7","4.0b8","5.0","5.1","5.2","5.2a1.dev0","5.3a1.dev0","6.0","6.0a1.dev0","7.0","7.0a1.dev0","7.0a1.dev1","7.0a2.dev0","7.1","7.2","7.2a1.dev0","backups/davisagli-python27@114380","backups/zope2@76328"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47532.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython/commit/d701cc36cccac36b21fa200f1f2d1945a9a215e6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython/security/advisories/GHSA-5rfv-66g4-jr8h"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
