{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-25285","published":"2025-02-14T19:31:44.827Z","modified":"2025-12-05T08:53:20.822995Z","aliases":["GHSA-x4c5-c7rf-jjgv"],"related":["CGA-7cr5-25mq-fvpc"],"summary":"@octokit/endpoint has a Regular Expression in parse that Leads to ReDoS Vulnerability Due to Catastrophic Backtracking","details":"@octokit/endpoint turns REST API endpoints into generic request options. Starting in version 4.1.0 and prior to version 10.1.3, by crafting specific `options` parameters, the `endpoint.parse(options)` call can be triggered, leading to a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attack. This causes the program to hang and results in high CPU utilization. The issue occurs in the `parse` function within the `parse.ts` file of the npm package `@octokit/endpoint`. Version 10.1.3 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/octokit/endpoint.js","events":[{"introduced":"a87ff65e2f45684115fa32da4d4f688a5e28668c"},{"fixed":"d6cf1ad777b22f80b6f6ae88c03b4ed4139dd2d2"}]}],"versions":["v10.0.0","v10.0.1","v10.1.0","v10.1.1","v10.1.2","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v5.0.0","v5.0.1","v5.1.0","v5.1.1","v5.1.2","v5.1.3","v5.1.4","v5.1.5","v5.1.6","v5.1.7","v5.1.8","v5.2.0","v5.2.1","v5.2.2","v5.3.0","v5.3.1","v5.3.2","v5.3.3","v5.3.4","v5.3.5","v5.3.6","v5.4.0","v5.4.1","v5.5.0","v5.5.1","v5.5.2","v5.5.3","v6.0.0","v6.0.1","v6.0.10","v6.0.11","v6.0.12","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.0.6","v6.0.7","v6.0.8","v6.0.9","v7.0.0","v7.0.1","v7.0.2","v7.0.3","v7.0.4","v7.0.5","v7.0.6","v8.0.0","v8.0.1","v9.0.0","v9.0.1","v9.0.2","v9.0.3","v9.0.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-25285.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/25xxx/CVE-2025-25285.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/octokit/endpoint.js/blob/main/src/parse.ts"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/octokit/endpoint.js/commit/6c9c5be033c450d436efb37de41b6470c22f7db8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/octokit/endpoint.js/security/advisories/GHSA-x4c5-c7rf-jjgv"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25285"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-1333"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/25xxx/CVE-2025-25285.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
