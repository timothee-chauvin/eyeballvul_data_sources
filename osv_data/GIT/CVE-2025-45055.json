An authenticated user can upload a malicious SVG file as an event attachment, which, when viewed by an administrator, executes embedded JavaScript in the admin's session. This allows attackers to escalate privileges by creating a new administrator account. The vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization of SVG files and weak CSRF protections.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/silverpeas/silverpeas-core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"a4af07530d880b59a73e393a22c9d572afd09f09"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-45055.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://medium.com/@mingihongkim/privilege-escalation-via-svg-injection-in-silverpeas-6-4-2-b5ab1d5b6955"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Silverpeas/Silverpeas-Core/pull/1394"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
