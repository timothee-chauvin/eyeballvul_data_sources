Since version 4.12.0, Dependency-Track users with the SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION permission can configure a \"welcome message\", which is HTML that is to be rendered on the login page for branding purposes. When rendering the welcome message, Dependency-Track versions before 4.13.6 did not properly sanitize the HTML, allowing arbitrary JavaScript to be executed. Users with the SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION permission (i.e., administrators), can exploit this weakness to execute arbitrary JavaScript for users browsing to the login page. The issue has been fixed in version 4.13.6.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dependencytrack/frontend","events":[{"introduced":"33c050b6c099bacb64701b1863df10699afa351b"},{"fixed":"74eee4a5153fd597c077f92ebdac03b8d195fd22"}]}],"versions":["4.12.0","4.13.0","4.13.1","4.13.2","4.13.3","4.13.4","4.13.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64758.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend/commit/8fd757be612eaf4f35eadbe4c334204d7bd711be"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend/pull/1378"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend/pull/986"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend/security/advisories/GHSA-7xvh-c266-cfr5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
