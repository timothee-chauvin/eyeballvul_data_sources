In AD this is implemented by a user attribute delegation_not_allowed (aka not-delegated), which translates to disallow-forwardable. However the Samba AD DC does not do that for S4U2Self and does set the forwardable flag even if the impersonated client has the not-delegated flag set.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/samba-team/samba","events":[{"introduced":"df33344d8eb40221d60c99931690703a11d91bc2"},{"fixed":"631a49647b76cc203917fa8d32e11ab3935106b3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-14870.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-12/msg00038.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-14870"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/05/msg00023.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00034.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-52"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-06"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191210-0002/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230216-0008/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4217-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4217-2/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2019-14870.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.synology.com/security/advisory/Synology_SA_19_40"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PJH3ROOFYMOATD2UEPC47P5RPBDTY77E/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WNKA4YIPV7AZR7KK3GW6L3HKGHSGJZFE/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
