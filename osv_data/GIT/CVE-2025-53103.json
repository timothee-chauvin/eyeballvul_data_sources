From version 5.12.0 to 5.13.1, JUnit's support for writing Open Test Reporting XML files can leak Git credentials. The impact depends on the level of the access token exposed through the OpenTestReportGeneratingListener. If these test reports are published or stored anywhere public, then there is the possibility that a rouge attacker can steal the token and perform elevated actions by impersonating the user or app. This issue as been patched in version 5.13.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework","events":[{"introduced":"2750b0402e38fbed2c15ec47e8b422aa812a9e1e"},{"fixed":"e51deb24d2f45113952cec351ae207f9477d7792"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53103.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/security/advisories/GHSA-m43g-m425-p68x"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/commit/d4fc834c8c1c0b3168cd030c13551d1d041f51bc"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-312"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
