{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62504","published":"2025-10-16T21:23:41.883Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:40:50.487129Z","aliases":["BIT-envoy-2025-62504","GHSA-gcxr-6vrp-wff3"],"summary":"Envoy Lua filter use-after-free when oversized rewritten response body causes crash","details":"Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy. Envoy versions earlier than 1.36.2, 1.35.6, 1.34.10, and 1.33.12 contain a use-after-free vulnerability in the Lua filter. When a Lua script executing in the response phase rewrites a response body so that its size exceeds the configured per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes (default 1MB), Envoy generates a local reply whose headers override the original response headers, leaving dangling references and causing a crash. This results in denial of service. Updating to versions 1.36.2, 1.35.6, 1.34.10, or 1.33.12 fixes the issue. Increasing per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes (and for HTTP/2 the initial_stream_window_size) or increasing per_request_buffer_limit_bytes / request_body_buffer_limit can reduce the likelihood of triggering the condition but does not correct the underlying memory safety flaw.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"63ee0dc79dce88117c6bd2df5a742f8eb67ea980"},{"last_affected":"1dbcf4d36b57c50b3887fda69e991b88eec80dd5"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.36.0"},{"last_affected":"1.36.1"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"d7809ba2b07fd869d49bfb122b27f6a7977b4d94"},{"last_affected":"bae9f08572b88c27ae450e82a258621ef48936c1"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.34.0"},{"last_affected":"1.34.9"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"efeb4433e6d181214c732c67418c7ba0f933d017"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.33.11"}]}}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.17.0","v1.18.0","v1.18.1","v1.18.2","v1.19.0","v1.2.0","v1.20.0","v1.21.0","v1.22.0","v1.23.0","v1.24.0","v1.25.0","v1.26.0","v1.27.0","v1.28.0","v1.29.0","v1.3.0","v1.30.0","v1.31.0","v1.32.0","v1.33.0","v1.33.1","v1.33.10","v1.33.11","v1.33.2","v1.33.3","v1.33.4","v1.33.5","v1.33.6","v1.33.7","v1.33.8","v1.33.9","v1.34.0","v1.34.1","v1.34.2","v1.34.3","v1.34.4","v1.34.5","v1.34.6","v1.34.7","v1.34.8","v1.34.9","v1.36.0","v1.36.1","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62504.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-gcxr-6vrp-wff3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-416"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
