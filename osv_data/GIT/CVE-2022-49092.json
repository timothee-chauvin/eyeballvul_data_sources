That is, a route is found\nbut we hit a warning while matching it. The warning is from\nfib_info_nh() in include/net/nexthop.h because we run it on a fib_info\nwith nexthop object. The call chain is:\n inet_rtm_delroute -> fib_table_delete -> fib_nh_match (called with a\nnexthop fib_info and also with fc_oif set thus calling fib_info_nh on\nthe fib_info and triggering the warning). The fix is to not do any\nmatching in that branch if the fi has a nexthop object because those are\nmanaged separately. I.e. we should match when deleting without nh spec and\nshould fail when deleting a nexthop route with old-style nh spec because\nnexthop objects are managed separately, e.g.:\n $ ip r show 1.2.3.4/32\n 1.2.3.4 nhid 12 via 192.168.11.2 dev dummy0\n\n $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32\n $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32 nhid 12\n <both should work>\n\n $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32 dev dummy0\n <should fail with ESRCH>\n\n[1]\n [  523.462226] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n [  523.462230] WARNING: CPU: 14 PID: 22893 at include/net/nexthop.h:468 fib_nh_match+0x210/0x460\n [  523.462236] Modules linked in: dummy rpcsec_gss_krb5 xt_socket nf_socket_ipv4 nf_socket_ipv6 ip6table_raw iptable_raw bpf_preload xt_statistic ip_set ip_vs_sh ip_vs_wrr ip_vs_rr ip_vs xt_mark nf_tables xt_nat veth nf_conntrack_netlink nfnetlink xt_addrtype br_netfilter overlay dm_crypt nfsv3 nfs fscache netfs vhost_net vhost vhost_iotlb tap tun xt_CHECKSUM xt_MASQUERADE xt_conntrack 8021q garp mrp ipt_REJECT nf_reject_ipv4 ip6table_mangle ip6table_nat iptable_mangle iptable_nat nf_nat nf_conntrack nf_defrag_ipv6 nf_defrag_ipv4 iptable_filter bridge stp llc rfcomm snd_seq_dummy snd_hrtimer rpcrdma rdma_cm iw_cm ib_cm ib_core ip6table_filter xt_comment ip6_tables vboxnetadp(OE) vboxnetflt(OE) vboxdrv(OE) qrtr bnep binfmt_misc xfs vfat fat squashfs loop nvidia_drm(POE) nvidia_modeset(POE) nvidia_uvm(POE) nvidia(POE) intel_rapl_msr intel_rapl_common snd_hda_codec_realtek snd_hda_codec_generic ledtrig_audio snd_hda_codec_hdmi btusb btrtl iwlmvm uvcvideo btbcm snd_hda_intel edac_mce_amd\n [  523.462274]  videobuf2_vmalloc videobuf2_memops btintel snd_intel_dspcfg videobuf2_v4l2 snd_intel_sdw_acpi bluetooth snd_usb_audio snd_hda_codec mac80211 snd_usbmidi_lib joydev snd_hda_core videobuf2_common kvm_amd snd_rawmidi snd_hwdep snd_seq videodev ccp snd_seq_device libarc4 ecdh_generic mc snd_pcm kvm iwlwifi snd_timer drm_kms_helper snd cfg80211 cec soundcore irqbypass rapl wmi_bmof i2c_piix4 rfkill k10temp pcspkr acpi_cpufreq nfsd auth_rpcgss nfs_acl lockd grace sunrpc drm zram ip_tables crct10dif_pclmul crc32_pclmul crc32c_intel ghash_clmulni_intel nvme sp5100_tco r8169 nvme_core wmi ipmi_devintf ipmi_msghandler fuse\n [  523.462300] CPU: 14 PID: 22893 Comm: ip Tainted: P           OE     5.16.18-200.fc35.x86_64 #1\n [  523.462302] Hardware name: Micro-Star International Co., Ltd.
