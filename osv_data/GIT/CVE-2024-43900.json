xc2028: avoid use-after-free in load_firmware_cb()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: xc2028: avoid use-after-free in load_firmware_cb()\n\nsyzkaller reported use-after-free in load_firmware_cb() [1].\nThe reason is because the module allocated a struct tuner in tuner_probe(),\nand then the module initialization failed, the struct tuner was released.\nA worker which created during module initialization accesses this struct\ntuner later, it caused use-after-free.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n\ntask-6504           worker_thread\ntuner_probe                             <= alloc dvb_frontend [2]\n...\nrequest_firmware_nowait                 <= create a worker\n...\ntuner_remove                            <= free dvb_frontend\n...\n                    request_firmware_work_func  <= the firmware is ready\n                    load_firmware_cb    <= but now the dvb_frontend has been freed\n\nTo fix the issue, check the dvd_frontend in load_firmware_cb(), if it is\nnull, report a warning and just return.\n\n[1]:\n    ==================================================================\n     BUG: KASAN:
