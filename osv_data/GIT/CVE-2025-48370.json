Prior to version 2.69.1, the library functions getUserById, deleteUser, updateUserById, listFactors and deleteFactor did not require the user supplied values to be valid UUIDs. This could lead to a URL path traversal, resulting in the wrong API function being called. Implementations that follow security best practice and validate user controlled inputs, such as the userId are not affected by this. This issue has been patched in version 2.69.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/supabase/auth-js","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b64fae2e49ea17f29f2e06b5f5489c225fb3b663"}]}],"versions":["rc2.63.0-rc.11","rc2.63.0-rc.rc.11","rc2.63.0-rc.rc.rc.11","rc2.63.0-rc.rc.rc.rc.11","rc2.63.0-rc.rc.rc.rc.rc.11","rc2.63.0-rc.rc.rc.rc.rc.rc.11","rc2.63.1-rc.2","rc2.63.1-rc.rc.2","rc2.63.1-rc.rc.rc.2","rc2.63.2-rc.1","rc2.64.0-rc.1","rc2.64.0-rc.rc.1","rc2.64.0-rc.rc.rc.1","rc2.64.1-rc.1","rc2.64.2-rc.1","rc2.64.2-rc.rc.1","rc2.64.3-rc.3","rc2.64.3-rc.6","rc2.64.3-rc.8","rc2.64.3-rc.9","rc2.64.3-rc.rc.3","rc2.64.3-rc.rc.rc.3","rc2.64.4-rc.2","rc2.64.5-rc.1","rc2.65.0-rc.2","rc2.65.0-rc.3","rc2.65.0-rc.4","rc2.65.0-rc.5","rc2.65.0-rc.6","rc2.65.1-rc.1","rc2.65.1-rc.2","rc2.65.1-rc.5","rc2.65.1-rc.6","rc2.65.1-rc.7","rc2.65.2-rc.1","rc2.65.2-rc.2","rc2.66.0-rc.3","rc2.66.1-rc.1","rc2.66.1-rc.2","rc2.66.1-rc.3","rc2.67.0-rc.1","rc2.67.0-rc.2","rc2.67.0-rc.4","rc2.67.1-rc.1","rc2.67.2-rc.2","rc2.67.3-rc.1","rc2.67.4-rc.2","rc2.67.4-rc.4","rc2.67.4-rc.5","rc2.68.0-rc.6","rc2.68.1-rc.1","rc2.69.0-rc.2","rc2.69.0-rc.3","rc2.69.1-rc.1","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.10.5","v1.10.6","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.12.3","v1.12.4","v1.12.7","v1.13.0","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.13.3","v1.13.4","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.15.1","v1.15.2","v1.15.3","v1.15.4","v1.15.5","v1.16.0","v1.16.1","v1.16.2","v1.16.3","v1.16.4","v1.16.5","v1.16.6","v1.16.7","v1.17.0","v1.17.1","v1.18.0","v1.19.0","v1.2.0","v1.20.0","v1.21.0","v1.21.1","v1.21.2","v1.21.3","v1.21.4","v1.21.5","v1.21.6","v1.21.7","v1.22.0","v1.22.1","v1.22.10","v1.22.11","v1.22.12","v1.22.13","v1.22.14","v1.22.15","v1.22.16","v1.22.17","v1.22.18","v1.22.19","v1.22.2","v1.22.20","v1.22.21","v1.22.22","v1.22.3","v1.22.4","v1.22.5","v1.22.6","v1.22.7","v1.22.8","v1.22.9","v1.23.0","v1.23.0-next.1","v1.23.0-next.10","v1.23.0-next.11","v1.23.0-next.12","v1.23.0-next.13","v1.23.0-next.14","v1.23.0-next.15","v1.23.0-next.16","v1.23.0-next.17","v1.23.0-next.18","v1.23.0-next.19","v1.23.0-next.2","v1.23.0-next.20","v1.23.0-next.21","v1.23.0-next.22","v1.23.0-next.23","v1.23.0-next.24","v1.23.0-next.3","v1.23.0-next.4","v1.23.0-next.5","v1.23.0-next.6","v1.23.0-next.7","v1.23.0-next.8","v1.23.0-next.9","v1.23.1","v1.24.0","v1.3.0","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.10","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.5.6","v1.5.7","v1.5.8","v1.5.9","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-rc.1","v2.0.0-rc.10","v2.0.0-rc.11","v2.0.0-rc.2","v2.0.0-rc.3","v2.0.0-rc.4","v2.0.0-rc.5","v2.0.0-rc.6","v2.0.0-rc.7","v2.0.0-rc.8","v2.0.0-rc.9","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.10.0","v2.10.1","v2.10.2","v2.11.0","v2.11.1","v2.11.2","v2.12.0","v2.12.1","v2.12.2","v2.13.0","v2.14.0","v2.15.0","v2.16.0","v2.17.0","v2.18.0","v2.18.1","v2.19.0","v2.19.1","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.20.0","v2.20.1","v2.20.2","v2.21.0","v2.22.0","v2.22.1","v2.22.2","v2.22.3","v2.23.0","v2.24.0","v2.25.0","v2.26.0","v2.27.0","v2.27.1","v2.27.2","v2.28.0","v2.28.1","v2.29.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.30.0","v2.31.0","v2.32.0","v2.33.0","v2.34.0","v2.35.0","v2.36.0","v2.37.0","v2.38.0","v2.39.0","v2.39.1","v2.39.2","v2.4.0","v2.4.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.3","v2.40.0","v2.41.0","v2.42.0","v2.43.0","v2.43.1","v2.44.0","v2.44.1","v2.45.0","v2.46.0","v2.46.1","v2.46.2","v2.47.0","v2.47.1","v2.48.0","v2.48.1","v2.49.0","v2.49.1","v2.5.0","v2.50.0","v2.51.0","v2.52.0","v2.53.0","v2.54.0","v2.54.1","v2.54.2","v2.55.0","v2.56.0","v2.57.0","v2.57.1","v2.58.0","v2.59.0","v2.6.0","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.60.0","v2.60.1","v2.60.2","v2.61.0","v2.62.0","v2.62.1","v2.62.2","v2.63.0","v2.63.1","v2.63.2","v2.64.0","v2.64.1","v2.64.2","v2.64.3","v2.64.4","v2.65.0","v2.65.1","v2.66.0","v2.66.1","v2.67.0","v2.67.1","v2.67.2","v2.67.3","v2.68.0","v2.69.0","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.7.2","v2.8.0","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48370.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/supabase/auth-js/security/advisories/GHSA-8r88-6cj9-9fh5"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/supabase/auth-js/pull/1063"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-287"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
