{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-27598","published":"2023-03-15T20:29:49.673Z","modified":"2025-12-04T23:44:55.722863Z","aliases":["GHSA-wxfg-3gwh-rhvx"],"summary":"OpenSIPS has vulnerability in the parse_via() function","details":"OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, sending a malformed `Via` header to OpenSIPS triggers a segmentation fault when the function `calc_tag_suffix` is called. A specially crafted `Via` header, which is deemed correct by the parser, will pass uninitialized strings to the function `MD5StringArray` which leads to the crash. Abuse of this vulnerability leads to Denial of Service due to a crash. Since the uninitialized string points to memory location `0x0`, no further exploitation appears to be possible. No special network privileges are required to perform this attack, as long as the OpenSIPS configuration makes use of functions such as `sl_send_reply` or `sl_gen_totag` that trigger the vulnerable code. This issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opensips/opensips","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c4122c9860458616cb438795c3545cd0f6014927"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.1.7"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opensips/opensips","events":[{"introduced":"1e94abe8837fe3511fada132d67a6385d8d099a2"},{"fixed":"50407d34067f0e80765617c3bace78639e380d5a"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.2.0"},{"fixed":"3.2.4"}]}}],"versions":["1.11.0","2.1-alpha1","2.1-alpha2","2.1-alpha3","2.1-rc1","3.1.0","3.1.0-beta","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.1.4","3.1.5","3.1.6","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-27598.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/27xxx/CVE-2023-27598.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/ab611f74f69d9c42be5401c40d56ea06a58f5dd7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-wxfg-3gwh-rhvx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27598"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-908"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/27xxx/CVE-2023-27598.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
