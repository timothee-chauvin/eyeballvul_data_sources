{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-21721","published":"2022-01-28T22:00:17Z","modified":"2025-12-04T10:08:58.584501Z","aliases":["GHSA-wr66-vrwm-5g5x"],"summary":"DOS Vulnerability in next.js","details":"Next.js is a React framework. Starting with version 12.0.0 and prior to version 12.0.9, vulnerable code could allow a bad actor to trigger a denial of service attack for anyone using i18n functionality. In order to be affected by this CVE, one must use next start or a custom server and the built-in i18n support. Deployments on Vercel, along with similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js, are not affected. A patch has been released, `next@12.0.9`, that mitigates this issue. As a workaround, one may ensure `/${locale}/_next/` is blocked from reaching the Next.js instance until it becomes feasible to upgrade.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"07431d3e0f057a0bd58af6d456e4bee646fd8b42"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-21721.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/21xxx/CVE-2022-21721.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/33503"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v12.0.9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-wr66-vrwm-5g5x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21721"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/21xxx/CVE-2022-21721.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
