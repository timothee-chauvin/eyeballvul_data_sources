Prior to 2.1.0, a peer can obtain a valid TLS certificate for arbitrary IP addresses, effectively rendering the mTLS authentication useless. The issue is that the Manager’s Certificate gRPC service does not validate if the requested IP addresses “belong to” the peer requesting the certificate—that is, if the peer connects from the same IP address as the one provided in the certificate request. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8f6f20b604bb540c39db5fb7020926e6db2dd9c8"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.1.0"}]}}],"versions":["v2.1.0-beta.1","v2.1.0-beta.2","v2.1.0-beta.3","v2.1.0-beta.4","v2.1.0-rc.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59353.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly2","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8f6f20b604bb540c39db5fb7020926e6db2dd9c8"}]}],"versions":["v2.1.0-beta.1","v2.1.0-beta.2","v2.1.0-beta.3","v2.1.0-beta.4","v2.1.0-rc.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59353.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/blob/main/docs/security/dragonfly-comprehensive-report-2023.pdf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/security/advisories/GHSA-255v-qv84-29p5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-295","CWE-862"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
