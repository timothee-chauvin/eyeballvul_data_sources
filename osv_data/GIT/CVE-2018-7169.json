This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used \"group blacklisting\" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"15be89f89d553c06d52453721ee8e9a8433cfdfd"}]}],"versions":["4.2.1","4.3.0","4.3.1","4.4","4.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-7169.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/shadow/+bug/1729357"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201805-09"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
