{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-24884","published":"2022-05-05T23:50:10Z","modified":"2025-11-19T10:57:45.804304Z","aliases":["GHSA-qhcg-9ffp-78pw"],"summary":"Trivial signature forgery in ecdsautils","details":"ecdsautils is a tiny collection of programs used for ECDSA (keygen, sign, verify). `ecdsa_verify_[prepare_]legacy()` does not check whether the signature values `r` and `s` are non-zero. A signature consisting only of zeroes is always considered valid, making it trivial to forge signatures. Requiring multiple signatures from different public keys does not mitigate the issue: `ecdsa_verify_list_legacy()` will accept an arbitrary number of such forged signatures. Both the `ecdsautil verify` CLI command and the libecdsautil library are affected. The issue has been fixed in ecdsautils 0.4.1. All older versions of ecdsautils (including versions before the split into a library and a CLI utility) are vulnerable.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/ecdsautils","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"39b6d0a77414fd41614953a0e185c4eefa2f88ad"}]}],"versions":["v0.2","v0.3","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24884.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/ecdsautils/commit/1d4b091abdf15ad7b2312535b5b95ad70f6dbd08"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/ecdsautils/commit/39b6d0a77414fd41614953a0e185c4eefa2f88ad"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/ecdsautils/security/advisories/GHSA-qhcg-9ffp-78pw"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00007.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4AKQH5WCBMJA3ODCSNERY6HVX4BX3ITG/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/G2JT57AAFIEL7JDO2ZBV25JKYME5NU54/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L7UBR3M4U3LA46BHXYSH7EN5GDG44GK7/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5132"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-347"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
