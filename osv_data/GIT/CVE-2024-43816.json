So, the memcpy\ncan cause big endian systems to crash.\n\nRedefine the *sgl ptr as a struct sli4_sge_le to make it clear that we are\nreferring to a little endian formatted data structure.  And, update the\nroutine with proper le32_to_cpu macro usages.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"af20bb73ac2591631d504f3f859f073bcdb7e11e"},{"fixed":"9fd003f344d502f65252963169df3dd237054e49"},{"fixed":"8bc7c617642db6d8d20ee671fb6c4513017e7a7e"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.10.1","v6.10.2","v6.9","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-43816.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.10.0"},{"fixed":"6.10.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-43816.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8bc7c617642db6d8d20ee671fb6c4513017e7a7e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9fd003f344d502f65252963169df3dd237054e49"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/43xxx/CVE-2024-43816.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43816"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/43xxx/CVE-2024-43816.json"}}
