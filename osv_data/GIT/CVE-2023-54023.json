If balance completes and returns 0,\nbut we have a pause or cancel request we won't do the appropriate\ncleanup, and then the next time we try to start a balance we'll trip\nthis ASSERT.\n\nThe error handling is just wrong here, we always want to clean up,\nunless we got -ECANCELLED and we set the appropriate pause flag in the\nexclusive op.  With this patch the reproducer ran for an hour without\ntripping, previously it would trip in less than a few minutes.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"837d5b6e46d1a4af5b6cc8f2fe83cb5de79a2961"},{"fixed":"ddf7e8984c83aee9122552529f4e77291903f8d9"},{"fixed":"72efe5d44821e38540888a5fe3ff3d0faab6acad"},{"fixed":"b19c98f237cd76981aaded52c258ce93f7daa8cb"}]}],"versions":["v3.10","v3.10-rc1","v3.10-rc2","v3.10-rc3","v3.10-rc4","v3.10-rc5","v3.10-rc6","v3.10-rc7","v3.11","v3.11-rc1","v3.11-rc2","v3.11-rc3","v3.11-rc4","v3.11-rc5","v3.11-rc6","v3.11-rc7","v3.12","v3.12-rc1","v3.12-rc2","v3.12-rc3","v3.12-rc4","v3.12-rc5","v3.12-rc6","v3.12-rc7","v3.13","v3.13-rc1","v3.13-rc2","v3.13-rc3","v3.13-rc4","v3.13-rc5","v3.13-rc6","v3.13-rc7","v3.13-rc8","v3.14","v3.14-rc1","v3.14-rc2","v3.14-rc3","v3.14-rc4","v3.14-rc5","v3.14-rc6","v3.14-rc7","v3.14-rc8","v3.15","v3.15-rc1","v3.15-rc2","v3.15-rc3","v3.15-rc4","v3.15-rc5","v3.15-rc6","v3.15-rc7","v3.15-rc8","v3.16","v3.16-rc1","v3.16-rc2","v3.16-rc3","v3.16-rc4","v3.16-rc5","v3.16-rc6","v3.16-rc7","v3.17","v3.17-rc1","v3.17-rc2","v3.17-rc3","v3.17-rc4","v3.17-rc5","v3.17-rc6","v3.17-rc7","v3.18","v3.18-rc1","v3.18-rc2","v3.18-rc3","v3.18-rc4","v3.18-rc5","v3.18-rc6","v3.18-rc7","v3.19","v3.19-rc1","v3.19-rc2","v3.19-rc3","v3.19-rc4","v3.19-rc5","v3.19-rc6","v3.19-rc7","v3.2","v3.2-rc1","v3.2-rc2","v3.2-rc3","v3.2-rc4","v3.2-rc5","v3.2-rc6","v3.2-rc7","v3.3","v3.3-rc1","v3.3-rc2","v3.3-rc3","v3.3-rc4","v3.3-rc5","v3.3-rc6","v3.3-rc7","v3.4","v3.4-rc1","v3.4-rc2","v3.4-rc3","v3.4-rc4","v3.4-rc5","v3.4-rc6","v3.4-rc7","v3.5","v3.5-rc1","v3.5-rc2","v3.5-rc3","v3.5-rc4","v3.5-rc5","v3.5-rc6","v3.5-rc7","v3.6","v3.6-rc1","v3.6-rc2","v3.6-rc3","v3.6-rc4","v3.6-rc5","v3.6-rc6","v3.6-rc7","v3.7","v3.7-rc1","v3.7-rc2","v3.7-rc3","v3.7-rc4","v3.7-rc5","v3.7-rc6","v3.7-rc7","v3.7-rc8","v3.8","v3.8-rc1","v3.8-rc2","v3.8-rc3","v3.8-rc4","v3.8-rc5","v3.8-rc6","v3.8-rc7","v3.9","v3.9-rc1","v3.9-rc2","v3.9-rc3","v3.9-rc4","v3.9-rc5","v3.9-rc6","v3.9-rc7","v3.9-rc8","v4.0","v4.0-rc1","v4.0-rc2","v4.0-rc3","v4.0-rc4","v4.0-rc5","v4.0-rc6","v4.0-rc7","v4.1","v4.1-rc1","v4.1-rc2","v4.1-rc3","v4.1-rc4","v4.1-rc5","v4.1-rc6","v4.1-rc7","v4.1-rc8","v4.10","v4.10-rc1","v4.10-rc2","v4.10-rc3","v4.10-rc4","v4.10-rc5","v4.10-rc6","v4.10-rc7","v4.10-rc8","v4.11","v4.11-rc1","v4.11-rc2","v4.11-rc3","v4.11-rc4","v4.11-rc5","v4.11-rc6","v4.11-rc7","v4.11-rc8","v4.12","v4.12-rc1","v4.12-rc2","v4.12-rc3","v4.12-rc4","v4.12-rc5","v4.12-rc6","v4.12-rc7","v4.13","v4.13-rc1","v4.13-rc2","v4.13-rc3","v4.13-rc4","v4.13-rc5","v4.13-rc6","v4.13-rc7","v4.14","v4.14-rc1","v4.14-rc2","v4.14-rc3","v4.14-rc4","v4.14-rc5","v4.14-rc6","v4.14-rc7","v4.14-rc8","v4.15","v4.15-rc1","v4.15-rc2","v4.15-rc3","v4.15-rc4","v4.15-rc5","v4.15-rc6","v4.15-rc7","v4.15-rc8","v4.15-rc9","v4.16","v4.16-rc1","v4.16-rc2","v4.16-rc3","v4.16-rc4","v4.16-rc5","v4.16-rc6","v4.16-rc7","v4.17","v4.17-rc1","v4.17-rc2","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.2","v4.2-rc1","v4.2-rc2","v4.2-rc3","v4.2-rc4","v4.2-rc5","v4.2-rc6","v4.2-rc7","v4.2-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v4.3","v4.3-rc1","v4.3-rc2","v4.3-rc3","v4.3-rc4","v4.3-rc5","v4.3-rc6","v4.3-rc7","v4.4","v4.4-rc1","v4.4-rc2","v4.4-rc3","v4.4-rc4","v4.4-rc5","v4.4-rc6","v4.4-rc7","v4.4-rc8","v4.5","v4.5-rc1","v4.5-rc2","v4.5-rc3","v4.5-rc4","v4.5-rc5","v4.5-rc6","v4.5-rc7","v4.6","v4.6-rc1","v4.6-rc2","v4.6-rc3","v4.6-rc4","v4.6-rc5","v4.6-rc6","v4.6-rc7","v4.7","v4.7-rc1","v4.7-rc2","v4.7-rc3","v4.7-rc4","v4.7-rc5","v4.7-rc6","v4.7-rc7","v4.8","v4.8-rc1","v4.8-rc2","v4.8-rc3","v4.8-rc4","v4.8-rc5","v4.8-rc6","v4.8-rc7","v4.8-rc8","v4.9","v4.9-rc1","v4.9-rc2","v4.9-rc3","v4.9-rc4","v4.9-rc5","v4.9-rc6","v4.9-rc7","v4.9-rc8","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.1
