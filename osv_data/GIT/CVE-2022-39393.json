  "details": "Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to versions 2.0.2 and 1.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator where when a linear memory is reused for another instance the initial heap snapshot of the prior instance can be visible, erroneously to the next instance. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2 and 1.0.2. Other mitigations include disabling the pooling allocator and disabling the `memory-init-cow`.",
