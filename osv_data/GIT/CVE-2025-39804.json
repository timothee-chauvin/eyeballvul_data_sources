Fixing this is also needed for poly1305_kunit to pass.\n\nJust use may_use_simd() instead of the original crypto_simd_usable(),\nsince poly1305_kunit won't rely on crypto_simd_disabled_for_test.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a59e5468a921937cb7317892779c67046ad9f5cc"},{"fixed":"ef74efa598b7bbc5c24509f7f56af2806f81c339"},{"fixed":"eec76ea5a7213c48529a46eed1b343e5cee3aaab"}]}],"versions":["v6.15","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.16.1","v6.16.2","v6.16.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39804.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.16.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-39804.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eec76ea5a7213c48529a46eed1b343e5cee3aaab"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ef74efa598b7bbc5c24509f7f56af2806f81c339"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/39xxx/CVE-2025-39804.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39804"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/39xxx/CVE-2025-39804.json"}}
