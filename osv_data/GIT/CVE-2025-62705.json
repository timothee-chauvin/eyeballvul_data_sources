Prior to version 2.4.2, OpenBao's audit log did not appropriately redact fields when relevant subsystems sent []byte response parameters rather than strings. This includes, but is not limited to sys/raw with use of encoding=base64, all data would be emitted unredacted to the audit log, and Transit, when performing a signing operation with a derived Ed25519 key, would emit public keys to the audit log.
