  "id": "CVE-2023-38702",
  "details": "Knowage is an open source analytics and business intelligence suite. Starting in the 6.x.x branch and prior to version 8.1.8, the endpoint `/knowage/restful-services/dossier/importTemplateFile` allows authenticated users to upload `template file` on the server, but does not need any authorization to be reached. When the JSP file is uploaded, the attacker just needs to connect to `/knowageqbeengine/foo.jsp` to gain code execution on the server. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker with low privileges can upload a JSP file to the `knowageqbeengine` directory and gain code execution capability on the server. This issue has been patched in Knowage version 8.1.8.",
