Starting in the 6.x.x branch and prior to version 8.1.8, the endpoint `/knowage/restful-services/dossier/importTemplateFile` allows authenticated users to upload `template file` on the server, but does not need any authorization to be reached. When the JSP file is uploaded, the attacker just needs to connect to `/knowageqbeengine/foo.jsp` to gain code execution on the server. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker with low privileges can upload a JSP file to the `knowageqbeengine` directory and gain code execution capability on the server. This issue has been patched in Knowage version 8.1.8.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/knowagelabs/knowage-server","events":[{"introduced":"eb0a58ddc4badcbf4502ca523cf415743c023aa0"},{"fixed":"d098e2426ba05fab5dbce0eb78c3ccca46b5912e"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-38702.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/KnowageLabs/Knowage-Server/security/advisories/GHSA-7mjh-73q3-c3fc"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
