LibreNMS versions 25.6.0 and below contain an architectural vulnerability in the ajax_form.php endpoint that permits Remote File Inclusion based on user-controlled POST input. The application directly uses the type parameter to dynamically include .inc.php files from the trusted path includes/html/forms/, without validation or allowlisting. This pattern introduces a latent Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector if an attacker can stage a file in this include path — for example, via symlink, development misconfiguration, or chained vulnerabilities. This is fixed in version 25.7.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0b7de68773377005d2a768d83168b8358da97e73"}]}],"versions":["0.1","1.19","1.20","1.21","1.25","1.26","1.27","1.28","1.29","1.30","1.30.01","1.31","1.31.01","1.31.02","1.31.03","1.32","1.33","1.35","1.36","1.37","1.38","1.39","1.40","1.41","1.42","1.42.01","1.43","1.44","1.45","1.46","1.47","1.48","1.48.1","1.49","1.50","1.51","1.52","1.53","1.53.1","1.54","1.55","1.56","1.57","1.58","1.58.1","1.59","1.60","1.61","1.62","1.63","1.64","1.64.1","1.65","1.66","1.67","1.68","1.69","1.70.0","1.70.1","201505","201506","201507","201508","201509","201510","201511","201512","201601","201602","201603","201604","201605","201606","201607","201608","20160828","201609","21.1.0","21.10.0","21.11.0","21.12.0","21.12.1","21.2.0","21.3.0","21.4.0","21.5.0","21.5.1","21.6.0","21.7.0","21.8.0","21.9.0","22.1.0","22.10.0","22.11.0","22.12.0","22.2.0","22.2.1","22.3.0","22.4.0","22.5.0","22.6.0","22.7.0","22.8.0","22.9.0","23.1.0","23.10.0","23.11.0","23.2.0","23.4.0","23.4.1","23.5.0","23.6.0","23.7.0","23.8.0","23.8.1","23.8.2","23.9.0","23.9.1","24.1.0","24.10.0","24.10.1","24.11.0","24.12.0","24.2.0","24.3.0","24.4.0","24.4.1","24.5.0","24.6.0","24.7.0","24.8.0","24.9.0","24.9.1","25.1.0","25.2.0","25.3.0","25.4.0","25.5.0","25.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54138.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54138.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/ec89714d929ef0cf2321957ed9198b0f18396c81"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/pull/17990"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/releases/tag/25.7.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-gq96-8w38-hhj2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54138"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-98"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/54xxx/CVE-2025-54138.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
