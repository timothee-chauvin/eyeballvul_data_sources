[0]\n\nThe repro first creates a listener with SO_REUSEPORT.  Then, it creates\nanother listener on the same port and concurrently closes the first\nlistener.\n\nThe second listen() calls reuseport_add_sock() with the first listener as\nsk2, where sk2->sk_reuseport_cb is not expected to be cleared concurrently,\nbut the close() does clear it by reuseport_detach_sock().\n\nThe problem is SCTP does not properly synchronise reuseport_alloc(),\nreuseport_add_sock(), and reuseport_detach_sock().\n\nThe caller of reuseport_alloc() and reuseport_{add,detach}_sock() must\nprovide synchronisation for sockets that are classified into the same\nreuseport group.\n\nOtherwise, such sockets form multiple identical reuseport groups, and\nall groups except one would be silently dead.\n\n  1. Two sockets call listen() concurrently\n  2. No socket in the same group found in sctp_ep_hashtable[]\n  3. Two sockets call reuseport_alloc() and form two reuseport groups\n  4. Only one group hit first in __sctp_rcv_lookup_endpoint() receives\n      incoming packets\n\nAlso, the reported null-ptr-deref could occur.\n\nTCP/UDP guarantees that would not happen by holding the hash bucket lock.\n\nLet's apply the locking strategy to __sctp_hash_endpoint() and\n__sctp_unhash_endpoint().\n\n[0]:\nOops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address
