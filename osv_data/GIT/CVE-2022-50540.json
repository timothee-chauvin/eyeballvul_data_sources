This cause the crci value to be ignored and cause\na kernel panic on any slave that use adm driver.\n\nTo fix this, compare to the size of the struct and NOT the size of the\npointer.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"03de6b273805b3c552ff158f8688555937375926"},{"fixed":"f1dd45a6585a1689e1e8906b3f9e302b9d40c715"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"03de6b273805b3c552ff158f8688555937375926"},{"fixed":"7490274b41a432824f7df5071ace3df2ab59caa7"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"03de6b273805b3c552ff158f8688555937375926"},{"fixed":"7c8765308371be30f50c1b5b97618b731514b207"}]}],"versions":["v5.16","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.19.1","v5.19.10","v5.19.11","v5.19.12","v5.19.13","v5.19.14","v5.19.15","v5.19.16","v5.19.2","v5.19.3","v5.19.4","v5.19.5","v5.19.6","v5.19.7","v5.19.8","v5.19.9","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50540.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"5.19.17"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.20.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50540.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7490274b41a432824f7df5071ace3df2ab59caa7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7c8765308371be30f50c1b5b97618b731514b207"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f1dd45a6585a1689e1e8906b3f9e302b9d40c715"}]}
