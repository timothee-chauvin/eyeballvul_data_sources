In affected versions missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like 99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openidc/mod_auth_openidc","events":[{"introduced":"4fe40bd8bed0c7697f4fb2c3733d02d472cb849e"},{"fixed":"4022c12f314bd89d127d1be008b1a80a08e1203d"}]}],"versions":["2.3.11rc1","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.1.6","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.0rc0","v2.3.0rc3","v2.3.1","v2.3.10","v2.3.10.1","v2.3.10.2","v2.3.11","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.7","v2.3.8","v2.3.9","v2.4.0","v2.4.0.1","v2.4.0.2","v2.4.0.3","v2.4.0.4","v2.4.1","v2.4.10","v2.4.11","v2.4.11.1","v2.4.11.2","v2.4.11.3","v2.4.12","v2.4.12.1","v2.4.12.2","v2.4.12.3","v2.4.13","v2.4.13.1","v2.4.13.2","v2.4.14","v2.4.14.1","v2.4.14.2","v2.4.14.3","v2.4.14.4","v2.4.15","v2.4.15.1","v2.4.2","v2.4.2.1","v2.4.3","v2.4.4","v2.4.4.1","v2.4.5","v2.4.6","v2.4.7","v2.4.7.1","v2.4.7.2","v2.4.8.1","v2.4.8.2","v2.4.8.3","v2.4.8.4","v2.4.9","v2.4.9.1","v2.4.9.2","v2.4.9.3","v2.4.9.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-24814.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"322812704310885842820140568782733754296","length":504},"id":"CVE-2024-24814-71b5006c","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/openidc/mod_auth_openidc/commit/4022c12f314bd89d127d1be008b1a80a08e1203d","target":{"file":"src/util.c","function":"oidc_util_get_chunked_cookie"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["261844483041236310717899455761983491528","105557643451672315148465526064764279959","51777230485431182441958992803497376189","315847452240663979389152691863395937919","311290518095346252640254467490379149150","225055174632963924276835982662294616333","49302270635601701674692179912453249207","158202527401304653540608054441997950290","88584786602322081031641309873993481468","8997013185923299332383544364545207502","186549567489047912340942705100386239270","66809282009186810548405938790455411946","322058496836185590727513664982037560305","15265141313598516542449760163806354324","187612768867496994149503657549485780942","255301382340815817554600480780671525405","172445423416692707799933425584149904831","25143073514638243297474642013239538905","152712783176500459626560029663006655341","314169033207615893373891422947323108816"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2024-24814-9cb3634e","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/openidc/mod_auth_openidc/commit/4022c12f314bd89d127d1be008b1a80a08e1203d","target":{"file":"src/util.c"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/commit/4022c12f314bd89d127d1be008b1a80a08e1203d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/security/advisories/GHSA-hxr6-w4gc-7vvv"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00004.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/T7DKVEVREYAI4F46CQAVOTPL75WLOZOE/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
