{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-46252","published":"2023-11-07T19:00:58.743Z","modified":"2025-12-04T19:10:07.764526Z","aliases":["GHSA-7q4f-fprr-5jw8"],"summary":"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via postMessage Handler in Squidex","details":"Squidex is an open source headless CMS and content management hub. Affected versions are missing origin verification in a postMessage handler which introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The editor-sdk.js file defines three different class-like functions, which employ a global message event listener: SquidexSidebar, SquidexWidget, and SquidexFormField. The registered event listener takes some action based on the type of the received message. For example, when the SquidexFormField receives a message with the type valueChanged, the value property is updated. The SquidexFormField class is for example used in the editor-editorjs.html file, which can be accessed via the public wwwroot folder. It uses the onValueChanged method to register a callback function, which passes the value provided from the message event to the editor.render. Passing an attacker-controlled value to this function introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/squidex/squidex","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7e8bc83243e3f2625372d05e0ba3687118a909dd"}]}],"versions":["3.0.0","3.0.0-beta2","3.0.0-beta3","3.1.0","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.3.0","3.4.0","3.5.0","4.0.0","4.0.0-beta1","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.1.0","4.1.0-beta1","4.1.0-rc","4.1.1","4.1.2","4.1.3","4.2.0","4.2.0-beta1","4.2.0-beta2","4.3.0","4.4.0","4.4.0-rc","4.5.0","4.5.1","4.6.0","4.7.0","4.7.1","4.7.2","4.7.3","4.7.4","4.7.5","4.7.6","5.0.0","5.0.0-beta1","5.0.0-beta2","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.3.0","5.4.0","5.5.0","5.6.0","5.7.0","5.8.0","5.8.1","5.8.2","5.9.0","6.0.0","6.0.1","6.1.0","6.10.0","6.11.0","6.12.0","6.13.0","6.14.0","6.2.0","6.3.0","6.4.0","6.5.0","6.6.0","6.7.0","6.8.0","6.9.0","7.0.0","7.0.0-rc1","7.0.0-rc2","7.0.0-rc3","7.0.1","7.0.2","7.0.3","7.1.0","7.2.0","7.3.0","7.4.0","7.5.0","7.6.0","7.6.1","7.7.0","7.8.0","7.8.1","7.8.2","v1.0","v1.0-beta1","v1.0-beta2","v1.0-beta3","v1.1","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.16.1","v1.16.2","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.9.0","v2.0","v2.0-RC1","v2.0-beta1","v2.0.1","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v3.0-beta1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-46252.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/46xxx/CVE-2023-46252.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Squidex/squidex/security/advisories/GHSA-7q4f-fprr-5jw8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46252"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/46xxx/CVE-2023-46252.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L"}]}
