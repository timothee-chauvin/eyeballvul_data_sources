Then, rtnl_unlock() by Thread B will release RTNL\nand wait for netdev_put() by Thread A.\n\nThread A, however, must hold RTNL after the unlock in dev_ifsioc(),\nwhich may take long under RTNL pressure, resulting in the splat by\nThread B.\n\n  Thread A (SIOCBRDELIF)           Thread B (SIOCBRDELBR)\n  ----------------------           ----------------------\n  sock_ioctl                       sock_ioctl\n  `- sock_do_ioctl                 `- br_ioctl_call\n     `- dev_ioctl                     `- br_ioctl_stub\n        |- rtnl_lock                     |\n        |- dev_ifsioc                    '\n        '  |- dev = __dev_get_by_name(...)\n           |- netdev_hold(dev, ...)      .\n       /   |- rtnl_unlock  ------.       |\n       |   |- br_ioctl_call       `--->  |- rtnl_lock\n  Race |   |  `- br_ioctl_stub           |- br_del_bridge\n  Window   |     |                       |  |- dev = __dev_get_by_name(...)\n       |   |     |  May take long        |  `- br_dev_delete(dev, ...)\n       |   |     |  under RTNL pressure  |     `- unregister_netdevice_queue(dev, ...)\n       |   |     |               |       `- rtnl_unlock\n       \\   |     |- rtnl_lock  <-'          `- netdev_run_todo\n           |     |- ...                        `- netdev_run_todo\n           |     `- rtnl_unlock                   |- __rtnl_unlock\n           |                                      |- netdev_wait_allrefs_any\n           |- netdev_put(dev, ...)  <----------------'\n                                                Wait refcnt decrement\n                                                and log splat below\n\nTo avoid blocking SIOCBRDELBR unnecessarily, let's not call\ndev_ioctl() for SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF.\n\nIn the dev_ioctl() path, we do the following:\n\n  1. Copy struct ifreq by get_user_ifreq in sock_do_ioctl()\n  2. Check CAP_NET_ADMIN in dev_ioctl()\n  3. Call dev_load() in dev_ioctl()\n  4. Fetch the master dev from ifr.ifr_name in dev_ifsioc()\n\n3. can be done by request_module() in br_ioctl_call(), so we move\n1., 2., and 4. to br_ioctl_stub().\n\nNote that 2. is also checked later in add_del_if(), but it's better\nperformed before RTNL.\n\nSIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF have been processed in dev_ioctl() since\nthe pre-git era, and there seems to be no specific reason to process\nthem there.\n\n[0]:\nunregister_netdevice: waiting for wpan3 to become free.
