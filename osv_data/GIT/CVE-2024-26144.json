Starting with version 5.2.0, there is a possible sensitive session information leak in Active Storage. By default, Active Storage sends a Set-Cookie header along with the user's session cookie when serving blobs. It also sets Cache-Control to public. Certain proxies may cache the Set-Cookie, leading to an information leak. The vulnerability is fixed in 7.0.8.1 and 6.1.7.7.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rails/rails","events":[{"introduced":"375a4143cf5caeb6159b338be824903edfd62836"},{"fixed":"ac87f58207cff18880593263be9d83456aa3a2ef"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"5.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.7.7"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rails/rails","events":[{"introduced":"984c3ef2775781d47efa9f541ce570daa2434a80"},{"fixed":"506462ab13755d9f024e1ddbfc8c58d73e7a1bce"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"7.0.0"},{"fixed":"7.0.8.1"}]}}],"versions":["v7.0.0","v7.0.1","v7.0.2","v7.0.2.1","v7.0.2.2","v7.0.2.3","v7.0.2.4","v7.0.3","v7.0.3.1","v7.0.4","v7.0.4.1","v7.0.4.2","v7.0.4.3","v7.0.5","v7.0.5.1","v7.0.6","v7.0.7","v7.0.7.1","v7.0.7.2","v7.0.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-26144.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/possible-sensitive-session-information-leak-in-active-storage/84945"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/26xxx/CVE-2024-26144.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/723f54566023e91060a67b03353e7c03e7436433"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/78fe149509fac5b05e54187aaaef216fbb5fd0d3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-8h22-8cf7-hq6g"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/activestorage/CVE-2024-26144.yml"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26144"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240510-0013/"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/26xxx/CVE-2024-26144.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
