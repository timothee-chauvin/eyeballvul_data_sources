{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-32646","published":"2024-04-25T17:21:59.687Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:26:26.439620Z","aliases":["GHSA-r56x-j438-vw5m","PYSEC-2024-207"],"summary":"vyper performs double eval of the slice args when buffer from adhoc locations","details":"Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. In versions 0.3.10 and prior, using the `slice` builtin can result in a double eval vulnerability when the buffer argument is either `msg.data`, `self.code` or `<address>.code` and either the `start` or `length` arguments have side-effects. It can be easily triggered only with the versions `<0.3.4` as `0.3.4` introduced the unique symbol fence. No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, double evaluation of side-effects should be easily discoverable in client tests. As such, the impact is low. As of time of publication, no fixed versions are available.\n\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e9db8d9f7486eae38f5b86531629019ad28f514e"}]}],"versions":["0.2.1","pre-release","v0.0.4","v0.1.0-beta.1","v0.1.0-beta.10","v0.1.0-beta.11","v0.1.0-beta.12","v0.1.0-beta.13","v0.1.0-beta.14","v0.1.0-beta.15","v0.1.0-beta.16","v0.1.0-beta.17","v0.1.0-beta.2","v0.1.0-beta.3","v0.1.0-beta.4","v0.1.0-beta.5","v0.1.0-beta.6","v0.1.0-beta.7","v0.1.0-beta.8","v0.1.0-beta.9","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.10","v0.2.11","v0.2.12","v0.2.13","v0.2.14","v0.2.15","v0.2.16","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.2.6","v0.2.7","v0.2.8","v0.2.9","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.10","v0.3.10rc1","v0.3.10rc2","v0.3.10rc3","v0.3.10rc4","v0.3.10rc5","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.3.8","v0.3.9","v0.4.0b1","v0.4.0b2","v0.4.0b3","v0.4.0b4","v0.4.0b5","v0.4.0b6","v0.4.0rc1","v0.4.0rc2","v0.4.0rc3","v0.4.0rc4","v0.4.0rc5","v0.4.0rc6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-32646.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-r56x-j438-vw5m"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
