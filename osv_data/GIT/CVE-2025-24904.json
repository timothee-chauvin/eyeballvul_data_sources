{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-24904","published":"2025-02-13T15:24:20Z","modified":"2025-10-21T19:32:31Z","aliases":["GHSA-hrrc-wpfw-5hj2"],"summary":"libsignal-service-rs doesn't sanity check plaintext envelopes are not sanity-checked","details":"libsignal-service-rs is a Rust version of the libsignal-service-java library which implements the core functionality to communicate with Signal servers. Prior to commit 82d70f6720e762898f34ae76b0894b0297d9b2f8, plaintext content envelopes could be injected by a server or a malicious client, and may have been able to bypass the end-to-end encryption and authentication. The vulnerability is fixed per 82d70f6720e762898f34ae76b0894b0297d9b2f8. The `Metadata` struct contains an additional `was_encrypted` field, which breaks the API, but should be easily resolvable. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"82d70f6720e762898f34ae76b0894b0297d9b2f8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-24904.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-hrrc-wpfw-5hj2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs/commit/82d70f6720e762898f34ae76b0894b0297d9b2f8"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287","CWE-74"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N"}]}
