{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-45813","published":"2023-10-18T20:26:44.531Z","modified":"2025-12-05T00:08:38.815742Z","aliases":["GHSA-72qw-p7hh-m3ff"],"summary":"Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in TorBot","details":"Torbot is an open source tor network intelligence tool. In affected versions the `torbot.modules.validators.validate_link function` uses the python-validators URL validation regex. This particular regular expression has an exponential complexity which allows an attacker to cause an application crash using a well-crafted argument. An attacker can use a well-crafted URL argument to exploit the vulnerability in the regular expression and cause a Denial of Service on the system. The validators file has been removed in version 4.0.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dedsecinside/torbot","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9ea8108cbfd3ecb53bfef39b8b7b5d047f3f4ac8"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.0"}]}}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.2","v1.3","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v3.0.1","v3.1.1","v3.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-45813.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/45xxx/CVE-2023-45813.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/DedSecInside/TorBot/commit/ef6e06bc7785355b1701d5524eb4550441086ac4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DedSecInside/TorBot/security/advisories/GHSA-72qw-p7hh-m3ff"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45813"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-1333"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/45xxx/CVE-2023-45813.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
