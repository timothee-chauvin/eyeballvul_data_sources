By using the document event feature to trigger LibreLogo to execute python contained within a document a malicious document could be constructed which would execute arbitrary python commands silently without warning. In the fixed versions, LibreLogo cannot be called from a document event handler. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.5.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/libreoffice/core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"af17b2cd26a1e36edf0b995f81a2e0757086dad1"}]}],"versions":["CODE-4.2.0-1","CODE-4.2.0-2","CODE-4.2.0-3","CODE-4.2.0-4","MELD_LIBREOFFICE_REPOS","calc_libreoffice-3.4.2.2-buildfix1","co-6.2-1","co-6.2-2","cp-6.2-3","cp-6.2-4","cp-6.2-branch-point","gpg4libre-review-5.4.99","libreoffice-3-5-branch-point","libreoffice-3-6-branch-point","libreoffice-3.5.0.0","libreoffice-4-0-branch-point","libreoffice-4-1-branch-point","libreoffice-4-2-branch-point","libreoffice-4-2-milestone-1","libreoffice-4-3-branch-point","libreoffice-4-4-branch-point","libreoffice-5-0-branch-point","libreoffice-5-1-branch-point","libreoffice-5-2-branch-point","libreoffice-5-3-branch-point","libreoffice-5-4-branch-point","libreoffice-6-0-branch-point","libreoffice-6-1-branch-point","libreoffice-6-2-branch-point","libs-extern-sys_libreoffice-3.4.2.2-buildfix1","libs-extern_libreoffice-3.4.2.2-buildfix1","sdremote-2.0.0","testing_libreoffice-3.3.99.4-hotfixes1","windows_build_successful_2011_11_08"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-9848.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["233200441047925480252906591352144612406","264490658401332878748836263305079951235","203216785748593587068655570867337821875","12987806305500356543948192892457400390","35224439694116169344374987044831240565","149819950462864929760415489721791099395","29851043395935371125434107625009581462","35004788861910209482010217534733274947"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2019-9848-eee0652d","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/libreoffice/core/commit/af17b2cd26a1e36edf0b995f81a2e0757086dad1","target":{"file":"comphelper/source/misc/lok.cxx"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/109374"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PMEGUWMWORC3DOVEHVXLFT3A5RSCMLBH/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XPTZJCNN52VNGSVC5DFKVW3EDMRDWKMP/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00006.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00067.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/10/msg00005.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Aug/28"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201908-13"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4063-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/CVE-2019-9848"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
