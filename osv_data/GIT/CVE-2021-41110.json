  "details": "cwlviewer is a web application to view and share Common Workflow Language workflows. Versions prior to 1.3.1 contain a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability. Commit number f6066f09edb70033a2ce80200e9fa9e70a5c29de (dated 2021-09-30) contains a patch. There are no available workarounds aside from installing the patch.
