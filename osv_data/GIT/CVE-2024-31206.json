  "details": "dectalk-tts is a Node package to interact with the aeiou Dectalk web API. In `dectalk-tts@1.0.0`, network requests to the third-party API are sent over HTTP, which is unencrypted. Unencrypted traffic can be easily intercepted and modified by attackers. Anyone who uses the package could be the victim of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The network request was upgraded to HTTPS in version `1.0.1`. There are no workarounds, but some precautions include not sending any sensitive information and carefully verifying the API response before saving it.",
