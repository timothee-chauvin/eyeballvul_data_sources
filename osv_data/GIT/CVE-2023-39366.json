Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The `data_sources.php` script displays the data source management information (e.g. data source path, polling configuration etc.) for different data visualizations of the _cacti_ app. \nCENSUS found that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious Device name, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any user of the same (or broader) privileges. A user that possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload is exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to update should manually filter HTML output.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cacti/cacti","events":[{"introduced":"d4777377811f390fcdd84a8a805677e6435b27a0"},{"fixed":"18500fa313a9f1ee1be48aa111c0eeea001010fa"}]}],"versions":["releaes/1.2.19","release/1.2.0","release/1.2.1","release/1.2.10","release/1.2.11","release/1.2.12","release/1.2.13","release/1.2.14","release/1.2.15","release/1.2.16","release/1.2.17","release/1.2.18","release/1.2.19","release/1.2.2","release/1.2.20","release/1.2.21","release/1.2.22","release/1.2.23","release/1.2.24","release/1.2.3","release/1.2.4","release/1.2.5","release/1.2.6","release/1.2.7","release/1.2.8","release/1.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-39366.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/39xxx/CVE-2023-39366.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-rwhh-xxm6-vcrv"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CFH3J2WVBKY4ZJNMARVOWJQK6PSLPHFH/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WOQFYGLZBAWT4AWNMO7DU73QXWPXTCKH/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGB2UXJEUYWWA6IWVFQ3ZTP22FIHMGN/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39366"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5550"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/39xxx/CVE-2023-39366.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
