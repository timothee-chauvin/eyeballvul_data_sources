Fix workqueue crash in cma_netevent_work_handler","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/cma: Fix workqueue crash in cma_netevent_work_handler\n\nstruct rdma_cm_id has member \"struct work_struct net_work\"\nthat is reused for enqueuing cma_netevent_work_handler()s\nonto cma_wq.\n\nBelow crash[1] can occur if more than one call to\ncma_netevent_callback() occurs in quick succession,\nwhich further enqueues cma_netevent_work_handler()s for the\nsame rdma_cm_id, overwriting any previously queued work-item(s)\nthat was just scheduled to run i.e. there is no guarantee\nthe queued work item may run between two successive calls\nto cma_netevent_callback() and the 2nd INIT_WORK would overwrite\nthe 1st work item (for the same rdma_cm_id), despite grabbing\nid_table_lock during enqueue.\n\nAlso drgn analysis [2] indicates the work item was likely overwritten.\n\nFix this by moving the INIT_WORK() to __rdma_create_id(),\nso that it doesn't race with any existing queue_work() or\nits worker thread.\n\n[1] Trimmed crash stack:\n=============================================\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer
