Prior to 1.0.1, if the $_GET['seoOp'] parameter is manipulated to include malicious input (e.g., seoOp=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/config.php), the application could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server (Local File Inclusion, LFI). The $_GET['seoOp'] and $_GET['seoArg'] parameters are directly used without sanitization or validation. This is partly mitigated by the fact that the ImpressCMS sensitive files are stored outside the web root, in a folder with a randomized name. The issue has been resolved in imFaq 1.0.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/impressmodules/imfaq","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ab8af2683bc40341467223505d5bc1c29f204ddd"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-29930.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ImpressModules/imfaq/commit/63dedd30a8f196db7b340740adf667a39c26a4ac"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ImpressModules/imfaq/security/advisories/GHSA-vrr3-54vc-vwg3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-73"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
