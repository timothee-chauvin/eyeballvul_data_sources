  "details": "SonarQube Server and Cloud is a static analysis solution for continuous code quality and security inspection. In versions 4 to 5.3.0, a command injection vulnerability was discovered in the SonarQube Scan GitHub Action that allows untrusted input arguments to be processed without proper sanitization. Arguments sent to the action are treated as shell expressions, allowing potential execution of arbitrary commands. A fix has been released in SonarQube Scan GitHub Action 5.3.1.",
