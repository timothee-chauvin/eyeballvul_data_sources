Several of\nthese buffers are never dealloced.  Some of them can be deallocated\nright after GSP-RM is initialized, but the rest need to stay until the\ndriver unloads.\n\nAlso futher bullet-proof these objects by poisoning the buffer and\nclearing the nvkm_gsp_mem object when it is deallocated.  Poisoning\nthe buffer should trigger an error (or crash) from GSP-RM if it tries\nto access the buffer after we've deallocated it, because we were wrong\nabout when it is safe to deallocate.\n\nFinally, change the mem->size field to a size_t because that's the same\ntype that dma_alloc_coherent expects.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"176fdcbddfd288408ce8571c1760ad618d962096"},{"fixed":"6190d4c08897d748dd25f0b78267a90aa1694e15"},{"fixed":"042b5f83841fbf7ce39474412db3b5e4765a7ea7"}]}],"versions":["v6.6","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.7.1","v6.7.2","v6.7.3","v6.7.4","v6.7.5","v6.8-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-26912.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.7.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-26912.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/042b5f83841fbf7ce39474412db3b5e4765a7ea7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6190d4c08897d748dd25f0b78267a90aa1694e15"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/26xxx/CVE-2024-26912.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26912"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/26xxx/CVE-2024-26912.json"}}
