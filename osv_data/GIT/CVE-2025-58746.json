Prior to version 2.4.0, a malicious actor with Editor privileges can escalate their privileges to Administrator and perform arbitrary administrative actions. This is possible because the plugin allows arbitrary JavaScript code injection in the [Layout] \u2192 [Link] \u2192 [URL] field. Version 2.4.0 contains a fix for the issue.",
