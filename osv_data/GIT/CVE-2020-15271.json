Users that use lookatme to render untrusted markdown may have malicious shell commands automatically run on their system. This is fixed in version 2.3.0. As a workaround, the `lookatme/contrib/terminal.py` and `lookatme/contrib/file_loader.py` files may be manually deleted. Additionally, it is always recommended to be aware of what is being rendered with lookatme.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"72fe36b784b234548d49dae60b840c37f0eb8d84"},{"fixed":"a1ac49056008a1966266f352365bb6d268cb042f"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.3.0","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-15271.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/commit/72fe36b784b234548d49dae60b840c37f0eb8d84"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/pull/110"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/releases/tag/v2.3.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/security/advisories/GHSA-c84h-w6cr-5v8q"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://pypi.org/project/lookatme/#history"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
