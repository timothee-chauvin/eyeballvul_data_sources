Prior to 2.26.5, 2.27.7, and 2.28.4, Workspace Agent manifests containing sensitive values were logged in plaintext unsanitized. An attacker with limited local access to the Coder Workspace (VM, K8s Pod etc.) or a third-party system (SIEM, logging stack) could access those logs. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.26.5, 2.27.7, and 2.28.4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/coder/coder","events":[{"introduced":"1b1e3cb706b899e0779f1561e088ee8cbd3f6aaf"},{"fixed":"e2a46393fce40bc630df3293c1ee66a596277289"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.28.0"},{"fixed":"2.28.4"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/coder/coder","events":[{"introduced":"c0cd32c2c4d583423be4cec2a6f9f30209cbce3b"},{"fixed":"06c6abbe0935f9213c1588add60a396da5762e1c"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.27.0"},{"fixed":"2.27.7"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/coder/coder","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a75205a559211c8aa494b1a16750d114b263f24a"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.26.5"}]}}],"versions":["rm","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.11.0","v0.12.0","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.12.3","v0.12.4","v0.12.5","v0.12.6","v0.12.7","v0.12.8","v0.12.9","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.13.2","v0.13.3","v0.13.4","v0.13.5","v0.13.6","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.14.2","v0.14.3","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.15.3","v0.16.0","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2","v0.17.3","v0.17.4","v0.18.0","v0.18.1","v0.19.0","v0.19.1","v0.19.2","v0.20.0","v0.20.1","v0.21.0","v0.21.1","v0.21.2","v0.21.3","v0.22.0","v0.22.1","v0.22.2","v0.23.0","v0.23.1","v0.23.2","v0.23.3","v0.23.4","v0.23.5","v0.23.6","v0.23.7","v0.24.0","v0.24.1","v0.25.0","v0.26.0","v0.26.1","v0.26.2","v0.27.0","v0.27.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.10","v0.5.11","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.5.7","v0.5.8","v0.5.9","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.6.5","v0.6.6","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.10","v0.7.11","v0.7.12","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.5","v0.7.6","v0.7.7","v0.7.8","v0.7.9","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.10","v0.8.11","v0.8.12","v0.8.13","v0.8.14","v0.8.15","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.8.5","v0.8.6","v0.8.7","v0.8.8","v0.8.9","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.10","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.5","v0.9.6","v0.9.7","v0.9.8","v0.9.9","v2.0.2","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.10.0","v2.2.1","v2.26.0","v2.26.1","v2.26.2","v2.26.3","v2.26.4","v2.27.0","v2.27.1","v2.27.2","v2.27.3","v2.27.4","v2.27.5","v2.27.6","v2.28.0","v2.28.1","v2.28.2","v2.28.3","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.5.1","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.7.1","v2.8.0","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66411.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66411.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/coder/coder/commit/e2a46393fce40bc630df3293c1ee66a596277289"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/coder/coder/releases/tag/v2.26.5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/coder/coder/releases/tag/v2.27.7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/coder/coder/releases/tag/v2.28.4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/coder/coder/security/advisories/GHSA-jf75-p25m-pw74"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66411"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-532"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66411.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
