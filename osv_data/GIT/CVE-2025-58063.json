Starting in version 1.2.0 and prior to version 1.12.4, the CoreDNS etcd plugin contains a TTL confusion vulnerability where lease IDs are incorrectly used as TTL values, enabling DNS cache pinning attacks. This effectively creates a DoS condition for DNS resolution of affected services. The `TTL()` function in `plugin/etcd/etcd.go` incorrectly casts etcd lease IDs (64-bit integers) to uint32 and uses them as TTL values. Large lease IDs become very large TTLs when cast to uint32. This enables cache pinning attacks. Version 1.12.4 contains a fix for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/coredns/coredns","events":[{"introduced":"2e322f6e8a54f18c6aef9c25a7c432c291a3d9f7"},{"fixed":"f32329577fd5e3fe19908f8a9ba5c76aafb45bf6"}]}],"versions":["v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.11.0","v1.11.1","v1.11.3","v1.11.4","v1.12.0","v1.12.1","v1.12.2","v1.12.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.6.9","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.8.4","v1.8.5","v1.8.6","v1.8.7","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58063.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/58xxx/CVE-2025-58063.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/coredns/coredns/commit/e1768a5d272e9da649dfb8588595e5c6e4e640bf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/coredns/coredns/security/advisories/GHSA-93mf-426m-g6x9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58063"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-681"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/58xxx/CVE-2025-58063.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H"}]}
