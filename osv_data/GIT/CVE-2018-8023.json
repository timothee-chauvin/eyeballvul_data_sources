{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2018-8023","published":"2018-09-21T13:29:01Z","modified":"2025-10-21T04:39:02.846606Z","aliases":["GHSA-c8cc-p3j7-4c7f"],"details":"Apache Mesos can be configured to require authentication to call the Executor HTTP API using JSON Web Token (JWT). In Apache Mesos versions pre-1.4.2, 1.5.0, 1.5.1, 1.6.0 the comparison of the generated HMAC value against the provided signature in the JWT implementation used is vulnerable to a timing attack because instead of a constant-time string comparison routine a standard `==` operator has been used. A malicious actor can therefore abuse the timing difference of when the JWT validation function returns to reveal the correct HMAC value.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/mesos","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"612ec2c63a68b4d5b60d1d864e6703fde1c2a023"}]}],"versions":["0.14.0-rc1","0.15.0-rc1","0.16.0-rc1","0.17.0-rc1","0.18.0-rc1","0.19.0-rc1","0.20.0-rc1","0.21.0-rc1","0.22.0-rc1","0.23.0-rc1","0.24.0-rc1","0.27.0-rc1","0.28.0-rc1","1.0.0-rc1","1.0.0-rc2","1.2.0-rc1","1.4.0","1.4.0-rc1","1.4.0-rc2","1.4.0-rc3","1.4.0-rc4","1.4.0-rc5","1.4.1","1.4.1-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-8023.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/9b9d3f6bd09f3ebd2284b82077033bdc71da550a1c4c010c2494acc3%40%3Cdev.mesos.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0dd7ff197b2e3bdd80a0326587ca3d0c22e10d1dba17c769d6da7d7a%40%3Cuser.flink.apache.org%3E"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
