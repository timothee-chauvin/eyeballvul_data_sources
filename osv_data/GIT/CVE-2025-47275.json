Starting in version 8.0.0-BETA1 and prior to version 8.14.0, session cookies of applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK configured with CookieStore have authentication tags that can be brute forced, which may result in unauthorized access. Certain pre-conditions are required to be vulnerable to this issue: Applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK, or the Auth0/symfony, Auth0/laravel-auth0, and Auth0/wordpress SDKs that rely on the Auth0-PHP SDK; and session storage configured with CookieStore. Upgrade Auth0/Auth0-PHP to v8.14.0 to receive a patch. As an additional precautionary measure, rotating cookie encryption keys is recommended. Note that once updated, any previous session cookies will be rejected.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/auth0/auth0-php","events":[{"introduced":"f2f20ea1a8071a3a9e1accaa769cdf2ab81844d3"},{"fixed":"03579f7e6bd59f6f0009dbd83900594019e3f422"}]}],"versions":["8.0.0","8.0.0-BETA1","8.0.0-BETA2","8.0.0-BETA3","8.0.1","8.0.2","8.0.3","8.0.4","8.0.5","8.0.6","8.1.0","8.10.0","8.11.0","8.11.1","8.12.0","8.13.0","8.2.0","8.2.1","8.3.0","8.3.1","8.3.2","8.3.3","8.3.4","8.3.5","8.3.6","8.3.7","8.3.8","8.4.0","8.5.0","8.6.0","8.7.0","8.7.1","8.8.0","8.9.0","8.9.1","8.9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-47275.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/47xxx/CVE-2025-47275.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/commit/52a79480fdb246f59dbc089b81a784ae049bd389"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/releases/tag/8.14.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/security/advisories/GHSA-g98g-r7gf-2r25"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/security/advisories/GHSA-9fwj-9mjf-rhj3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/auth0/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-9wg9-93h9-j8ch"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/auth0/wordpress/security/advisories/GHSA-2f4r-34m4-3w8q"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47275"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-287"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/47xxx/CVE-2025-47275.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
