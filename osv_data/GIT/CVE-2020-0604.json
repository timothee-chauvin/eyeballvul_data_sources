An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to convince a target to clone a repository and open it in Visual Studio Code. Attacker-specified code would execute when the target opened the integrated terminal.\nThe update address the vulnerability by modifying the way Visual Studio Code handles environment variables.\n",
