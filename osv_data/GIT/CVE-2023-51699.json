An OS command injection vulnerability within the Fluid project's JuicefsRuntime can potentially allow an authenticated user, who has the authority to create or update the K8s CRD Dataset/JuicefsRuntime, to execute arbitrary OS commands within the juicefs related containers. This could lead to unauthorized access, modification or deletion of data. Users who're using versions < 0.9.3 with JuicefsRuntime should upgrade to v0.9.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/fluid-cloudnative/fluid","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"00741af240c9bd9d87f63b6e865c5bca4032dc61"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-51699.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/fluid-cloudnative/fluid/commit/e0184cff8790ad000c3e8943392c7f544fad7d66"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/fluid-cloudnative/fluid/security/advisories/GHSA-wx8q-4gm9-rj2g"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-78"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
