The rule is violated by the pkvm_create_hyp_vm() which acquires\nthe kvm->lock while already holding the vcpu->mutex lock from\nkvm_vcpu_ioctl(). Avoid the circular locking dependency altogether by\nprotecting the hyp vm handle with the config_lock, much like we already\ndo for other forms of VM-scoped
