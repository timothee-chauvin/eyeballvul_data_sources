The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv","events":[{"introduced":"96e05543f53b19d9642b4b0dd73b86ad3cea313e"},{"fixed":"e9f29cb984231524e3931aa0ae2c5dae1a32884e"}]}],"versions":["v1.45.0","v1.46.0","v1.47.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-24806.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/08/2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/11/1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/24xxx/CVE-2024-24806.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/0f2d7e784a256b54b2385043438848047bc2a629"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/3530bcc30350d4a6ccf35d2f7b33e23292b9de70"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/c858a147643de38a09dd4164758ae5b685f2b488"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/e0327e1d508b8207c9150b6e582f0adf26213c39"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/libuv/libuv/security/advisories/GHSA-f74f-cvh7-c6q6"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/26112"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00005.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24806"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240605-0008/"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/24xxx/CVE-2024-24806.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
