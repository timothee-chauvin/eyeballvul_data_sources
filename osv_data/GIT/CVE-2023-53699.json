The\nregions arrays need to \"reallocated\" from memblock and accessed through\nlinear mapping to cover more memblock regions. So the resizing should\nnot be allowed until linear mapping is ready. Note that there are\nmemblock allocations when building linear mapping.\n\nThis patch is similar to 24cc61d8cb5a (\"arm64: memblock: don't permit\nmemblock resizing until linear mapping is up\").\n\nIn following log, many memblock regions are reserved before\ncreate_linear_mapping_page_table(). And then it triggered reallocation\nof memblock.reserved.regions and memcpy the old array in kernel image\nmapping to the new array in linear mapping which caused a page fault.\n\n[    0.000000]
