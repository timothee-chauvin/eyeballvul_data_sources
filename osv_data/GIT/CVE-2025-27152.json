The issue occurs when passing absolute URLs rather than protocol-relative URLs to axios. Even if ⁠baseURL is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios. This issue is fixed in 1.8.2.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/axios/axios","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a9f7689b0c4b6d68c7f587c3aa376860da509d94"}]}],"versions":["0.19.1","0.21.3","1.2.0-alpha.1","1.2.2","v0.1.0","v0.10.0","v0.11.0","v0.11.1","v0.12.0","v0.13.0","v0.13.1","v0.14.0","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.2","v0.15.3","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.16.2","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.18.0","v0.19.0","v0.19.0-beta.1","v0.19.1","v0.19.2","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.20.0","v0.20.0-0","v0.21.0","v0.21.2","v0.23.0","v0.24.0","v0.25.0","v0.26.0","v0.26.1","v0.27.0","v0.27.1","v0.27.2","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.6.0","v0.7.0","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-alpha.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.6.8","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-beta.0","v1.7.0-beta.1","v1.7.0-beta.2","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.4","v1.7.5","v1.7.6","v1.7.7","v1.7.8","v1.7.9","v1.8.0","v1.8.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27152.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6463"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/axios/axios/security/advisories/GHSA-jr5f-v2jv-69x6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
