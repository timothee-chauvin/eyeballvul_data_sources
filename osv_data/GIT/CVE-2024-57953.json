On 32bit systems a long can hold numbers up to\napproximately two billion.  The number of TICKS_PER_HOUR is really large,\n(32768 * 3600) or roughly a hundred million.  When you start multiplying\nby a hundred million it doesn't take long to overflow the two billion\nmark.\n\nProbably the safest way to fix this is to change the type of\nTICKS_PER_HOUR to long long because it's such a large number.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9f67c1e63976d3403f0b250b03ffe959c890f9db"},{"fixed":"5127f3cbfc78a7b301b86328247230bec47e0bb3"},{"fixed":"53b0c7b15accb18d15d95c7fe68f61630ebfd1ca"},{"fixed":"09c4a610153286cef54d4f0c85398f4e32fc227e"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.13.1","v6.7","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-57953.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.13"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.13.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-57953.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/09c4a610153286cef54d4f0c85398f4e32fc227e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5127f3cbfc78a7b301b86328247230bec47e0bb3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/53b0c7b15accb18d15d95c7fe68f61630ebfd1ca"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/57xxx/CVE-2024-57953.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-57953"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/57xxx/CVE-2024-57953.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
