A bug in on-headers versions `<1.1.0` may result in response headers being inadvertently modified when an array is passed to `response.writeHead()`. Users should upgrade to version 1.1.0 to receive a patch. Uses are strongly encouraged to upgrade to `1.1.0`, but this issue can be worked around by passing an object to `response.writeHead()` rather than an array.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jshttp/on-headers","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c6e384908c9c6127d18831d16ab0bd96e1231867"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-7339.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://cna.openjsf.org/security-advisories.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/jshttp/on-headers/security/advisories/GHSA-76c9-3jph-rj3q"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jshttp/on-headers/commit/c6e384908c9c6127d18831d16ab0bd96e1231867"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/expressjs/morgan/issues/315"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/jshttp/on-headers/issues/15"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
