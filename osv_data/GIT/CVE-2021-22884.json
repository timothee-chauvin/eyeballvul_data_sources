When “localhost6” is not present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary domain that is resolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker controls the victim's DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection can be bypassed by using the “localhost6” domain. As long as the attacker uses the “localhost6” domain, they can still apply the attack described in CVE-2018-7160.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"fab0396eab86e8236899c69d3a56baad00e5af14"}]}],"versions":["vm-19.3.2","vm-19.3.2-pre","vm-19.3.3","vm-19.3.4","vm-20.0.1","vm-20.1.0","vm-20.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-22884.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nodejs/node","events":[{"introduced":"cf41627411886000429bde058a6594fb7f6d6d47"},{"fixed":"ce800870b4206bafea2942f0b404a7f8f86a8bea"}]}],"versions":["v10.0.0","v10.1.0","v10.10.0","v10.11.0","v10.12.0","v10.13.0","v10.14.0","v10.14.1","v10.14.2","v10.15.0","v10.15.1","v10.15.2","v10.15.3","v10.16.0","v10.16.1","v10.16.2","v10.16.3","v10.17.0","v10.18.0","v10.18.1","v10.19.0","v10.2.0","v10.2.1","v10.20.0","v10.20.1","v10.21.0","v10.22.0","v10.22.1","v10.23.0","v10.23.1","v10.23.2","v10.23.3","v10.3.0","v10.4.0","v10.4.1","v10.5.0","v10.6.0","v10.7.0","v10.8.0","v10.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-22884.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1069487"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2021-security-releases/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/#node-js-inspector-dns-rebinding-vulnerability-cve-2018-7160"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210416-0001/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210723-0001/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/E4FRS5ZVK4ZQ7XIJQNGIKUXG2DJFHLO7/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F45Y7TXSU33MTKB6AGL2Q5V5ZOCNPKOG/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HSYFUGKFUSZ27M5TEZ3FKILWTWFJTFAZ/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
