There is a vulnerability in SuiteCRM version 7.14.6 which allows unauthenticated downloads of any file from the upload-directory, as long as it is named by an ID (e.g. attachments). An unauthenticated attacker could download internal files when he discovers a valid file-ID.\nValid IDs could be brute-forced, but this is quite time-consuming as the file-IDs are usually UUIDs. This issue is fixed in version 7.14.7.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/suitecrm/suitecrm","events":[{"introduced":"e572230abd0dad205b24a96acce72590b20bf69d"},{"fixed":"55921fe6c5fd5e2f81fc401e2d9ac8653cfbb8b5"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"7.14.6"},{"fixed":"7.14.7"}]}}],"versions":["v7.14.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54787.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/salesagility/suitecrm-core","events":[{"introduced":"0820b6acc28a04b6386dc860f15ded621b8add27"},{"fixed":"3e06d0f16a8a7c2cf27062372e87a134d7a032c8"}]}],"versions":["v8.6.0","v8.6.1","v8.6.2","v8.7.0","v8.7.0-beta","v8.7.1","v8.8.0","v8.8.0-beta"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54787.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/SuiteCRM/SuiteCRM/security/advisories/GHSA-8r72-224q-g9fv"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.suitecrm.com/admin/releases/7.14.x/#_7_14_7"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-285"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
