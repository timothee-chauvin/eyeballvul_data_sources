However, the commit\ndid not handle the analogous situation for System Management Mode (SMM).\n\nThis omission results in triggering a WARN when KVM forces a vCPU INIT\nafter SHUTDOWN interception while the vCPU is in SMM. This situation was\nreprodused using Syzkaller by:\n\n  1) Creating a KVM VM and vCPU\n  2) Sending a KVM_SMI ioctl to explicitly enter SMM\n  3) Executing invalid instructions causing consecutive exceptions and\n     eventually a triple fault\n\nThe issue manifests as follows:\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 25506 at arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:12112\n  kvm_vcpu_reset+0x1d2/0x1530 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:12112\n  Modules linked in:\n  CPU: 0 PID: 25506 Comm: syz-executor.0 Not tainted\n  6.1.130-syzkaller-00157-g164fe5dde9b6 #0\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996),\n  BIOS 1.12.0-1 04/01/2014\n  RIP: 0010:kvm_vcpu_reset+0x1d2/0x1530 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:12112\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   shutdown_interception+0x66/0xb0 arch/x86/kvm/svm/svm.c:2136\n   svm_invoke_exit_handler+0x110/0x530 arch/x86/kvm/svm/svm.c:3395\n   svm_handle_exit+0x424/0x920 arch/x86/kvm/svm/svm.c:3457\n   vcpu_enter_guest arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:10959 [inline]\n   vcpu_run+0x2c43/0x5a90 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:11062\n   kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x50f/0x1cf0 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:11283\n   kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x570/0xf00 arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:4122\n   vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n   __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:870 [inline]\n   __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:856 [inline]\n   __x64_sys_ioctl+0x19a/0x210 fs/ioctl.c:856\n   do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:51 [inline]\n   do_syscall_64+0x35/0x80 arch/x86/entry/common.c:81\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0xd8\n\nArchitecturally, INIT is blocked when the CPU is in SMM, hence KVM's WARN()\nin kvm_vcpu_reset() to guard against KVM bugs, e.g. to detect improper\nemulation of INIT.  SHUTDOWN on SVM is a weird edge case where KVM needs to\ndo _something_ sane with the VMCB, since it's technically undefined, and\nINIT is the least awful choice given KVM's ABI.\n\nSo, double down on stuffing INIT on SHUTDOWN, and force the vCPU out of\nSMM to avoid any weirdness (and the WARN).\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.\n\n[sean: massage changelog,
