This vulnerability only affects sites which have modified or disabled Discourseâ€™s default Content Security Policy. This issue is patched in version 1.0.1 of the Discourse Calendar plugin. As a workaround, ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled, and has not been modified in a way which would make it more vulnerable to XSS attacks.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2719b9e81994e961bf8c4e12b4556dc9777dd62f"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31059.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/security/advisories/GHSA-c783-x9vm-xxp5"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/commit/2719b9e81994e961bf8c4e12b4556dc9777dd62f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/pull/280"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
