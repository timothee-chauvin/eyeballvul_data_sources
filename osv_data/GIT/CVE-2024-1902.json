{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-1902","published":"2024-04-10T17:15:53Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:37:27Z","details":"lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to a session reuse attack, allowing a removed user to change the organization name without proper authorization. The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation to check if a user is still part of an organization before allowing them to make changes. An attacker can exploit this by using an old authorization token to send a PATCH request, modifying the organization's name even after being removed from the organization. This issue is due to incorrect synchronization and affects the orgs.patch route.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d8e2e73efd53ab4e92cf47bbf4b639a9f08853d2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-1902.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/e536310e-abe7-4585-9cf6-21f77390a5e8"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/d8e2e73efd53ab4e92cf47bbf4b639a9f08853d2"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
