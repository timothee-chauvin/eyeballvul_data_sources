It calls\n`recvfrom()` with the default size for the buffer rather than with the size\nthat was used to allocate it. Thus, the content that might overwrite the heap\nmemory is entirely controlled by the server.\n\nThe flaw exists if the user selects to use a `blksize` of 504 or smaller\n(default is 512). The smaller size that is used, the larger the possible\noverflow becomes.\n\nUsers choosing a smaller size than default should be rare as the primary use\ncase for changing the size is to make it larger.\n\nIt is rare for users to use TFTP across the Internet. It is most commonly used\nwithin local networks.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"7.19.4"},{"fixed":"7.65.0"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git","events":[{"introduced":"0516ce7786e9500c2e447d48aa9b3f24a6ca70f9"},{"fixed":"2576003415625d7b5f0e390902f8097830b82275"}]}],"versions":["7.64.1","7.64.0","7.63.0","7.62.0","7.61.1","7.61.0","7.60.0","7.59.0","7.58.0","7.57.0","7.56.1","7.56.0","7.55.1","7.55.0","7.54.1","7.54.0","7.53.1","7.53.0","7.52.1","7.52.0","7.51.0","7.50.3","7.50.2","7.50.1","7.50.0","7.49.1","7.49.0","7.48.0","7.47.1","7.47.0","7.46.0","7.45.0","7.44.0","7.43.0","7.42.1","7.42.0","7.41.0","7.40.0","7.39.0","7.38.0","7.37.1","7.37.0","7.36.0","7.35.0","7.34.0","7.33.0","7.32.0","7.31.0","7.30.0","7.29.0","7.28.1","7.28.0","7.27.0","7.26.0","7.25.0","7.24.0","7.23.1","7.23.0","7.22.0","7.21.7","7.21.6","7.21.5","7.21.4","7.21.3","7.21.2","7.21.1","7.21.0","7.20.1","7.20.0","7.19.7","7.19.6","7.19.5","7.19.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://curl.se/docs/CURL-CVE-2019-5436.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"68387256152682745064219710432356406157","length":1476},"id":"CURL-CVE-2019-5436-5e7bc270","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git/commit/2576003415625d7b5f0e390902f8097830b82275","target":{"file":"lib/tftp.c","function":"tftp_connect"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["229143987650408811552229968059976373129","86149327857910721299193040869452586776","240915790023549134045664230468635773657","192072248737962367579359625305745306650"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CURL-CVE-2019-5436-a7dd1ef4","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git/commit/2576003415625d7b5f0e390902f8097830b82275","target":{"file":"lib/tftp.c"}}]}}],"database_specific":{"CWE":{"desc":"Heap-based Buffer Overflow","id":"CWE-122"},"URL":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2019-5436.json","affects":"both","award":{"amount":"200","currency":"USD"},"issue":"https://hackerone.com/reports/550696","last_affected":"7.64.1","package":"curl","severity":"Low","www":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2019-5436.html"},"credits":[{"name":"l00p3r","type":"FINDER"},{"name":"Daniel Stenberg","type":"REMEDIATION_DEVELOPER"}]}
