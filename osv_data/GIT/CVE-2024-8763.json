{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-8763","published":"2025-03-20T10:15:43Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:34:37Z","details":"A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7ff89b0304d191534b924cf063f3648206d497fa"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-8763.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/4fb63a6e-0056-4550-a34d-e161de1c13b8"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/7ff89b0304d191534b924cf063f3648206d497fa"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
