If suspend is triggered, firmware will be reloaded\nduring resume. As same as before, firmware requests two large segments at\nfirst. In ath12k_qmi_msg_mem_request_cb() segment count and size are\nassigned:\n\n\tab->qmi.mem_seg_count == 2\n\tab->qmi.target_mem[0].size == 7077888\n\tab->qmi.target_mem[1].size == 8454144\n\nThen allocation failed like before and ath12k_qmi_free_target_mem_chunk()\nis called to free all allocated segments. Note the first segment is skipped\nbecause its v.addr is cleared due to allocation failure:\n\n\tchunk->v.addr = dma_alloc_coherent()\n\nAlso note that this leaks that segment because it has not been freed.\n\nWhile freeing the second segment, a size of 8454144 is passed to\ndma_free_coherent(). However remember that this segment is allocated at\nthe first time firmware is loaded, before suspend. So its real size is\n524288, much smaller than 8454144. As a result kernel found we are freeing\nsome memory which is in use and thus cras\n---truncated---","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d889913205cf7ebda905b1e62c5867ed4e39f6c2"},{"fixed":"bb50a4e711ff95348ad53641acb1306d89eb4c3a"},{"fixed":"303c017821d88ebad887814114d4e5966d320b28"}]}],"versions":["v6.1","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7","v6.9.1","v6.9.2","v6.9.3","v6.9.4","v6.9.5","v6.9.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-40979.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.3.0"},{"fixed":"6.9.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-40979.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/303c017821d88ebad887814114d4e5966d320b28"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bb50a4e711ff95348ad53641acb1306d89eb4c3a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/40xxx/CVE-2024-40979.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40979"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/40xxx/CVE-2024-40979.json"}}
