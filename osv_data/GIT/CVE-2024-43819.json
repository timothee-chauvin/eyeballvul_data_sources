s390: Reject memory region operations for ucontrol VMs","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkvm: s390: Reject memory region operations for ucontrol VMs\n\nThis change rejects the KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION and\nKVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2 ioctls when called on a ucontrol VM.\nThis is necessary since ucontrol VMs have kvm->arch.gmap set to 0 and\nwould thus result in a null pointer dereference further in.\nMemory management needs to be performed in userspace and using the\nioctls KVM_S390_UCAS_MAP and KVM_S390_UCAS_UNMAP.\n\nAlso improve s390 specific documentation for KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION\nand KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2.\n\n[frankja@linux.ibm.com: commit message spelling fix, subject prefix
