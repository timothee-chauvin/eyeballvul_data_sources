In versions 0.0.6 through 0.7.7-rc1, an exposed testing endpoint allows reading arbitrary chats directly from the Meilisearch engine. The endpoint /api/search/test allows for direct access to stored chats in the Meilisearch engine without proper access control. This results in the ability to read chats from arbitrary users.
