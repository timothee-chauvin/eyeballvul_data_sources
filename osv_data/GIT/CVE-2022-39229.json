Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 allow one user to block another user's login attempt by registering someone else'e email address as a username. A Grafana user’s username and email address are unique fields, that means no other user can have the same username or email address as another user. A user can have an email address as a username. However, the login system allows users to log in with either username or email address. Since Grafana allows a user to log in with either their username or email address, this creates an usual behavior where `user_1` can register with one email address and `user_2` can register their username as `user_1`’s email address. This prevents `user_1` logging into the application since `user_1`'s password won’t match with `user_2`'s email address. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch. There are no workarounds for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana","events":[{"introduced":"b5c56f63710e09f37b8557ddd8b99ae3fc583169"},{"fixed":"3c0c14de5d73bed5cc429d2beeabd0217c6bf221"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"9.0.0"},{"fixed":"9.1.8"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana","events":[{"introduced":"6134e3cf35a99c7dd3041b7ececb47cb7619ba9a"},{"fixed":"5bc88988a5a25c23452249315e8789ef059a2a3d"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"8.5.0"},{"fixed":"8.5.14"}]}}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39229.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/39xxx/CVE-2022-39229.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/commit/5644758f0c5ae9955a4e5480d71f9bef57fdce35"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/releases/tag/v9.1.8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-gj7m-853r-289r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39229"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-287"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/39xxx/CVE-2022-39229.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
