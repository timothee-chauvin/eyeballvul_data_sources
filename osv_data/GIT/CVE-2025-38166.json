However, during rollback, msg->msg_iter is reset, but since\nmsg_pl->sg.size has been increased, subsequent executions will exceed the\nactual size of msg_iter.\n'''\niov_iter_revert(&msg->msg_iter, msg_pl->sg.size - orig_size);\n'''\n\nThe changes in this commit are based on the following considerations:\n\n1. When cork_bytes is set, rolling back to non-zero copy logic is\npointless and can directly go to zero-copy logic.\n\n2. We can not calculate the correct number of bytes to revert msg_iter.\n\nAssume the original data is \"abcdefgh\" (8 bytes), and after 3 pushes\nby the BPF program, it becomes 11-byte data: \"abc?de?fgh?\".\nThen, we set cork_bytes to 6, which means the first 6 bytes have been\nprocessed, and the remaining 5 bytes \"?fgh?\" will be cached until the\nlength meets the cork_bytes requirement.\n\nHowever, some data in \"?fgh?\" is not within 'sg->msg_iter'\n(but in msg_pl instead), especially the data \"?\" we pushed.\n\nSo it doesn't seem as simple as just reverting through an offset of\nmsg_iter.\n\n3. For non-TLS sockets in tcp_bpf_sendmsg, when a \"cork\" situation occurs,\nthe user-space send() doesn't return an error, and the returned length is\nthe same as the input length parameter, even if some data is cached.\n\nAdditionally, I saw that the current non-zero-copy logic for handling\ncorking is written as:\n'''\nline 1177\nelse if (ret != -EAGAIN) {\n\tif (ret == -ENOSPC)\n\t\tret = 0;\n\tgoto send_end;\n'''\n\nSo it's ok to just return 'copied' without error when a \"cork\" situation\noccurs.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d3b18ad31f93d0b6bae105c679018a1ba7daa9ca"},{"fixed":"328cac3f9f8ae394748485e769a527518a9137c8"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d3b18ad31f93d0b6bae105c679018a1ba7daa9ca"},{"fixed":"2e36a81d388ec9c3f78b6223f7eda2088cd40adb"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d3b18ad31f93d0b6bae105c679018a1ba7daa9ca"},{"fixed":"57fbbe29e86042bbaa31c1a30d2afa16c427e3f7"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d3b18ad31f93d0b6bae105c679018a1ba7daa9ca"},{"fixed":"603943f022a7fe5cc83ca7005faf34798fb7853f"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d3b18ad31f93d0b6bae105c679018a1ba7daa9ca"},{"fixed":"54a3ecaeeeae8176da8badbd7d72af1017032c39"}]}],"versions":["v4.19","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.1.96","v6.1.97","v6.1.98","v6.1.99","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-
