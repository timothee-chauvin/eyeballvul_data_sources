The\n   correct size is sizeof(u64).\n\n2) When it calculates the valid entry length kern_entrylen, it excludes one\n   entry by subtracting 1 from num_devices.\n\n3) It copies num_device by calling memcpy(). Substitution is enough.\n\n4) It does not specify the calculated length to sg_copy_from_buffer().\n   Instead, it specifies the payload length which is larger than the\n   alltgt_info size. It causes \"BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds\".\n\nFix the issues by using the correct header size, removing the subtraction\nfrom num_devices, replacing the memcpy() with substitution and specifying\nthe correct length to sg_copy_from_buffer().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"f5e6d5a343761081317c89d23489c93fbafc69ff"},{"fixed":"8ba997b22f2cd5d29aad8c39f6201f7608ed0c04"},{"fixed":"2f3d3fa5b8ed7d3b147478f42b00b468eeb1ecd2"},{"fixed":"fb428a2005fc1260d18b989cc5199f281617f44d"}]}],"versions":["v5.18","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.2","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.2.1","v6.2.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53320.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.19.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.16"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53320.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2f3d3fa5b8ed7d3b147478f42b00b468eeb1ecd2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8ba997b22f2cd5d29aad8c39f6201f7608ed0c04"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fb428a2005fc1260d18b989cc5199f281617f44d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53320.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53320"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53320.json"}}
