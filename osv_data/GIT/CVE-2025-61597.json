In versions 2.5.21 and below, an HTML template injection allows stored cross‑site scripting (XSS) via the mail template settings. Once a malicious payload is saved, any subsequent visit to the settings page in an authenticated admin context will execute attacker‑controlled JavaScript, enabling session/token theft and full admin account takeover. This issue is fixed in version 2.5.22.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/emlog/emlog","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9b220ff7c8b4ba84bde1e2b12193435101afa987"}]}],"versions":["5.3.1","6.0.0","6.1.0","ci","emlog_5.1.2","emlog_5.1.3","emlog_5.2.0","emlog_5.2.1","emlog_5.3.0","pro-1.0.1","pro-1.0.2","pro-1.0.3","pro-1.0.4","pro-1.0.5","pro-1.0.6","pro-1.0.7","pro-1.0.8","pro-1.1.0","pro-1.1.1","pro-1.2.0","pro-1.2.1","pro-1.2.2","pro-1.3.0","pro-1.3.1","pro-1.4.0","pro-1.5.0","pro-1.5.0.new","pro-1.5.1","pro-1.6.0","pro-1.7.0","pro-1.7.1","pro-1.8.0","pro-1.9.0","pro-1.9.1","pro-1.9.2","pro-1.9.3","pro-2.0.0","pro-2.0.1","pro-2.0.2","pro-2.0.3","pro-2.1.0","pro-2.1.1","pro-2.1.10","pro-2.1.11","pro-2.1.12","pro-2.1.13","pro-2.1.14","pro-2.1.15","pro-2.1.2","pro-2.1.3","pro-2.1.4","pro-2.1.5","pro-2.1.6","pro-2.1.7","pro-2.1.8","pro-2.1.9","pro-2.2.0","pro-2.2.1","pro-2.2.10","pro-2.2.11","pro-2.2.2","pro-2.2.3","pro-2.2.4","pro-2.2.5","pro-2.2.6","pro-2.2.7","pro-2.2.8","pro-2.2.9","pro-2.3.0","pro-2.3.1","pro-2.3.10","pro-2.3.11","pro-2.3.12","pro-2.3.13","pro-2.3.14","pro-2.3.15","pro-2.3.16","pro-2.3.17","pro-2.3.18","pro-2.3.2","pro-2.3.3","pro-2.3.4","pro-2.3.5","pro-2.3.6","pro-2.3.7","pro-2.3.8","pro-2.3.9","pro-2.4.0","pro-2.4.1","pro-2.4.2","pro-2.4.3","pro-2.5.1","pro-2.5.10","pro-2.5.11","pro-2.5.12","pro-2.5.13","pro-2.5.14","pro-2.5.15","pro-2.5.16","pro-2.5.17","pro-2.5.18","pro-2.5.19","pro-2.5.2","pro-2.5.20","pro-2.5.21","pro-2.5.3","pro-2.5.4","pro-2.5.5","pro-2.5.6","pro-2.5.7","pro-2.5.8","pro-2.5.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-61597.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/emlog/emlog/pull/179"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/emlog/emlog/security/advisories/GHSA-hj97-hp2c-6m4m"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
