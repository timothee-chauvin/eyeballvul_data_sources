This issue occurs while processing USB packets from a guest when USBDevice 'setup_len' exceeds its 'data_buf[4096]' in the do_token_in, do_token_out routines. This flaw allows a guest user to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service, or the potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/qemu/qemu","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"553032db17440f8de011390e5a1cfddd13751b0b"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.11.0-rc0","v0.12.0-rc0","v0.13.0-rc0","v0.14.0-rc0","v0.15.0-rc0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.5.0","v1.0","v1.0-rc0","v1.0-rc1","v1.0-rc2","v1.0-rc3","v1.0-rc4","v1.1-rc0","v1.1-rc1","v1.1-rc2","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-rc2","v1.1.0-rc3","v1.1.0-rc4","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-rc0","v1.2.0-rc1","v1.2.0-rc2","v1.2.0-rc3","v1.3.0","v1.3.0-rc0","v1.3.0-rc1","v1.3.0-rc2","v1.4.0","v1.4.0-rc0","v1.4.0-rc1","v1.4.0-rc2","v1.5.0","v1.5.0-rc0","v1.5.0-rc1","v1.5.0-rc2","v1.5.0-rc3","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-rc0","v1.6.0-rc1","v1.6.0-rc2","v1.6.0-rc3","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-rc0","v1.7.0-rc1","v1.7.0-rc2","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-rc0","v2.0.0-rc1","v2.0.0-rc2","v2.0.0-rc3","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-rc0","v2.1.0-rc1","v2.1.0-rc2","v2.1.0-rc3","v2.1.0-rc4","v2.1.0-rc5","v2.10.0","v2.10.0-rc0","v2.10.0-rc1","v2.10.0-rc2","v2.10.0-rc3","v2.10.0-rc4","v2.11.0","v2.11.0-rc0","v2.11.0-rc1","v2.11.0-rc2","v2.11.0-rc3","v2.11.0-rc4","v2.11.0-rc5","v2.12.0","v2.12.0-rc0","v2.12.0-rc1","v2.12.0-rc2","v2.12.0-rc3","v2.12.0-rc4","v2.2.0","v2.2.0-rc0","v2.2.0-rc1","v2.2.0-rc2","v2.2.0-rc3","v2.2.0-rc4","v2.2.0-rc5","v2.3.0","v2.3.0-rc0","v2.3.0-rc1","v2.3.0-rc2","v2.3.0-rc3","v2.3.0-rc4","v2.4.0","v2.4.0-rc0","v2.4.0-rc1","v2.4.0-rc2","v2.4.0-rc3","v2.4.0-rc4","v2.5.0","v2.5.0-rc0","v2.5.0-rc1","v2.5.0-rc2","v2.5.0-rc3","v2.5.0-rc4","v2.6.0","v2.6.0-rc0","v2.6.0-rc1","v2.6.0-rc2","v2.6.0-rc3","v2.6.0-rc4","v2.6.0-rc5","v2.7.0","v2.7.0-rc0","v2.7.0-rc1","v2.7.0-rc2","v2.7.0-rc3","v2.7.0-rc4","v2.7.0-rc5","v2.8.0","v2.8.0-rc0","v2.8.0-rc1","v2.8.0-rc2","v2.8.0-rc3","v2.8.0-rc4","v2.9.0","v2.9.0-rc0","v2.9.0-rc1","v2.9.0-rc2","v2.9.0-rc3","v2.9.0-rc4","v2.9.0-rc5","v3.0.0","v3.0.0-rc0","v3.0.0-rc1","v3.0.0-rc2","v3.0.0-rc3","v3.0.0-rc4","v3.1.0","v3.1.0-rc0","v3.1.0-rc1","v3.1.0-rc2","v3.1.0-rc3","v3.1.0-rc4","v3.1.0-rc5","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-rc0","v4.0.0-rc1","v4.0.0-rc2","v4.0.0-rc3","v4.0.0-rc4","v4.1.0","v4.1.0-rc0","v4.1.0-rc1","v4.1.0-rc2","v4.1.0-rc3","v4.1.0-rc4","v4.1.0-rc5","v4.2.0","v4.2.0-rc0","v4.2.0-rc1","v4.2.0-rc2","v4.2.0-rc3","v4.2.0-rc4","v4.2.0-rc5","v5.0.0","v5.0.0-rc0","v5.0.0-rc1","v5.0.0-rc2","v5.0.0-rc3","v5.0.0-rc4","v5.1.0","v5.1.0-rc0","v5.1.0-rc1","v5.1.0-rc2","v5.1.0-rc3","v5.2.0-rc0","v5.2.0-rc1","v5.2.0-rc2","v5.2.0-rc3","v5.2.0-rc4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-14364.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00024.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1869201"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/09/msg00013.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202009-14"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202011-09"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200924-0006/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4511-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4760"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/08/24/2"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/08/24/3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JTZQUQ6ZBPMFMNAUQBVJFELYNMUZLL6P/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M52WIRMZL6TZRYZ65N6OAYNNFHV62O2N/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
