All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects were subject to this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","events":[{"introduced":"716b0b1bd56eeab04e4441eecc91c2cd8bfda8b6"},{"last_affected":"042950dc23257bbc65cd2258f2fd2a197a98f802"},{"introduced":"e0407c58f79853e53e827e0eb52aaac2a39c6936"},{"last_affected":"1212b292c34804e3f14af2fbda5daaa85037a039"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2016-6814.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-announce/201701.mbox/%3CCADRx3PMZ2hBCGDTY35zYXFGaDnjAs0tc5-upaVs6QN2sYUejyA%40mail.gmail.com%3E"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0272.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2018-3678067.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2018-4258247.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95429"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039600"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0868"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2486"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2596"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-01"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
