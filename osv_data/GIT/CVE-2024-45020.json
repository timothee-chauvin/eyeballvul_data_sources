More specifically, it is the following code:\n\n    if (exact != NOT_EXACT &&\n        old->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] !=\n        cur->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE])\n            return false;\n\nThe 'i' iterates old->allocated_stack.\nIf cur->allocated_stack < old->allocated_stack the out-of-bound\naccess will happen.\n\nTo fix the issue add 'i >= cur->allocated_stack' check such that if\nthe condition is true, stacksafe() should fail. Otherwise,\ncur->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] memory access is legal.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ab470fefce2837e66b771c60858118d50bb5bb10"},{"fixed":"7cad3174cc79519bf5f6c4441780264416822c08"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"2793a8b015f7f1caadb9bce9c63dc659f7522676"},{"fixed":"6e3987ac310c74bb4dd6a2fa8e46702fe505fb2b"},{"fixed":"bed2eb964c70b780fb55925892a74f26cb590b25"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.10.1","v6.10.2","v6.10.3","v6.10.4","v6.10.5","v6.10.6","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.6","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45020.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.6.48"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.10.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-45020.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6e3987ac310c74bb4dd6a2fa8e46702fe505fb2b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7cad3174cc79519bf5f6c4441780264416822c08"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bed2eb964c70b780fb55925892a74f26cb590b25"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/45xxx/CVE-2024-45020.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45020"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/45xxx/CVE-2024-45020.json"}}
