Users that can create topics in TOC-enabled categories (and have sufficient trust level - configured in component's settings) are able to inject arbitrary HTML on that topic's page. The issue has been fixed on the `main` branch. Admins can update the theme component through the admin UI (Customize -> Themes -> Components -> DiscoTOC -> Check for Updates). Alternatively, admins can temporarily disable the DiscoTOC theme component.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/discourse/discotoc","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f80c215a283cd045d2a371403e6eba88b2911192"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39270.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/discourse/DiscoTOC/commit/f80c215a283cd045d2a371403e6eba88b2911192"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/discourse/DiscoTOC/security/advisories/GHSA-m44p-w923-w32h"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
