{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2020-24240","published":"2020-08-25T14:15:16Z","modified":"2025-10-21T05:47:11.100660Z","details":"GNU Bison before 3.7.1 has a use-after-free in _obstack_free in lib/obstack.c (called from gram_lex) when a '\\0' byte is encountered. NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and the observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug report was intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/akimd/bison","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"be95a4fe2951374676efc9454ffee8638faaf68d"}]}],"versions":["GNU_1_26","GNU_1_27","GNU_1_28","GNU_ORIG","after-merge-branch-1_29","before-m4-back-end","pre-merge-of-1-29-branch","v1.28b","v1.28c","v1.49a","v1.49b","v1.49c","v1.75","v1.875","v2.0","v2.1","v2.3a","v2.3b","v2.4","v2.4.1","v2.5","v2.5.1","v2.5.1_rc2","v2.5_rc1","v2.6","v2.6.1","v2.6.2","v2.6.3","v2.6.4","v2.6.5","v2.6.90","v2.7","v2.7.1","v2.7.90","v2.7.91","v3.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.1","v3.1.90","v3.1.91","v3.2","v3.2.1","v3.2.90","v3.2.91","v3.3","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.3.90","v3.3.91","v3.4","v3.4.1","v3.4.2","v3.4.90","v3.4.91","v3.4.92","v3.5","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.5.3","v3.5.4","v3.5.90","v3.5.91","v3.5.92","v3.5.93","v3.5.94","v3.6","v3.6.1","v3.6.2","v3.6.3","v3.6.4","v3.6.90","v3.6.91","v3.6.92","v3.6.93","v3.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-24240.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["152892177091449443900596977177214106375","110470093975942762776580447940415453127","8556976720912662219078527567889747895"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CVE-2020-24240-85d57cd5","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/akimd/bison/commit/be95a4fe2951374676efc9454ffee8638faaf68d","target":{"file":"src/flex-scanner.h"}}]}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/akimd/bison/commit/be95a4fe2951374676efc9454ffee8638faaf68d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/akimd/bison/compare/v3.7...v3.7.1"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-bison/2020-07/msg00051.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
