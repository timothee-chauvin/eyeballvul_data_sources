{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-26148","published":"2024-02-21T22:35:17Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:41:21.108904Z","aliases":["GHSA-fh6g-gvvp-587f"],"summary":"Querybook's Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability allows Privilege Elevation","details":"Querybook is a user interface for querying big data. Prior to version 3.31.1, there is a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor that enables users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript:` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution. The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL, thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pinterest/querybook","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bc620dabaaf13ff1dcb30af0b46a490403fb9908"}]}],"versions":["v2.3.0","v2.4.0","v3.14.2","v3.28.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-26148.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/security/advisories/GHSA-fh6g-gvvp-587f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/commit/bc620dabaaf13ff1dcb30af0b46a490403fb9908"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/pull/1412"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
