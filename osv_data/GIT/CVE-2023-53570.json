The\ninteger overflow can lead to a heap buffer overflow as num_elems determines\nthe size of the trailing array in elems, and this array is thereafter\nwritten to for each element in attrs.\n\nNote that this vulnerability only affects devices with the\nwiphy->mbssid_max_interfaces member set for the wireless physical device\nstruct in the device driver, and can only be triggered by a process with\nCAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities.\n\nFix this by checking for a maximum of 255 elements in attrs.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"dc1e3cb8da8b414b37208b2fb6755fef8122504b"},{"fixed":"e642eb67b8c10dcce758d549cc81564116e0fa49"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"dc1e3cb8da8b414b37208b2fb6755fef8122504b"},{"fixed":"7d09f9f255a5f78578deba5454923072bb53b16c"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"dc1e3cb8da8b414b37208b2fb6755fef8122504b"},{"fixed":"6311071a056272e1e761de8d0305e87cc566f734"}]}],"versions":["v5.15","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.4.1","v6.4.10","v6.4.2","v6.4.3","v6.4.4","v6.4.5","v6.4.6","v6.4.7","v6.4.8","v6.4.9","v6.5-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53570.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.46"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.11"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53570.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6311071a056272e1e761de8d0305e87cc566f734"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7d09f9f255a5f78578deba5454923072bb53b16c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e642eb67b8c10dcce758d549cc81564116e0fa49"}]}
