The vulnerability can be exploited if the one sends a specially prepared form of a serialized object to one of the deserialization endpoints of some Ignite components - discovery SPI, Ignite persistence, Memcached endpoint, socket steamer.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/ignite","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"8add7fd5b501b40658096cdde48af9e948aa8150"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-1295.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/45e7d5e2c6face85aab693f5ae0616563132ff757e5a558da80d0209%40%3Cdev.ignite.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103692"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2405"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
