This results in skipping some nodes or sockets\nwhen creating the tables and leaving some -1's for later code to trip.\nover, causing oopses.\n\nThe problem is that the socket<=>node lookups are created by doing a\nloop over all CPUs, then looking up the CPU's APICID and socket. But\nif a CPU is not present, there is no way to start this lookup.\n\nInstead of looping over all CPUs, take CPUs out of the equation\nentirely. Loop over all APICIDs which are mapped to a valid NUMA node.\nThen just extract the socket-id from the APICID.\n\nThis avoid tripping over disabled CPUs.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"8a50c58519271dd24ba760bb282875f6ad66ee71"},{"fixed":"0d01a0c3046d1545391ef7bb1f114743d00e3793"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"8a50c58519271dd24ba760bb282875f6ad66ee71"},{"fixed":"5290e88ba2c742ca77c5f5b690e5af549cfd8591"}]}],"versions":["v6.4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.5.1","v6.5.2","v6.5.3","v6.5.4","v6.6-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53496.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.5.0"},{"fixed":"6.5.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53496.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0d01a0c3046d1545391ef7bb1f114743d00e3793"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5290e88ba2c742ca77c5f5b690e5af549cfd8591"}]}
