{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-40318","published":"2023-05-03T12:16:27.800Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:08:09.215670Z","related":["ALSA-2023:6434"],"details":"An issue was discovered in bgpd in FRRouting (FRR) through 8.4. By crafting a BGP OPEN message with an option of type 0xff (Extended Length from RFC 9072), attackers may cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon restart, or out-of-bounds read). This is possible because of inconsistent boundary checks that do not account for reading 3 bytes (instead of 2) in this 0xff case. NOTE: this behavior occurs in bgp_open_option_parse in the bgp_open.c file, a different location (with a different attack vector) relative to CVE-2022-40302.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/frrouting/frr","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"087350d968e92f1f4f24ae0aae6de2722088fe79"}]}],"versions":["7.1_pulled","8.1-dev","base_7.2","base_7.3","base_7.4","base_7.5","base_7.6","base_8.0","base_8.1","base_8.2","base_8.3","frr-2.0","frr-2.0-rc1","frr-2.0-rc2","frr-3.0-branchpoint","frr-3.0-rc0","frr-3.0-rc1","frr-3.1-dev","frr-5.1-dev","frr-6.1-dev","frr-7.1-dev","frr-7.2-dev","frr-7.3-dev","frr-7.4-dev","frr-7.5-dev","frr-7.6-dev","frr-8.0-dev","frr-8.1-dev","frr-8.1-rc1","frr-8.2-dev","frr-8.3-dev","frr-8.4-dev","reindent-3.0-after","reindent-3.0-before","reindent-master-after","reindent-master-before"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-40318.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/releases"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00020.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5495"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
