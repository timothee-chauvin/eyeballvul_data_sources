{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-23820","published":"2024-01-26T16:37:27.065Z","modified":"2025-12-05T03:13:35.782169Z","aliases":["GHSA-rxpw-85vw-fx87","GO-2024-2477"],"summary":"OpenFGA DoS","details":"OpenFGA, an authorization/permission engine, is vulnerable to a denial of service attack in versions prior to 1.4.3. In some scenarios that depend on the model and tuples used, a call to `ListObjects` may not  release memory properly. So when a sufficiently high number of those calls are executed, the OpenFGA server can create an `out of memory` error and terminate. Version 1.4.3 contains a patch for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openfga/openfga","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"59527d9d5cf8561470ec88a30a9395c6ab2d4e57"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.2.5","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.10","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9","v1.4.0","v1.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-23820.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/23xxx/CVE-2024-23820.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/openfga/openfga/commit/908ac85c8b7769c8042cca31886df8db01976c39"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/tag/v1.4.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-rxpw-85vw-fx87"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23820"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/23xxx/CVE-2024-23820.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
