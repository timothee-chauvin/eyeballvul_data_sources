In code which applies _un-sanitized string values into metric names or labels_, an attacker could make use of this and send a `?lang` query parameter containing newlines, `}`  or similar characters which can lead to the attacker taking over the exported format -- including creating unbounded numbers of stored metrics, inflating server memory usage, or causing \"bogus\" metrics.
