Prior to version 1.47.1, if a schema includes the following characteristics: permission defined in terms of a union (+) and that union references the same relation on both sides (but one side arrows to a different permission). Then SpiceDB may have missing LookupResources results when checking the permission. This only affects LookupResources; other APIs calculate permissionship correctly. The issue is fixed in version 1.47.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b55a9f65aaacba19ec0b3eb004529a0d0bca4530"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.10.0","v1.11.0","v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.14.0","v1.14.1","v1.15.0","v1.16.0","v1.16.1","v1.16.2","v1.17.0","v1.18.1","v1.19.0","v1.2.0","v1.21.0","v1.21.0-rc1","v1.22.0","v1.22.0-rc1","v1.22.0-rc2","v1.22.0-rc4","v1.22.0-rc5","v1.22.0-rc6","v1.22.0-rc7","v1.22.0-rc8","v1.22.1","v1.22.1-rc1","v1.22.2","v1.23.0","v1.23.0-rc1","v1.23.0-rc2","v1.23.0-rc3","v1.23.0-rc4","v1.23.1","v1.23.1-rc1","v1.24.0","v1.24.0-rc1","v1.24.0-rc2","v1.24.0-rc3","v1.25.0","v1.25.0-rc1","v1.25.0-rc2","v1.25.0-rc3","v1.25.0-rc4","v1.26.0","v1.26.0-rc1","v1.26.0-rc2","v1.27.0","v1.27.0-rc1","v1.27.1-rc1","v1.28.0","v1.28.0-rc1","v1.29.0","v1.29.1","v1.29.1-rc1","v1.3.0","v1.30.0","v1.31.0","v1.32.0","v1.33.0","v1.34.0","v1.35.0","v1.35.1","v1.35.2","v1.35.3","v1.37.0","v1.38.0","v1.39.0","v1.4.0","v1.40.0","v1.40.1","v1.41.0","v1.42.0","v1.42.1","v1.43.0","v1.44.0","v1.44.3","v1.44.4","v1.45.0","v1.45.1","v1.45.2","v1.45.3","v1.45.4","v1.46.0","v1.46.1","v1.46.2","v1.47.0","v1.5.0","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.8.0","v1.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65111.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/65xxx/CVE-2025-65111.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/8c2edbe1e7bd3851fa2138f4cc344bfde986dcf2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-9m7r-g8hg-x3vr"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65111"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-277"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/65xxx/CVE-2025-65111.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
