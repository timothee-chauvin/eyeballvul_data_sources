Missing free space info items, sometimes caught with a \"missing free\n   space info for X\" error.\n3. Double-accounted space: ranges that were allocated in the extent tree\n   and also marked as free in the free space tree, ranges that were\n   marked as allocated twice in the extent tree, or ranges that were\n   marked as free twice in the free space tree. If the latter made it\n   onto disk, the next reboot would hit the BUG_ON() in\n   add_new_free_space().\n4. On some hosts with no on-disk corruption or error messages, the\n   in-memory space cache (dumped with drgn) disagreed with the free\n   space tree.\n\nAll of these symptoms have the same underlying cause: a race between\ncaching the free space for a block group and returning free space to the\nin-memory space cache for pinned extents causes us to double-add a free\nrange to the space cache. This race exists when free space is cached\nfrom the free space tree (space_cache=v2) or the extent tree\n(nospace_cache, or space_cache=v1 if the cache needs to be regenerated).\nstruct btrfs_block_group::last_byte_to_unpin and struct\nbtrfs_block_group::progress are supposed to protect against this race,\nbut commit d0c2f4fa555e (\"btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when\nwaiting for a transaction commit\") subtly broke this by allowing\nmultiple transactions to be unpinning extents at the same time.\n\nSpecifically, the race is as follows:\n\n1. An extent is deleted from an uncached block group in transaction A.\n2. btrfs_commit_transaction() is called for transaction A.\n3. btrfs_run_delayed_refs() -> __btrfs_free_extent() runs the delayed\n   ref for the deleted extent.\n4. __btrfs_free_extent() -> do_free_extent_accounting() ->\n   add_to_free_space_tree() adds the deleted extent back to the free\n   space tree.\n5. do_free_extent_accounting() -> btrfs_update_block_group() ->\n   btrfs_cache_block_group() queues up the block group to get cached.\n   block_group->progress is set to block_group->start.\n6. btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction A calls\n   switch_commit_roots(). It sets block_group->last_byte_to_unpin to\n   block_group->progress, which is block_group->start because the block\n   group hasn't been cached yet.\n7. The caching thread gets to our block group. Since the commit roots\n   were already switched, load_free_space_tree() sees the deleted extent\n   as free and adds it to the space cache. It finishes caching and sets\n   block_group->progress to U64_MAX.\n8. btrfs_commit_transaction() advances transaction A to\n   TRANS_STATE_SUPER_COMMITTED.\n9. fsync calls btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction B. Since\n   transaction A is already in TRANS_STATE_SUPER_COMMITTED and the\n   commit is for fsync, it advances.\n10. btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction B calls\n    switch_commit_roots(). This time, the block group has already been\n    cached, so it sets block_group->last_byte_to_unpin to U64_MAX.\n11. btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction A calls\n    btrfs_finish_extent_commit(), which calls unpin_extent_range() for\n    the deleted extent. It sees last_byte_to_unpin set to U64_MAX (by\n    transaction B!), so it adds the deleted extent to the space cache\n    again!\n\nThis explains all of our symptoms above:\n\n* If the sequence of events is exactly as described above, when the free\n  space is re-added in step 11, it will fail with EEXIST.\n* If another thread reallocates the deleted extent in between steps 7\n  and 11, then step 11 will silently re-add that space to the space\n  cache as free even though it is actually allocated. Then, if that\n  space is allocated *again*, the free space tree will be corrupted\n  (namely, the wrong item will be deleted).\n* If we don't catch this free space tree corr\n---truncated---","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d0c2f4fa555e70324ec2a129b822ab58f172cc62"},{"fixed":"92dc4c1a8e58bcc7a183a4c86b055c24cc88d967"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d0c2f4fa555e70324ec2a129b822ab58f172cc62"},{"fixed":"a2e54eb64229f07f917b05d0c323604fda9b89f7"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d0c2f4fa555e70324ec2a129b822ab58f172cc62"},{"fixed":"ced8ecf026fd8084cf175530ff85c76d6085d715"}]}],"versions":["v5.11","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.7","v5.15.8","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.19.1","v5.19.2","v5.19.3","v5.19.4","v5.19.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49999.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.12.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.65"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.19.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49999.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/92dc4c1a8e58bcc7a183a4c86b055c24cc88d967"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a2e54eb64229f07f917b05d0c323604fda9b89f7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ced8ecf026fd8084cf175530ff85c76d6085d715"}]}
