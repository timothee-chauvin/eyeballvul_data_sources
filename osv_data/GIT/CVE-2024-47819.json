This can be leveraged to gain access to higher-privilege endpoints, e.g. if you get a user with admin privileges to run the code, you can potentially elevate all users and grant them admin privileges or access protected content. Versions 14.3.1 and 15.0.0 contain a patch. As a workaround, ensure that access to the Dictionary section is only granted to trusted users.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/umbraco/umbraco-cms","events":[{"introduced":"8685c7d64a1c597983cfb82e1bd1d269d22e4508"},{"fixed":"6caf53ed2e62762ae07f2b8a73403f30594b42fa"}]}],"versions":["13.5.0-rc","release-10.8.6","release-12.3.10","release-13.3.0","release-13.3.1","release-13.3.2","release-13.4.0","release-13.4.0-rc","release-13.4.0-rc2","release-13.4.1","release-13.5.0","release-14.0.0","release-14.1.0","release-14.1.0-rc","release-14.1.0-rc2","release-14.1.1","release-14.1.2","release-14.2.0","release-14.2.0-rc","release-14.2.0-rc2","release-14.3.0","release-14.3.0-rc"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-47819.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/47xxx/CVE-2024-47819.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-c5g6-6xf7-qxp3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47819"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/47xxx/CVE-2024-47819.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
