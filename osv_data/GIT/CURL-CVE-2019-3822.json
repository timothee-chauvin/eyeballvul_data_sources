The check that\nexists to prevent the local buffer from getting overflowed is implemented\nwrongly (using unsigned math) and as such it does not prevent the overflow\nfrom happening.\n\nThis output data can grow larger than the local buffer if very large response\ndata is extracted from a previous NTLMv2 header provided by the malicious or\nbroken HTTP server.\n\nSuch large response data needs to be around 1000 bytes or more. The actual\npayload data copied to the target buffer comes from the NTLMv2 type-2 response\nheader.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"7.36.0"},{"fixed":"7.64.0"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git","events":[{"introduced":"86724581b6c02d160b52f817550cfdfc9c93af62"},{"fixed":"50c9484278c63b958655a717844f0721263939cc"}]}],"versions":["7.63.0","7.62.0","7.61.1","7.61.0","7.60.0","7.59.0","7.58.0","7.57.0","7.56.1","7.56.0","7.55.1","7.55.0","7.54.1","7.54.0","7.53.1","7.53.0","7.52.1","7.52.0","7.51.0","7.50.3","7.50.2","7.50.1","7.50.0","7.49.1","7.49.0","7.48.0","7.47.1","7.47.0","7.46.0","7.45.0","7.44.0","7.43.0","7.42.1","7.42.0","7.41.0","7.40.0","7.39.0","7.38.0","7.37.1","7.37.0","7.36.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://curl.se/docs/CURL-CVE-2019-3822.json","vanir_signatures":[{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"line_hashes":["46522549148290454789925570788080158728","49236166746968004033894625933615643172","293989637352139989590772450278867974609","337876479484979625219132730045572941827","28263089313798147067029949814912665161","73333534050834162111357397437957432721","272835995896107667374360360978373141065","172736422550849646938343555519740730524"],"threshold":0.9},"id":"CURL-CVE-2019-3822-0fb0f4e0","signature_type":"Line","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git/commit/50c9484278c63b958655a717844f0721263939cc","target":{"file":"lib/vauth/ntlm.c"}},{"deprecated":false,"digest":{"function_hash":"281456879565379301859239210676266882046","length":5186},"id":"CURL-CVE-2019-3822-4f5c57d6","signature_type":"Function","signature_version":"v1","source":"https://github.com/curl/curl.git/commit/50c9484278c63b958655a717844f0721263939cc","target":{"file":"lib/vauth/ntlm.c","function":"Curl_auth_create_ntlm_type3_message"}}]}}],"database_specific":{"CWE":{"desc":"Stack-based Buffer Overflow","id":"CWE-121"},"URL":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2019-3822.json","affects":"both","last_affected":"7.63.0","package":"curl","severity":"High","www":"https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2019-3822.html"},"credits":[{"name":"Wenxiang Qian of Tencent Blade Team","type":"FINDER"},{"name":"Daniel Stenberg","type":"REMEDIATION_DEVELOPER"},{"name":"Huzaifa Sidhpurwala","type":"OTHER"}]}
