{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-31170","published":"2022-07-21T14:00:18Z","modified":"2025-12-04T10:24:52.568027Z","aliases":["GHSA-qh9x-gcfh-pcrw"],"summary":" OpenZeppelin Contracts's ERC165Checker may revert instead of returning false","details":"OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Versions 4.0.0 until 4.7.1 are vulnerable to ERC165Checker reverting instead of returning `false`. `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is designed to always successfully return a boolean, and under no circumstance revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-165 as expected, specifically if it returns a value other than 0 or 1. The contracts that may be affected are those that use `ERC165Checker` to check for support for an interface and then handle the lack of support in a way other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts","events":[{"introduced":"a673994de5eba4305cefb8ae98ea9ad37a43efaa"},{"fixed":"3b8b4ba82c880c31cd3b96dd5e15741d7e26658e"}]}],"versions":["v4.0.0","v4.1.0","v4.1.0-rc.0","v4.2.0","v4.2.0-rc.0","v4.3.0","v4.3.0-rc.0","v4.3.1","v4.3.2","v4.4.0","v4.4.0-rc.0","v4.4.0-rc.1","v4.4.1","v4.7.0","v4.7.0-rc.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31170.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/31xxx/CVE-2022-31170.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3552"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-qh9x-gcfh-pcrw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31170"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-20"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/31xxx/CVE-2022-31170.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
