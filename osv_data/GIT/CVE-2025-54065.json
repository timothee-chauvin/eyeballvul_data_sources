GZDoom is an open source Doom engine. In versions 4.14.2 and earlier, ZScript actor state handling allows scripts to read arbitrary addresses, write constants into the JIT-compiled code section, and redirect control flow through crafted FState and VMFunction structures. A script can copy FState structures into a writable buffer, modify function pointers and state transitions, and cause execution of attacker-controlled bytecode, leading to arbitrary code execution.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zdoom/gzdoom","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"99aa489d09015a95bb78df2b30ede29f328cc874"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"4.14.2"}]}}],"versions":["2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.1.7","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.5.0","2.5pre","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.8.9999","2.8pre","2.9pre","G1.9pre","ci_deps","g2.0.01pre","g2.1.pre","g2.1pre","g2.2pre","g2.3pre","g2.4pre","g3.0pre","g3.2pre","g3.3pre","g3.4pre","g3.5pre","g3.6pre","g3.7pre","g3.8pre","g4.10pre","g4.11pre","g4.12pre","g4.13pre","g4.14.1","g4.14.2","g4.14pre","g4.15pre","g4.1pre","g4.2pre","g4.3pre","g4.4pre","g4.5pre","g4.6pre","g4.7.0pre","g4.8pre","g4.9pre","notok#2","ok3","test_1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54065.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/security/advisories/GHSA-prhc-chfw-32jg"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-913"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
