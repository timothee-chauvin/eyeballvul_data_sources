f2fs_truncate_hole().\n\nThe root cause is: a non-inode dnode may has the same footer.ino and\nfooter.nid, so the dnode will be parsed as an inode, then ADDRS_PER_PAGE()\nmay return wrong blkaddr count which may be 923 typically, by chance,\ndn.ofs_in_node is equal to 923, then count can be calculated to 0 in below\nstatement, later it will trigger panic w/ f2fs_bug_on(, count == 0 || ...).\n\n\tcount = min(end_offset - dn.ofs_in_node, pg_end - pg_start);\n\nThis patch introduces a new node_type NODE_TYPE_NON_INODE, then allowing\npassing the new_type to sanity_check_node_footer in f2fs_get_node_folio()\nto detect corruption that a non-inode dnode has the same footer.ino and\nfooter.nid.\n\nScripts to reproduce:\nmkfs.f2fs -f /dev/vdb\nmount /dev/vdb /mnt/f2fs\ntouch
