The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted zip file that leads to an infinite loop. This issue also impacts the zipfile module of CPython, as features from the third-party zipp library are later merged into CPython, and the affected code is identical in both projects. The infinite loop can be initiated through the use of functions affecting the `Path` module in both zipp and zipfile, such as `joinpath`, the overloaded division operator, and `iterdir`. Although the infinite loop is not resource exhaustive, it prevents the application from responding. The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.19.1 of jaraco/zipp.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/jaraco/zipp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"fd604bd34f0343472521a36da1fbd22e793e14fd"}]}],"versions":["0.3.3","v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.6.0","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.1.0","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v3.0.0","v3.1.0","v3.10.0","v3.11.0","v3.12.0","v3.12.1","v3.13.0","v3.14.0","v3.15.0","v3.16.0","v3.16.1","v3.16.2","v3.17.0","v3.18.0","v3.18.1","v3.18.2","v3.19.0","v3.2.0","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.3.2","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.4.2","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.6.0","v3.7.0","v3.8.0","v3.8.1","v3.9.0","v3.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-5569.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/be898306-11f9-46b4-b28c-f4c4aa4ffbae"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/jaraco/zipp/commit/fd604bd34f0343472521a36da1fbd22e793e14fd"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
