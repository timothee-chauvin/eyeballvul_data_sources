As highlighted by the\ncxl-create-region.sh test [1], a single device may host multiple\nregions, but the driver was only tracking one region at a time. This\nleads to a situation where only the last enabled region per nvdimm\ndevice is cleaned up properly. Other regions are leaked, and this also\ncauses cxl_memdev reference leaks.\n\nFix the tracking by allowing cxl_nvdimm objects to track multiple region\nassociations.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"04ad63f086d1a9649b8b082748cbc7a570ade461"},{"fixed":"f43b6bfdbab78606735ba81185cf0602b81e40b6"},{"fixed":"4d07ae22e79ebc2d7528bbc69daa53b86981cb3a"}]}],"versions":["v5.19","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.0.6","v6.0.7","v6.1-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49896.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49896.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4d07ae22e79ebc2d7528bbc69daa53b86981cb3a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f43b6bfdbab78606735ba81185cf0602b81e40b6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49896.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49896"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49896.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
