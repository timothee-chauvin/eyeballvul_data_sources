An SError may also become pending,\nand will be synchronised by KVM. KVM notes the exception type, and whether\nan SError was synchronised in exit_code.\n\nWhen an exception other than an IRQ occurs, fixup_guest_exit() updates\nvcpu->arch.fault.esr_el2 from the hardware register. When an SError was\nsynchronised, the vcpu esr value is used to determine if the exception\nwas due to an HVC. If so, ELR_EL2 is moved back one instruction. This\nis so that KVM can process the SError first, and re-execute the HVC if\nthe guest survives the SError.\n\nBut if an IRQ synchronises an SError, the vcpu's esr value is stale.\nIf the previous non-IRQ exception was an HVC, KVM will corrupt ELR_EL2,\ncausing an unrelated guest instruction to be executed twice.\n\nCheck ARM_EXCEPTION_CODE() before messing with ELR_EL2, IRQs don't\nupdate this register so don't need to check.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"defe21f49bc98b095300752aa1e19bb608f3e97d"},{"fixed":"e1e852746997500f1873f60b954da5f02cc2dba3"},{"fixed":"57e2986c3b25092691a6e3d6ee9168caf8978932"},{"fixed":"1c71dbc8a179d99dd9bb7e7fc1888db613cf85de"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.3","v5.15.4","v5.15.5","v5.15.6","v5.15.7","v5.15.8","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.16.1","v5.16.2","v5.16.3","v5.16.4","v5.16.5","v5.16.6","v5.16.7","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-48727.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.11.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.22"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.16.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-48727.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1c71dbc8a179d99dd9bb7e7fc1888db613cf85de"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/57e2986c3b25092691a6e3d6ee9168caf8978932"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e1e852746997500f1873f60b954da5f02cc2dba3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/48xxx/CVE-2022-48727.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48727"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/48xxx/CVE-2022-48727.json"}}
