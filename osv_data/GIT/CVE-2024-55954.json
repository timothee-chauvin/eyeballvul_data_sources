{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-55954","published":"2025-01-16T19:30:39Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:45:35.414853Z","aliases":["GHSA-m8gj-6r85-3r6m"],"summary":"OpenObserve Improper Authorization Allows Admin User to Remove Root User","details":"OpenObserve is a cloud-native observability platform. A vulnerability in the user management endpoint `/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` allows an \"Admin\" role user to remove a \"Root\" user from the organization. This violates the intended privilege hierarchy, enabling a non-root user to remove the highest-privileged account. Due to insufficient role checks, the `remove_user_from_org` function does not prevent an \"Admin\" user from removing a \"Root\" user. As a result, an attacker with an \"Admin\" role can remove critical \"Root\" users, potentially gaining effective full control by eliminating the highest-privileged accounts. The `DELETE /api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` endpoint is affected. This issue has been addressed in release version `0.14.1` and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"adc52c1ed1c2147b891b3a9a40943dd7992565bb"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.7","v0.1.8","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.10.2-rc1","v0.10.3","v0.10.4","v0.10.5","v0.10.6","v0.10.6-rc1","v0.10.7","v0.10.7-rc1","v0.10.7-rc2","v0.10.7-rc3","v0.10.8","v0.10.8-rc1","v0.10.8-rc2","v0.10.8-rc3","v0.10.8-rc4","v0.10.8-rc5","v0.10.9","v0.10.9-rc1","v0.10.9-rc2","v0.10.9-rc3","v0.10.9-rc4","v0.11.0","v0.11.0-rc1","v0.11.0-rc2","v0.11.0-rc3","v0.12.0","v0.12.0-rc1","v0.12.0-rc2","v0.12.1","v0.13.0","v0.13.0-rc1","v0.13.0-rc2","v0.13.1","v0.13.1-rc1","v0.13.1-rc2","v0.13.1-rc3","v0.13.2-rc1","v0.13.2-rc2","v0.13.2-rc3","v0.13.2-rc4","v0.14.0","v0.14.1-rc1","v0.14.1-rc2","v0.14.1-rc3","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.4.8","v0.4.9","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.7.0","v0.7.0-rc1","v0.7.0-rc2","v0.7.2","v0.7.2-rc1","v0.8.0","v0.8.0-rc1","v0.8.0-rc2","v0.8.1","v0.8.1-rc1","v0.8.1-rc2","v0.8.2-rc1","v0.8.2-rc2","v0.8.2-rc3","v0.8.2-rc4","v0.8.2-rc5","v0.8.2-rc6","v0.8.2-rc7","v0.9.0-rc1","v0.9.0-rc2","v0.9.0-rc3","v0.9.0-rc4","v0.9.0-rc5","v0.9.0-rc6","v0.9.0-rc7","v0.9.0-rc8","v0.9.1","v0.9.2-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-55954.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve/security/advisories/GHSA-m8gj-6r85-3r6m"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/gaby/openobserve/blob/main/src/service/users.rs#L631"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-269","CWE-272","CWE-284","CWE-285","CWE-287"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
