By default, the jinja2 templating language is now marked as 'unsafe' and is not evaluated.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ansible/ansible","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ed56f51f185a1ffd7ea57130d260098686fcc7c2"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2","0.01","0.3","0.7","v1.0","v1.1","v1.2","v1.4.0","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1_last","v2.0.0-0.1.alpha1","v2.0.0-0.2.alpha2","v2.0.0-0.3.beta1","v2.0.0-0.4.beta2","v2.0.0-0.5.beta3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-7481.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98492"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1244"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1334"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1476"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1499"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1599"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2524"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-7481"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/ed56f51f185a1ffd7ea57130d260098686fcc7c2"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/01/msg00023.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4072-1/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
