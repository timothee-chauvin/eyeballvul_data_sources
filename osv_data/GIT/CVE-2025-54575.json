{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-54575","published":"2025-07-30T19:55:16Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:47:57.998512Z","aliases":["GHSA-rxmq-m78w-7wmc"],"summary":"ImageSharp Triggers an Infinite Loop in its GIF Decoder When Skipping Malformed Comment Extension Blocks","details":"ImageSharp is a 2D graphics library. In versions below 2.1.11 and 3.0.0 through 3.1.10, a specially crafted GIF file containing a malformed comment extension block (with a missing block terminator) can cause the ImageSharp GIF decoder to enter an infinite loop while attempting to skip the block. This leads to a denial of service. Applications processing untrusted GIF input should upgrade to a patched version. This issue is fixed in versions 2.1.11 and 3.1.11.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sixlabors/imagesharp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"cb115c2293b63155ce29ee1e168024add20bcf28"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sixlabors/imagesharp","events":[{"introduced":"6ec1692ee295923d9d40956befd4417d6735507b"},{"fixed":"f4a2684737732059876c13c481c856ed6b28e2c6"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.3","v2.0.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.10","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.1.6","v2.1.7","v2.1.8","v2.1.9","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.10","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.1.4","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.1.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54575.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-rxmq-m78w-7wmc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/commit/55e49262df9a057dff9b7807ed1b7bdb49187c3f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/commit/833f3ceec35af6b775950e06f03b934546cefbf6"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/2953"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400","CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
