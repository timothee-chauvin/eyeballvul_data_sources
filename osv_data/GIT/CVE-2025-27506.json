The API endpoint related to the password reset function is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting. The endpoint /api/v1/db/auth/password/reset/:tokenId is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting. The flaw occurs due to implementation of the client-side template engine ejs, specifically on file resetPassword.ts where the template is using the insecure function “<%-“, which is rendered by the function renderPasswordReset. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.258.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0f115e7f7f181bbe0fc3a33e053710e96ee16765"}]}],"versions":["0.10.0","0.10.1","0.10.2","0.10.3","0.10.4","0.10.5","0.10.6","0.100.0","0.100.1","0.100.2","0.101.0","0.101.0-beta.0","0.101.2","0.104.1","0.104.2","0.104.3","0.105.0","0.105.1","0.105.2","0.105.3","0.106.0","0.106.0-beta.0","0.106.0-beta.1","0.106.1","0.107.0","0.107.0-beta.0","0.107.0-beta.1","0.107.1","0.107.2","0.107.3","0.107.4","0.107.5","0.108.0","0.108.0-beta.0","0.108.1","0.109.0","0.109.1","0.109.2","0.109.3","0.109.4","0.109.5","0.109.6","0.109.7","0.11.0","0.11.1","0.11.10","0.11.11","0.11.12","0.11.14","0.11.15","0.11.16","0.11.17","0.11.18","0.11.19","0.11.20","0.11.21","0.11.22","0.11.23","0.11.24","0.11.25","0.11.26","0.11.28","0.11.29","0.11.3","0.11.30","0.11.31","0.11.32","0.11.33","0.11.34","0.11.36","0.11.39","0.11.4","0.11.40","0.11.41","0.11.42","0.11.43","0.11.44","0.11.45","0.11.46","0.11.5","0.11.6","0.11.7","0.11.9","0.111.0","0.111.1","0.111.2","0.111.3","0.111.4","0.200.0","0.202.0","0.202.10","0.202.4","0.202.5","0.202.6","0.202.7","0.202.8","0.202.9","0.203.0","0.203.1","0.203.2","0.204.0","0.204.1","0.204.2","0.204.3","0.204.4","0.204.5","0.204.6","0.204.7","0.204.8","0.204.9","0.205.0","0.205.1","0.207.0","0.207.1","0.207.2","0.207.3","0.250.0","0.250.1","0.250.2","0.251.0","0.251.1","0.251.2","0.251.3","0.252.0","0.253.0","0.255.0","0.255.1","0.255.2","0.256.0","0.257.0","0.257.2","0.4.5","0.4.8","0.4.9","0.80.0","0.81.0","0.81.1","0.82.0","0.83.0","0.83.1","0.83.2","0.83.3","0.83.4","0.83.5","0.83.6","0.83.8","0.84.1","0.84.10","0.84.12","0.84.13","0.84.14","0.84.15","0.84.16","0.84.2","0.84.3","0.84.6","0.84.7","0.84.8","0.84.9","0.9","0.90.0","0.90.1","0.90.10","0.90.11","0.90.2","0.90.3","0.90.4","0.90.5","0.90.7","0.90.8","0.90.9","0.91.0","0.91.1","0.91.10","0.91.6","0.91.7","0.91.8","0.91.9","0.92.0","0.92.1","0.92.2","0.92.3","0.92.4","0.96.0","0.96.1","0.96.2","0.96.4","0.97.0","0.98.1","0.98.2","0.98.3","0.98.4","0.99.0","0.99.1","0.99.2","v0.10.0","v0.4.2","v0.4.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27506.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/blob/ba5a191b33259d984fc92df225f7d82ede2ddb56/packages/nocodb/src/modules/auth/auth.controller.ts#L251"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/blob/ba5a191b33259d984fc92df225f7d82ede2ddb56/packages/nocodb/src/modules/auth/ui/auth/resetPassword.ts#L71"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/commit/ea821edb133e621e26183ae65c8ff9ee5d6f2723"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/security/advisories/GHSA-wf6c-hrhf-86cw"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
