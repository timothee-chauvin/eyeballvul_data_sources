In versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.0, refresh shares with smaller min_signers will reduce security of group. The inability to change min_signers (i.e. the threshold) with the refresh share functionality (frost_core::keys::refresh module) was not made clear to users. Using a smaller value would not decrease the threshold, and attempts to sign using a smaller threshold would fail. Additionally, after refreshing the shares with a smaller threshold, it would still be possible to sign with the original threshold, potentially causing a security loss to the participant's shares. This issue is fixed in version 2.2.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zcashfoundation/frost","events":[{"introduced":"2d88edf1623ee29f671a43966aae0bd4ead2ea7a"},{"fixed":"3ffc19d8f473d5bc4e07ed41bc884bdb42d6c29f"}]}],"versions":["frost-core/v2.0.0","frost-core/v2.1.0","frost-ed25519/v2.0.0","frost-ed25519/v2.1.0","frost-ed448/v2.0.0","frost-ed448/v2.1.0","frost-p256/v2.0.0","frost-p256/v2.1.0","frost-rerandomized/v2.0.0","frost-rerandomized/v2.1.0","frost-ristretto255/v2.0.0","frost-ristretto255/v2.1.0","frost-secp256k1-tr/v2.1.0","frost-secp256k1/v2.0.0","frost-secp256k1/v2.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-58359.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/commit/379ef689c733b3d9c80fd409071d4f3af4dafed2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/releases/tag/frost-core%2Fv2.2.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/security/advisories/GHSA-wgq8-vr6r-mqxm"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-325"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
