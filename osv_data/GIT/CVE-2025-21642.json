Linked\nto that, the per-netns data should always be obtained from the table\nlinked to the netns it had been created for, which may not coincide with\nthe reader's or writer's netns.\n\nAnother reason is that access to current->nsproxy->netns can oops if\nattempted when current->nsproxy had been dropped when the current task\nis exiting. This is what syzbot found, when using acct(2):\n\n  Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000005: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI\n  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in
