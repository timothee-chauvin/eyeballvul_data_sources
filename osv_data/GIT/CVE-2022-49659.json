RX-offload is designed to handle overflows of the timestamp\ncorrectly, if 32 bit timestamps are provided.\n\nThe timestamps of m_can core are only 16 bits wide. So this patch\nshifts them to full 32 bit before passing them to RX-offload.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"1be37d3b0414e3db47f6fcba6c16286bbae0cb65"},{"fixed":"c7333f79888497bfd75dcd02a94eaf836dd1042c"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"1be37d3b0414e3db47f6fcba6c16286bbae0cb65"},{"fixed":"2a2914a5bd7f38efe55a8372178146de82e0bce9"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"1be37d3b0414e3db47f6fcba6c16286bbae0cb65"},{"fixed":"4c3333693f07313f5f0145a922f14a7d3c0f4f21"}]}],"versions":["v5.12","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.6","v5.15.7","v5.15.8","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.18.1","v5.18.10","v5.18.2","v5.18.3","v5.18.4","v5.18.5","v5.18.6","v5.18.7","v5.18.8","v5.18.9","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49659.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.13.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.54"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.18.11"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49659.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2a2914a5bd7f38efe55a8372178146de82e0bce9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4c3333693f07313f5f0145a922f14a7d3c0f4f21"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c7333f79888497bfd75dcd02a94eaf836dd1042c"}]}
