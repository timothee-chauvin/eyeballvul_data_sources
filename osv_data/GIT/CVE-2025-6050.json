The vulnerability exists in the \"displayable_links_js\" function, which fails to properly sanitize blog post titles before including them in JSON responses served via \"/admin/displayable_links.js\". An authenticated admin user can create a blog post with a malicious JavaScript payload in the title field, then trick another admin user into clicking a direct link to the \"/admin/displayable_links.js\" endpoint, causing the malicious script to execute in their browser.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"898630d8df48cf3ddb8b9942f59168b93216e3f8"}]}],"versions":["0.10","0.10.1","0.10.2","0.10.3","0.10.4","0.10.5","0.10.6","0.11","0.11.1","0.11.10","0.11.2","0.11.3","0.11.4","0.11.5","0.11.6","0.11.7","0.11.8","0.11.9","0.12","0.12.1","0.12.2","0.12.3","0.12.4","0.2.3","0.2.4","0.4","0.5","0.5.3","0.5.4","0.6","0.6.1","0.6.2","0.6.3","0.6.4","0.7","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.7.3","0.8","0.8.5","0.9","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.10","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","1.0.9","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.3.0","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.10","1.4.11","1.4.12","1.4.13","1.4.14","1.4.15","1.4.16","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.4.8","1.4.9","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","3.0.8","3.0.9","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.1.10","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.1.4","3.1.5","3.1.6","3.1.7","3.1.8","3.1.9","4.0.0","4.0.1","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.10","v0.10.1","v0.10.2","v0.10.3","v0.10.4","v0.10.5","v0.10.6","v0.11","v0.11.1","v0.11.10","v0.11.2","v0.11.3","v0.11.4","v0.11.5","v0.11.6","v0.11.7","v0.11.8","v0.11.9","v0.12","v0.12.1","v0.12.2","v0.12.3","v0.12.4","v0.2.3","v0.2.4","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.4","v0.5","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.6","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.6.4","v0.7","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.8","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.8.5","v0.9","v0.9.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.10","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.2.4","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.10","v1.4.11","v1.4.12","v1.4.13","v1.4.14","v1.4.15","v1.4.16","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.4.6","v1.4.7","v1.4.8","v1.4.9","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.0.5","v3.0.6","v3.0.7","v3.0.8","v3.0.9","v3.1.0","v3.1.1","v3.1.10","v3.1.2","v3.1.3","v3.1.4","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.1.9","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.1.0","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.2.3","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v5.0.0-alpha.1","v5.1.0","v5.1.1","v5.1.2","v5.1.3","v5.1.4","v6.0.0","v6.0.1","v6.1.0","wab-2015-03-05","wab-2015-03-05-2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-6050.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://advisory.checkmarx.net/advisory/CVE-2025-6050/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine/commit/898630d8df48cf3ddb8b9942f59168b93216e3f8"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine/discussions/2080"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
