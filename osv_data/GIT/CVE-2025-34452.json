{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-34452","published":"2025-12-18T22:15:56.473Z","modified":"2025-12-21T06:43:44.280147Z","details":"Streama versions 1.10.0 through 1.10.5 and prior to commit b7c8767 contain a combination of path traversal and server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities in that allow an authenticated attacker to write arbitrary files to the server filesystem. The issue exists in the subtitle download functionality, where user-controlled parameters are used to fetch remote content and construct file paths without proper validation. By supplying a crafted subtitle download URL and a path traversal sequence in the file name, an attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/streamaserver/streama","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b7c8767"}]}],"versions":["1.3.1_beta","1.3.3_beta","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.10","v1.0.11","v1.0.12","v1.0.13","v1.0.14","v1.0.15","v1.0.16","v1.0.17","v1.0.18","v1.0.19","v1.0.2","v1.0.20","v1.0.21","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.0.9_1","v1.1","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.10.5","v1.10.6","v1.2.1_beta","v1.2.3_beta","v1.2_beta","v1.3.0_beta","v1.3.2_beta","v1.4.0_beta","v1.4.1RC","v1.4.1RC2","v1.4.1RC3","v1.4.2","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.6.0-FINAL","v1.6.0-RC1","v1.6.0-RC10","v1.6.0-RC2","v1.6.0-RC3","v1.6.0-RC4","v1.6.0-RC5","v1.6.0-RC6","v1.6.0-RC7","v1.6.0-RC8","v1.6.0-RC9","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.4","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.6.7","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-RC1","v1.7.0-RC10","v1.7.0-RC11","v1.7.0-RC12","v1.7.0-RC13","v1.7.0-RC2","v1.7.0-RC3","v1.7.0-RC4","v1.7.0-RC5","v1.7.0-RC6","v1.7.0-RC7","v1.7.0-RC8","v1.7.0-RC9","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.8.0-beta","v1.8.1","v1.8.2","v1.8.3","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-34452.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://chocapikk.com/posts/2025/streama-path-traversal-ssrf/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/streama-subtitle-download-path-traversal-and-ssrf-leading-to-arbitrary-file-write"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/commit/b7c8767"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
