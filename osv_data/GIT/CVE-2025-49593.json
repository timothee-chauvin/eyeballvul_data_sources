Prior to STS version 2.31.0 and LTS version 2.27.7, if a Portainer administrator can be convinced to register a malicious container registry, or an existing container registry can be taken over, HTTP Headers (including registry authentication credentials or Portainer session tokens) may be leaked to that registry.
