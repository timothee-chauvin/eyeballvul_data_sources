  "details": "An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the MacOS Text-To-Speech class MacOSTTS of the significant-gravitas/autogpt project, affecting versions up to v0.5.0. The vulnerability arises from the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command within the `_speech` method of the MacOSTTS class. Specifically, the use of `os.system` to execute the `say` command with user-supplied text allows for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can inject shell commands. This issue is triggered when the AutoGPT instance is run with the `--speak` option enabled and configured with `TEXT_TO_SPEECH_PROVIDER=macos`, reflecting back a shell injection snippet. The impact of this vulnerability is the potential execution of arbitrary code on the instance running AutoGPT. The issue was addressed in version 5.1.0.",
