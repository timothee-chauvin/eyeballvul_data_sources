When using an ACL on a device connected to a bridge, Incus version 6.12 and 6.13 generates nftables rules for local services (DHCP, DNS...) that partially bypass security options `security.mac_filtering`, `security.ipv4_filtering` and `security.ipv6_filtering`. This can lead to DHCP pool exhaustion and opens the door for other attacks. A patch is available at commit 2516fb19ad8428454cb4edfe70c0a5f0dc1da214.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lxc/incus","events":[{"introduced":"11f8f9e6ae151984a7abd2d9f9b02a6f3c9af320"},{"fixed":"a7c33301738aede3c035063e973b1d885d9bac7c"}]}],"versions":["v6.12.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-52889.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lxc/incus/commit/2516fb19ad8428454cb4edfe70c0a5f0dc1da214"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lxc/incus/commit/a7c33301738aede3c035063e973b1d885d9bac7c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/lxc/incus/security/advisories/GHSA-9q7c-qmhm-jv86"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
