{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-24017","published":"2025-01-21T15:37:58Z","modified":"2025-10-21T19:32:36Z","aliases":["GHSA-wphc-5f2j-jhvg"],"summary":"YesWiki Vulnerable to Unauthenticated DOM Based XSS","details":"YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. Versions up to and including 4.4.5 are vulnerable to any end-user crafting a DOM based XSS on all of YesWiki's pages which is triggered when a user clicks on a malicious link. The vulnerability makes use of the search by tag feature. When a tag doesn't exist, the tag is reflected on the page and isn't properly sanitized on the server side which allows a malicious user to generate a link that will trigger an XSS on the client's side when clicked. This vulnerability allows any user to generate a malicious link that will trigger an account takeover when clicked, therefore allowing a user to steal other accounts, modify pages, comments, permissions, extract user data (emails), thus impacting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a YesWiki instance. Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/yeswiki/yeswiki","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c840f08d23405dee81e7cfa28f6bc4ab6f9f4365"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-24017.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-wphc-5f2j-jhvg"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/commit/c1e28b59394957902c31c850219e4504a20db98b"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L"}]}
