{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-38592","published":"2024-06-19T13:45:43.367Z","modified":"2025-12-05T05:25:38.575151Z","related":["SUSE-SU-2024:2571-1","SUSE-SU-2024:2896-1","SUSE-SU-2024:2973-1"],"summary":"drm/mediatek: Init `ddp_comp` with devm_kcalloc()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/mediatek: Init `ddp_comp` with devm_kcalloc()\n\nIn the case where `conn_routes` is true we allocate an extra slot in\nthe `ddp_comp` array but mtk_drm_crtc_create() never seemed to\ninitialize it in the test case I ran. For me, this caused a later\ncrash when we looped through the array in mtk_drm_crtc_mode_valid().\nThis showed up for me when I booted with `slub_debug=FZPUA` which\npoisons the memory initially. Without `slub_debug` I couldn't\nreproduce, presumably because the later code handles the value being\nNULL and in most cases (not guaranteed in all cases) the memory the\nallocator returned started out as 0.\n\nIt really doesn't hurt to initialize the array with devm_kcalloc()\nsince the array is small and the overhead of initting a handful of\nelements to 0 is small. In general initting memory to zero is a safer\npractice and usually it's suggested to only use the non-initting alloc\nfunctions if you really need to.\n\nLet's switch the function to use an allocation function that zeros the\nmemory. For me, this avoids the crash.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"01389b324c97ff8f04e9c33b9ee246084f9f6dd2"},{"fixed":"cf69d0af7db917b82aceaa44b7b1b9376609da22"},{"fixed":"9fe2cc3fa44f7ad7ba5f29c1a68b2b924c17b9b1"},{"fixed":"01a2c5123e27b3c4685bf2fc4c2e879f6e0c7b33"}]}],"versions":["v6.6","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.8.1","v6.8.10","v6.8.11","v6.8.2","v6.8.3","v6.8.4","v6.8.5","v6.8.6","v6.8.7","v6.8.8","v6.8.9","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7","v6.9.1","v6.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-38592.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.8.12"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.9.0"},{"fixed":"6.9.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-38592.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/01a2c5123e27b3c4685bf2fc4c2e879f6e0c7b33"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9fe2cc3fa44f7ad7ba5f29c1a68b2b924c17b9b1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cf69d0af7db917b82aceaa44b7b1b9376609da22"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/38xxx/CVE-2024-38592.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38592"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/38xxx/CVE-2024-38592.json"}}
