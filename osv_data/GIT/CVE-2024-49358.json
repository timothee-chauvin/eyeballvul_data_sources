{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-49358","published":"2024-10-24T21:25:57.320Z","modified":"2025-11-20T05:36:39.078121Z","aliases":["GHSA-3f6g-8r88-3mx5"],"summary":"ZimaOS vulnerable to Username Enumeration via API Responses","details":"ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http://<Server-IP>/v1/users/login` in ZimaOS returns distinct responses based on whether a username exists or the password is incorrect. This behavior can be exploited for username enumeration, allowing attackers to determine whether a user exists in the system or not. Attackers can leverage this information in further attacks, such as credential stuffing or targeted password brute-forcing. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/icewhaletech/zimaos","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"6a1d2ad717ee2833a4d0e400ab776a4a99fef6a7"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.2.4"}]}}],"versions":["0.4.8","0.4.8.1","0.4.9","0.4.9.1","0.4.9.2","0.4.9.3","0.4.9.4","0.5.0","1.0.0","1.1.0","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.3-beta1","1.2.4","1.2.4-beta1","1.2.4-beta2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-49358.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-3f6g-8r88-3mx5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://youtu.be/BClx2u8DMfM"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-203"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
