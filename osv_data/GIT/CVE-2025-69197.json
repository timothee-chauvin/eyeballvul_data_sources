{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-69197","published":"2026-01-06T00:44:23.399Z","modified":"2026-01-07T14:47:53.953793Z","aliases":["GHSA-rgmp-4873-r683"],"summary":"Pterodactyl TOTPs can be reused during validity window","details":"Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel. Versions 1.11.11 and below allow TOTP to be used multiple times during its validity window. Users with 2FA enabled are prompted to enter a token during sign-in, and afterward it is not sufficiently marked as used in the system. This allows an attacker who intercepts that token to use it in addition to a known username/password during the 60-second token validity window. The attacker must have intercepted a valid 2FA token (for example, during a screen share). This issue is fixed in version 1.12.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"09caa0d4995bd924b53b9a9e9b4883ac27bd5607"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0-beta","v0.1.1-beta","v0.1.2-beta","v0.2.0-beta","v0.3.0-beta","v0.4.0-beta","v0.4.1-beta","v0.5.0","v0.6.4","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.10","v0.7.11","v0.7.12","v0.7.13","v0.7.14","v0.7.15","v0.7.16","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.4-h.1","v0.7.5","v0.7.6","v0.7.7","v0.7.8","v0.7.8-fixed","v0.7.9","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-beta.6","v1.0.0-beta.7","v1.0.0-rc.1","v1.0.0-rc.2","v1.0.0-rc.3","v1.0.0-rc.4","v1.0.0-rc.5","v1.0.0-rc.6","v1.0.0-rc.7","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.10.0","v1.10.1","v1.10.2","v1.10.3","v1.10.4","v1.11.0","v1.11.0-rc.1","v1.11.0-rc.2","v1.11.1","v1.11.2","v1.11.3","v1.11.4","v1.11.5","v1.11.6","v1.11.7","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.5","v1.6.6","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-69197.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/69xxx/CVE-2025-69197.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/032bf076d92bb2f929fa69c1bac1b89f26b8badf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/releases/tag/v1.12.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-rgmp-4873-r683"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69197"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-287","CWE-294"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/69xxx/CVE-2025-69197.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
