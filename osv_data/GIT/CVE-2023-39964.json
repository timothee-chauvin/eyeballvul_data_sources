In version 1.4.3, arbitrary file reads allow an attacker to read arbitrary important configuration files on the server. In the `api/v1/file.go` file, there is a function called `LoadFromFile`, which directly reads the file by obtaining the requested path `parameter[path]`. The request parameters are not filtered, resulting in a background arbitrary file reading vulnerability. Version 1.5.0 has a patch for this issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/1panel-dev/1panel","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"39d8b0d98c563308df966a676a5f8aec976d10d1"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-39964.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/releases/tag/v1.5.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/security/advisories/GHSA-pv7q-v9mv-9mh5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
