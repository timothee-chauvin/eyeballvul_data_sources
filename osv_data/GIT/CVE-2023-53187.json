This has two consequences:\n\n1) We move it out of the list of new block groups associated to the\n   current transaction. So the block group creation is not finished and\n   if we attempt to delete the bg because it's unused, we will not find\n   the block group item in the extent tree (or the new block group tree),\n   its device extent items in the device tree etc, resulting in the\n   deletion to fail due to the missing items;\n\n2) We don't increment the reference count on the block group when we\n   move it to the list of unused block groups, because we assumed the\n   block group was on the list of block groups to reclaim, and in that\n   case it already has the correct reference count. However the block\n   group was on the list of new block groups, in which case no extra\n   reference was taken because it's local to the current task. This\n   later results in doing an extra reference count decrement when\n   removing the block group from the unused list, eventually leading the\n   reference count to 0.\n\nThis second case was caught when running generic/297 from fstests, which\nproduced the following assertion failure and stack trace:\n\n  [589.559] assertion failed: refcount_read(&block_group->refs) == 1, in
