Prior to Apollo Sandbox version 2.7.2 and Apollo Explorer version 3.7.3, a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was identified. The vulnerability arises from missing origin validation in the client-side code that handles window.postMessage events. A malicious website can send forged messages to the embedding page, causing the victim’s browser to execute arbitrary GraphQL queries or mutations against their GraphQL server while authenticated with the victim’s cookies. This issue has been patched in Apollo Sandbox version 2.7.2 and Apollo Explorer version 3.7.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apollographql/embeddable-explorer","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e6d760d1635bae698abf1ad2a286761c4364491e"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.7.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apollographql/embeddable-explorer","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e6d760d1635bae698abf1ad2a286761c4364491e"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.3"}]}}],"versions":["@apollo/explorer-helpers@0.1.0","@apollo/explorer-helpers@0.1.1","@apollo/explorer-helpers@0.1.2","@apollo/explorer-helpers@0.1.4","@apollo/explorer-helpers@0.1.5","@apollo/explorer@1.0.0","@apollo/explorer@1.1.0","@apollo/explorer@1.1.1","@apollo/explorer@1.2.0","@apollo/explorer@2.0.0","@apollo/explorer@2.0.1","@apollo/explorer@2.0.2","@apollo/explorer@3.0.0","@apollo/explorer@3.1.0","@apollo/explorer@3.1.1","@apollo/explorer@3.2.0","@apollo/explorer@3.3.0","@apollo/explorer@3.4.0","@apollo/explorer@3.5.0","@apollo/explorer@3.6.0","@apollo/explorer@3.7.0","@apollo/explorer@3.7.1","@apollo/explorer@3.7.2","@apollo/sandbox@0.1.0","@apollo/sandbox@0.2.0","@apollo/sandbox@0.2.1","@apollo/sandbox@0.3.0","@apollo/sandbox@1.0.0","@apollo/sandbox@1.0.1","@apollo/sandbox@1.0.2","@apollo/sandbox@1.0.3","@apollo/sandbox@2.0.0","@apollo/sandbox@2.1.0","@apollo/sandbox@2.1.1","@apollo/sandbox@2.2.0","@apollo/sandbox@2.3.0","@apollo/sandbox@2.4.0","@apollo/sandbox@2.5.0","@apollo/sandbox@2.5.1","@apollo/sandbox@2.6.0","@apollo/sandbox@2.7.0","@apollo/sandbox@2.7.1","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.2","v0.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59845.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/embeddable-explorer/security/advisories/GHSA-w87v-7w53-wwxv"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-346","CWE-352"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N"}]}
