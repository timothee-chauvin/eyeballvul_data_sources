  "details": "parisneo/lollms version 9.5 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) attacks due to insufficient path sanitization. The `sanitize_path_from_endpoint` function fails to properly sanitize Windows-style paths (backward slash `\\`), allowing attackers to perform directory traversal attacks on Windows systems. This vulnerability can be exploited through various routes, including `personalities` and `/del_preset`, to read or delete any file on the Windows filesystem, compromising the system's availability.",
