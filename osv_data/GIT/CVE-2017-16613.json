The Swift object store and proxy server are saving (unhashed) tokens retrieved from the Swauth middleware authentication mechanism to a log file as part of a GET URI. This allows attackers to bypass authentication by inserting a token into an X-Auth-Token header of a new request. NOTE: github.com/openstack/swauth URLs do not mean that Swauth is maintained by an official OpenStack project team.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openstack-archive/swauth","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"70af7986265a3defea054c46efc82d0698917298"}]}],"versions":["1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.8","1.1.0","1.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-16613.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openstack/swauth","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-16613.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openstack/swift","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-16613.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101926"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=882314"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1655781"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/openstack/swauth/commit/70af7986265a3defea054c46efc82d0698917298"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-4044"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
