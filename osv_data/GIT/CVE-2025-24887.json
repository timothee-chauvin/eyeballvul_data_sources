In versions starting from 6.4.8 to before 6.4.10, the allow/deny lists can be bypassed, allowing a user to change attributes that are intended to be unmodifiable by the user. It is possible to toggle the `external` flag on/off and change the own token value for a user. It is also possible to edit attributes that are not in the allow list, such as `otp_qr` and `otp_activated`. If external users exist in the OpenCTI setup and the information about these users identities is sensitive, the above vulnerabilities can be used to enumerate existing user accounts as a standard low privileged user. This issue has been patched in version 6.4.10.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/opencti-platform/opencti","events":[{"introduced":"7d5bb142deacc08e89aadcedfe2ebcb62427dcdf"},{"fixed":"38898481dc550a63d32e4e00a5a10d7b5f714e87"}]}],"versions":["6.4.8","6.4.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-24887.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/security/advisories/GHSA-8262-pw2q-5qc3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-284","CWE-657"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
