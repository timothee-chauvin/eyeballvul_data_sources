Prior to version 20251107, pdfminer.six will execute arbitrary code from a malicious pickle file if provided with a malicious PDF file. The `CMapDB._load_data()` function in pdfminer.six uses `pickle.loads()` to deserialize pickle files. These pickle files are supposed to be part of the pdfminer.six distribution stored in the `cmap/` directory, but a malicious PDF can specify an alternative directory and filename as long as the filename ends in `.pickle.gz`. A malicious, zipped pickle file can then contain code which will automatically execute when the PDF is processed. Version 20251107 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b808ee05dd7f0c8ea8ec34bdf394d40e63501086"}]}],"versions":["20160614","20170418","20170419","20170720","20181108","20191020","20191107","20191110","20200104","20200121","20200124","20200402","20200517","20200720","20200726","20201018","20211012","20220319","20220506","20220524","20221105","20240706","20250327","20250416","20250506"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64512.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/commit/b808ee05dd7f0c8ea8ec34bdf394d40e63501086"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/releases/tag/20251107"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/security/advisories/GHSA-wf5f-4jwr-ppcp"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/11/msg00017.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
