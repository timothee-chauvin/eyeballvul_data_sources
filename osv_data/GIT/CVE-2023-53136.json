the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naf_unix: fix struct pid leaks in OOB support\n\nsyzbot reported struct pid leak [1].\n\nIssue is that queue_oob() calls maybe_add_creds() which potentially\nholds a reference on a pid.\n\nBut skb->destructor is not set (either directly or by calling\nunix_scm_to_skb())\n\nThis means that subsequent kfree_skb() or consume_skb() would leak\nthis reference.\n\nIn this fix, I chose to fully support scm even for the OOB message.\n\n[1]\nBUG: memory leak\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881053e7f80 (size 128):\ncomm
