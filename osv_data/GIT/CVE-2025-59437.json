NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2024-29415. NOTE: in current versions of several applications, connection attempts to the IP address 0 (interpreted as 0.0.0.0) are blocked with error messages such as net::ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID. However, in some situations that depend on both application version and operating system, connection attempts to 0 and 0.0.0.0 are considered connection attempts to 127.0.0.1 (and, for this reason, a false value of isPublic would be preferable).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/indutny/node-ip","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"3b0994a74eca51df01f08c40d6a65ba0e1845d04"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.6","v2.0.0","v2.0.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59437.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cosmosofcyberspace.github.io/CVE-Application-Document.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/tags"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
