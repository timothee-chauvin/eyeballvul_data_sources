Authenticated admin users can enable webhooks in Zammad, which are triggered as POST requests when certain conditions are met. If a webhook endpoint returned a redirect response, Zammad would follow it automatically with another GET request. This could be abused by an attacker to cause GET requests for example in the local network.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/zammad/zammad","events":[{"introduced":"1f09f838a2c9e484bb4f47e1abeeca3d763d4e7d"},{"fixed":"b775416be8964f23173fde0c64e2974ab6a1bb74"}]}],"versions":["6.4.0","6.4.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-32358.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://zammad.com/en/advisories/zaa-2025-01"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
