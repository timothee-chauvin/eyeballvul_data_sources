An off-by-one error when processing malformed TLS-CBC ciphertext could cause the receiving side to include in the HMAC computation exactly 64K bytes of data following the record buffer, aka an over-read. The MAC comparison will subsequently fail and the connection will be closed. This could be used for denial of service. No information leak occurs.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/randombit/botan","events":[{"introduced":"c83872bb775916d88196fb2eca6971329711e2d3"},{"fixed":"d7d080992372cf4fbd569cce1d8cd6aa7599fa0d"}]}],"versions":["1.11.32","1.11.33","1.11.34","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.1.0","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-9860.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://botan.randombit.net/security.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=7434"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
