{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-29895","published":"2024-05-13T14:33:27.594Z","modified":"2025-12-05T04:18:08.773556Z","aliases":["GHSA-cr28-x256-xf5m"],"summary":"Cacti command injection in cmd_realtime.php","details":"Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. A command injection vulnerability on the 1.3.x DEV branch allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary command on the server when `register_argc_argv` option of PHP is `On`. In `cmd_realtime.php` line 119, the `$poller_id` used as part of the command execution is sourced from `$_SERVER['argv']`, which can be controlled by URL when `register_argc_argv` option of PHP is `On`. And this option is `On` by default in many environments such as the main PHP Docker image for PHP.
