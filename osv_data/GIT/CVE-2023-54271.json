The field is initialized by\nioc_pd_init() and never cleared. The NULL deref is caused by\nblkcg_activate_policy() installing blkg_policy_data before initializing it.\n\nblkcg_activate_policy() was doing the following:\n\n1. Allocate pd's for all existing blkg's and install them in blkg->pd[].\n2. Initialize all pd's.\n3. Online all pd's.\n\nblkcg_activate_policy() only grabs the queue_lock and may release and\nre-acquire the lock as allocation may need to sleep. ioc_weight_write()\ngrabs blkcg->lock and iterates all its blkg's. The two can race and if\nioc_weight_write() runs during #1 or between #1 and #2, it can encounter a\npd which is not initialized yet, leading to crash.\n\nThe crash can be reproduced with the following script:\n\n  #!/bin/bash\n\n  echo +io > /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.subtree_control\n  systemd-run --unit touch-sda --scope dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1 iflag=direct\n  echo 100 > /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/io.weight\n  bash -c \"echo '8:0 enable=1' > /sys/fs/cgroup/io.cost.qos\" &\n  sleep .2\n  echo 100 > /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/io.weight\n\nwith the following patch applied:\n\n> diff --git a/block/blk-cgroup.c b/block/blk-cgroup.c\n> index fc49be622e05..38d671d5e10c 100644\n> --- a/block/blk-cgroup.c\n> +++ b/block/blk-cgroup.c\n> @@ -1553,6 +1553,12 @@ int blkcg_activate_policy(struct gendisk *disk, const struct blkcg_policy *pol)\n> \t\tpd->online = false;\n> \t}\n>\n> +       if (system_state == SYSTEM_RUNNING) {\n> +               spin_unlock_irq(&q->queue_lock);\n> +               ssleep(1);\n> +               spin_lock_irq(&q->queue_lock);\n> +       }\n> +\n> \t/* all allocated, init in the same order */\n> \tif (pol->pd_init_fn)\n> \t\tlist_for_each_entry_reverse(blkg, &q->blkg_list, q_node)\n\nI don't see a reason why all pd's should be allocated, initialized and\nonlined together. The only ordering requirement is that parent blkgs to be\ninitialized and onlined before children, which is guaranteed from the\nwalking order. Let's fix the bug by allocating, initializing and onlining pd\nfor each blkg and holding blkcg->lock over initialization and onlining. This\nensures that an installed blkg is always fully initialized and onlined\nremoving the the race window.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9d179b865449b351ad5cb76dbea480c9170d4a27"},{"fixed":"e39ef7880d1057b2ebcdb013405f4d84a257db23"},{"fixed":"7d63c6f9765339dcfc34b7365ced7c518012e4fe"},{"fixed":"ec14a87ee1999b19d8b7ed0fa95fea80644624ae"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.4.1","v6.4.10","v6.4.11","v6.4.12","v6.4.13","v6.4.14","v6.4.15","v6.4.2","v6.4.3","v6.4.4","v6.4.5","v6.4.6","v6.4.7","v6.4.8","v6.4.9","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.5.1","v6.5.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54271.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.4.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.16"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.5.0"},{"fixed":"6.5.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-54271.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7d63c6f9765339dcfc34b7365ced7c518012e4fe"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e39ef7880d1057b2ebcdb013405f4d84a257db23"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ec14a87ee1999b19d8b7ed0fa95fea80644624ae"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54271.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54271"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/54xxx/CVE-2023-54271.json"}}
