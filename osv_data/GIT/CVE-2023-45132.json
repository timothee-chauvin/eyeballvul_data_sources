An issue present starting in version 1.3 and prior to version 1.6 allows someone to bypass the WAF when a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` IP matches `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` rules. This old code was arranged to allow older NGINX versions to also support `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` when multiple reverse proxies were present. The issue is patched in version 1.6. As a workaround, do not set any `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` for older versions.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wargio/naxsi","events":[{"introduced":"b77c17261aba04e749a5072b96f97294bf830149"},{"fixed":"f74611640b76a798cdedcc3fa1147b69eaac969f"}]}],"versions":["1.3","1.4","1.4rc1","1.5","1.5rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-45132.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/wargio/naxsi/commit/1b712526ed3314dd6be7e8b0259eabda63c19537"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/wargio/naxsi/pull/103"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/wargio/naxsi/security/advisories/GHSA-7qjc-q4j9-pc8x"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-693"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H"}]}
