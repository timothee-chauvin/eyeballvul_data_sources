  "details": "In the git-tag-annotation-action (open source GitHub Action) before version 1.0.1, an attacker can execute arbitrary (*) shell commands if they can control the value of [the `tag` input] or manage to alter the value of [the `GITHUB_REF` environment variable]. The problem has been patched in version 1.0.1. If you don't use the `tag` input you are most likely safe. The `GITHUB_REF` environment variable is protected by the GitHub Actions environment so attacks from there should be impossible. If you must use the `tag` input and cannot upgrade to `> 1.0.0` make sure that the value is not controlled by another Action.",
