The problem has been patched in version 1.0.1. If you don't use the `tag` input you are most likely safe. The `GITHUB_REF` environment variable is protected by the GitHub Actions environment so attacks from there should be impossible. If you must use the `tag` input and cannot upgrade to `> 1.0.0` make sure that the value is not controlled by another Action.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"21fa0360d55070a1d6b999d027db44cc21a7b48d"},{"fixed":"9f30756375cc4b1b6c66f274fc9c591fa901455a"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-15272.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action/commit/9f30756375cc4b1b6c66f274fc9c591fa901455a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action/releases/tag/v1.0.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action/security/advisories/GHSA-hgx2-4pp9-357g"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
