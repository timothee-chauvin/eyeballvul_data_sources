This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wpchill/modula-lite","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"90c8eb982f71b31584d9be9359e3b594e03927d7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-13645.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/modula-best-grid-gallery/tags/2.13.2/includes/admin/class-modula-gallery-upload.php#L1025"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/modula-best-grid-gallery/tags/2.13.2/includes/admin/class-modula-gallery-upload.php#L1119"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3395701/modula-best-grid-gallery#file5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3407949/modula-best-grid-gallery"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/080683bb-713f-4aa8-b635-90c96f358bec?source=cve"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/WPChill/modula-lite/commit/90c8eb982f71b31584d9be9359e3b594e03927d7"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
