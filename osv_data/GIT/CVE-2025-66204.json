Version 1.6.4 contains a brute-force protection bypass where an attacker can indefinitely reset the counter by modifying `X-Forwarded-For` on each request, gaining unlimited password guessing attempts, effectively bypassing all brute-force protection. The application fully trusts the `X-Forwarded-For` header without validating it or restricting its usage. This issue is fixed in version 1.6.5.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wbce/wbce_cms","events":[{"introduced":"15be89e102f1da4ac935e1d2b6af1dafa962a787"},{"fixed":"458d4385482770a7f6e77361e64265c1413b0c99"}]}],"versions":["1.6.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66204.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66204.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/WBCE/WBCE_CMS/commit/3765baddf27f31bbbea9c0228c452268621b25e5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/WBCE/WBCE_CMS/releases/tag/1.6.5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/WBCE/WBCE_CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-f676-f375-m7mw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66204"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-307","CWE-693"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66204.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
