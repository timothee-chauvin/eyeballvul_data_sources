{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2016-6658","published":"2018-03-29T22:29:00Z","modified":"2025-10-21T03:54:13.931790Z","details":"Applications in cf-release before 245 can be configured and pushed with a user-provided custom buildpack using a URL pointing to the buildpack. Although it is not recommended, a user can specify a credential in the URL (basic auth or OAuth) to access the buildpack through the CLI. For example, the user could include a GitHub username and password in the URL to access a private repo. Because the URL to access the buildpack is stored unencrypted, an operator with privileged access to the Cloud Controller database could view these credentials.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1a84cd71377a1ac645f76c686156142ea0685067"}]}],"versions":["-","list","log","rc145.0","scotty_09012012","v","v100","v101","v102","v103","v104","v105","v106","v107","v108","v109","v110","v111","v112","v113","v114","v115","v116","v117","v118","v119","v119-fixed","v120","v121","v122","v123","v124","v125","v126","v127","v128","v129","v130","v131","v132","v133","v134","v135","v136","v137","v138","v139","v140","v141","v142","v143","v144","v145","v146","v147","v148","v149","v150","v151","v152","v153","v154","v155","v156","v157","v158","v159","v160","v161","v162","v163","v164","v165","v166","v168","v169","v170","v171","v172","v173","v175","v176","v177","v178","v179","v180","v182","v183","v186","v187","v188","v189","v190","v191","v192","v193","v194","v195","v196","v197","v198","v199","v200","v201","v202","v203","v204","v205","v206","v207","v208","v209","v210","v211","v212","v213","v214","v215","v217","v218","v219","v220","v221","v222","v223","v224","v225","v226","v227","v228","v229","v230","v231","v232","v233","v234","v235","v236","v237","v238","v239","v240","v241","v242","v243","v244","v68","v69","v70","v71","v72","v73","v74","v75","v76","v77","v78","v79","v80","v81","v82","v83","v84","v85","v86","v87","v88","v89","v90","v91","v92","v93","v94","v95","v95-fixed","v96","v97","v98","v99","works-for-us"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2016-6658.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2016-6658"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
