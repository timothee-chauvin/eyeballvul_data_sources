  "details": "ManageWiki is a MediaWiki extension allowing users to manage wikis. Prior to commit 2f177dc, ManageWiki is vulnerable to reflected or stored XSS in the review dialog. A logged-in attacker must change a form field to include a malicious payload. If that same user then opens the \"Review Changes\" dialog, the payload will be rendered and executed in the context of their own session. This issue has been patched in commit 2f177dc.",
