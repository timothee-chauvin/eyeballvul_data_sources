Starting in version 2.17.0 and prior to version 2.19.1, a flaw in the authentication bypass logic allows unauthenticated requests to match certain unanchored regex patterns in the URL. Attackers can craft URLs containing substrings like \"/api/items/1/cover\" in a query parameter (?r=/api/items/1/cover) to partially bypass authentication or trigger server crashes under certain routes. This could lead to information disclosure of otherwise protected data and, in some cases, a complete denial of service (server crash) if downstream code expects an authenticated user object. Version 2.19.1 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf","events":[{"introduced":"2b0ba7d1e28f8cc0bcce153cbcde1a06927f93d9"},{"fixed":"725192fbc0f5b289bc70a4eed451710359464ca6"}]}],"versions":["v2.17.0","v2.17.1","v2.17.2","v2.17.3","v2.17.4","v2.17.5","v2.17.6","v2.17.7","v2.18.0","v2.18.1","v2.19.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-25205.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/blob/1a3d70d04100924d41391acb55bd8ddca486a4fa/server/Auth.js#L17-L41"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/commit/bf8407274e3ee300af1927ee660d078a7a801e1c"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/commit/ec6537656925a43871b07cfee12c9f383844d224"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/pull/3584"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/security/advisories/GHSA-pg8v-5jcv-wrvw"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-202","CWE-287","CWE-400"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H"}]}
