Prior to version 10.1.0, DNN’s URL/path handling and template rendering can allow specially crafted input to be reflected into a user profile that is returned to the browser. In these cases, the application does not sufficiently neutralize or encode characters that are meaningful in HTML, so an attacker can cause a victim’s browser to interpret attacker-controlled content as part of the page’s HTML. This issue has been patched in version 10.1.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dnnsoftware/dnn.platform","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"f66ba091c1d9361bbe961801c18b9e951c436c41"}]}],"versions":["10.0.0-rc3","v10.0.0","v10.0.0-rc1","v10.0.0-rc2","v10.0.1","v10.0.1-rc1","v10.0.1-rc2","v10.0.1-rc3","v10.1.0-rc1","v7.2.1.367-stable","v7.3.2.109-stable","v9.1.0","v9.10.0","v9.10.0-rc1","v9.10.0-rc2","v9.10.1","v9.10.1-rc1","v9.10.2","v9.10.2-rc1","v9.11.0","v9.11.0-rc1","v9.11.0-rc2","v9.11.0-rc3","v9.11.0-rc4","v9.11.0-rc5","v9.11.0-rc6","v9.11.0-rc7","v9.11.1","v9.11.1-rc1","v9.11.1-rc2","v9.11.1-rc3","v9.11.2","v9.11.2-rc1","v9.12.0","v9.12.0-rc1","v9.13.0","v9.13.0-rc1","v9.13.0-rc2","v9.13.0-rc3","v9.13.1","v9.13.1-rc1","v9.13.2","v9.13.2-rc1","v9.13.3","v9.13.3-rc1","v9.13.4","v9.13.4-rc1","v9.13.5","v9.13.5-rc1","v9.13.6","v9.13.6-rc1","v9.13.7","v9.13.7-rc1","v9.13.8","v9.13.8-rc1","v9.13.9","v9.13.9-rc1","v9.2.0","v9.2.1","v9.2.1-rc0","v9.2.1-rc1","v9.2.2","v9.2.2-rc0","v9.2.2-rc1","v9.2.2-rc2","v9.2.2-rc3","v9.3.0","v9.3.0-rc0","v9.3.0-rc1","v9.3.0-rc2","v9.3.1","v9.3.1-rc0","v9.3.2","v9.3.2-rc0","v9.4.0","v9.4.0-rc0","v9.4.0-rc1","v9.4.1","v9.4.1-rc1","v9.4.2","v9.4.2-rc1","v9.4.3","v9.4.3-rc1","v9.4.4","v9.4.4-rc1","v9.5.0","v9.5.0-rc1","v9.5.0-rc2","v9.5.1-rc1","v9.6.0","v9.6.0-rc1","v9.6.0-rc2","v9.6.0-rc3","v9.6.1","v9.6.1-rc1","v9.6.2","v9.6.2-rc1","v9.6.2-rc2","v9.6.2-rc3","v9.7.0","v9.7.0-rc1","v9.7.0-rc2","v9.7.1","v9.7.1-rc1","v9.7.2","v9.7.2-rc1","v9.8.0","v9.8.0-rc1","v9.8.0-rc2","v9.8.1","v9.8.1-rc1","v9.9.0","v9.9.0-rc1","v9.9.0-rc2","v9.9.1","v9.9.1-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59821.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform/security/advisories/GHSA-jc4g-c8ww-5738"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
