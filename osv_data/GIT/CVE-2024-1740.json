The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization. This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and external user details without valid permissions.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"c57cd50fa0477fd2a2efe60810c0099eebd66f54"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-1740.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/c1a51f71-628e-4eb5-ac35-50bf64832cfd"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/c57cd50fa0477fd2a2efe60810c0099eebd66f54"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
