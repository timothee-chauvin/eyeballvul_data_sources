{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2017-5344","published":"2017-02-17T07:59:00Z","modified":"2025-10-21T04:24:08.014520Z","details":"An issue was discovered in dotCMS through 3.6.1. The findChildrenByFilter() function which is called by the web accessible path /categoriesServlet performs string interpolation and direct SQL query execution. SQL quote escaping and a keyword blacklist were implemented in a new class, SQLUtil (main/java/com/dotmarketing/common/util/SQLUtil.java), as part of the remediation of CVE-2016-8902; however, these can be overcome in the case of the q and inode parameters to the /categoriesServlet path. Overcoming these controls permits a number of blind boolean SQL injection vectors in either parameter. The /categoriesServlet web path can be accessed remotely and without authentication in a default dotCMS deployment.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/dotcms/core","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"b1834b29439a94115033e7f4ed00cb0abe9fed96"}]}],"versions":["3.0","3.2","3.2.1","3.5","3.5_Preview01","3.5_Preview02","3.6.0","3.6.1","pre3.5buildrevert"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-5344.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://dotcms.com/security/SI-39"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/34"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/xdrr/webapp-exploits/blob/master/vendors/dotcms/2017.01.blind-sqli/dotcms-dump.sh"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96259"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41377/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
