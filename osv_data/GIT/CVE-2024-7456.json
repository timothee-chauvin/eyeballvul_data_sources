{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-7456","published":"2024-11-01T12:15:03Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:36:46Z","details":"A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6a0bc201181e0f4a0cc375ccf4ef0d7ae65c8a8e"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-7456.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/bfb3015e-5642-4d94-ab49-e8b49c4e07e4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/6a0bc201181e0f4a0cc375ccf4ef0d7ae65c8a8e"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
