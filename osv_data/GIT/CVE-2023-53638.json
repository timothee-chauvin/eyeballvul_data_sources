When the work later\nruns, it's a use after free.\n\nMove the cancelation of intr_poll_task from octep_remove into\noctep_device_cleanup. This does not change anything in the octep_remove\nflow, but octep_device_cleanup is called also in the octep_probe error\npath, where the cancelation is needed.\n\nNote that the cancelation of ctrl_mbox_task has to follow\nintr_poll_task's, because the ctrl_mbox_task may be queued by\nintr_poll_task.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"24d4333233b378114106a1327d3d635a004f4387"},{"fixed":"62312e2f6466b5f0a120542a38b410d88a34ed00"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"24d4333233b378114106a1327d3d635a004f4387"},{"fixed":"758c91078165ae641b698750a72eafe7968b3756"}]}],"versions":["v6.3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.4.1","v6.4.10","v6.4.11","v6.4.2","v6.4.3","v6.4.4","v6.4.5","v6.4.6","v6.4.7","v6.4.8","v6.4.9","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53638.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.4.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.12"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53638.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/62312e2f6466b5f0a120542a38b410d88a34ed00"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/758c91078165ae641b698750a72eafe7968b3756"}]}
