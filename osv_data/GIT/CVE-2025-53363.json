In versions 1.2.0 through 1.7.2, dpanel allows authenticated users to read arbitrary files from the server via the /api/app/compose/get-from-uri API endpoint. The vulnerability exists in the GetFromUri function in app/application/http/controller/compose.go, where the uri parameter is passed directly to os.ReadFile without proper validation or access control. A logged-in attacker can exploit this flaw to read sensitive files from the host system, leading to information disclosure. No patched version is available as of this writing.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/donknap/dpanel","events":[{"introduced":"fad77f5962f2bf54a38afb71ca9dbdc6c3c63049"}]}],"versions":["docker-cli-v1","toolchains-v1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v1.5.2","v1.5.3","v1.5.4","v1.5.5","v1.6.0","v1.6.1","v1.6.2","v1.6.3","v1.6.3.1","v1.6.3.2","v1.6.4","v1.7.0","v1.7.1","v1.7.2","v1.7.3","v1.7.3.1","v1.7.3.2","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.8.1.1","v1.8.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53363.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/donknap/dpanel/security/advisories/GHSA-gcqf-pxgg-gw8q"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-73"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
