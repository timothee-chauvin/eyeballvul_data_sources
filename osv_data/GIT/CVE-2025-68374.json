This means that the\nRCU pointer has been acquired before rcu_read_lock(), which renders\nrcu_read_lock() ineffective and could lead to a use-after-free.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"4469315439827290923fce4f3f672599cabeb366"},{"fixed":"21989cb5034c835b212385a2afadf279d8069da0"},{"fixed":"a4bd1caf591faeae44cb10b6517e7dacb5139bda"},{"fixed":"f98b191f78124405294481dea85f8a22a3eb0a59"},{"fixed":"0dc76205549b4c25705e54345f211b9f66e018a0"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.59","v6.12.6","v6.12.60","v6.12.61","v6.12.62","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.10","v6.17.11","v6.17.12","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.4","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68374.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.5.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.63"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.13"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68374.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0dc76205549b4c25705e54345f211b9f66e018a0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/21989cb5034c835b212385a2afadf279d8069da0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a4bd1caf591faeae44cb10b6517e7dacb5139bda"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f98b191f78124405294481dea85f8a22a3eb0a59"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68374.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68374"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68374.json"}}
