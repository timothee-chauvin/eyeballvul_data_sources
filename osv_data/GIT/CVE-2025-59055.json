  "details": "InstantCMS is a free and open source content management system. A blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in InstantCMS up to and including 2.17.3 allows authenticated remote attackers to make nay HTTP/HTTPS request via the package parameter. It is possible to make any HTTP/HTTPS request to any website in installer functionality. Due to such vulnerability it is possible to for example scan local network, call local services and its functions, conduct a DoS attack, and/or disclose a server's real IP if it's behind a reverse proxy. It is also possible to exhaust server resources by sending plethora of such requests. As of time of publication, no patched releases are available.",
