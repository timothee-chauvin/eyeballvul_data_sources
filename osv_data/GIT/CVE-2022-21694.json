The website mode of the onionshare allows to use a hardened CSP, which will block any scripts and external resources. It is not possible to configure this CSP for individual pages and therefore the security enhancement cannot be used for websites using javascript or external resources like fonts or images.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6642c25959f14daeb4a572798ccf4acd765d5795"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-21694.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/security/advisories/GHSA-h29c-wcm8-883h"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/issues/1389"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/releases/tag/v2.5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-732"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
