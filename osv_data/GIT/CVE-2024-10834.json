{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-10834","published":"2025-03-20T10:15:20.753Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:23:09.842603Z","details":"eosphoros-ai/db-gpt version 0.6.0 contains a vulnerability in the RAG-knowledge endpoint that allows for arbitrary file write. The issue arises from the ability to pass an absolute path to a call to `os.path.join`, enabling an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the target server. This vulnerability can be exploited by setting the `doc_file.filename` to an absolute path, which can lead to overwriting system files or creating new SSH-key entries.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/eosphoros-ai/db-gpt","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"b34295562924046c229f0fd424ac3c7b54b7ecc8"}]}],"versions":["0.4.1","v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4-alpha","v0.0.5-beta","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.2.2","v0.2.3","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.3.3","v0.3.4","v0.3.5","v0.3.6","v0.3.7","v0.3.8","v0.3.9","v0.4.0","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.4.4","v0.4.5","v0.4.6","v0.4.7","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.5.10","v0.5.2","v0.5.3","v0.5.4","v0.5.5","v0.5.6","v0.5.7","v0.5.8","v0.5.9","v0.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-10834.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://huntr.com/bounties/0d598508-151a-4050-9ccd-31bb82955e7a"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
