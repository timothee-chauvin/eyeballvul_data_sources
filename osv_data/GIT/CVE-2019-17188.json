An attacker can bypass a front-end restriction and upload PHP code to the webserver, by providing image data and the image/jpeg content type, with a .php extension. This occurs because the code relies on the getimagesize function.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/fecshop/yii2_fecshop","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"b15d7ed0f9ede3a75cbe971f10688567c5a95e9b"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0.0","1.0.0.1","1.0.0.2","1.0.0.3","1.0.0.4","1.0.0.5","1.0.0.6","1.0.0.7","1.0.0.8","1.0.0.9","1.0.1.1","1.0.1.2","1.0.1.3","1.0.1.4","1.1.1","1.1.2.1","1.1.2.2","1.1.2.3","1.1.2.4","1.1.2.5","1.1.2.6","1.1.2.7","1.1.2.8","1.1.2.9","1.1.3.0","1.1.3.1","1.1.3.2","1.1.3.3","1.1.3.4","1.1.3.5","1.1.3.6","1.1.3.7","1.1.3.8","1.1.3.9","1.1.4.1","1.1.4.2","1.1.4.3","1.1.4.4","1.1.4.5","1.1.4.6","1.1.4.7","1.2.1.1","1.2.1.2","1.2.2.1","1.2.2.2","1.2.2.3","1.2.2.4","1.2.2.5","1.2.2.6","1.2.2.7","1.2.2.8","1.3.0.0","1.3.0.1","1.3.1.0","1.3.2.0","1.3.2.1","1.4.0.0","1.4.0.1","1.4.1.0","1.4.2.0","1.4.2.1","1.4.3.0","1.4.3.1","1.4.3.2","1.4.4.0","1.4.5.0","1.4.6.0","1.4.6.1","1.4.6.3","1.4.6.4","1.5.0.0","1.5.1.0","1.5.1.1","1.6.0.0","1.6.1.0","1.6.2.0","1.6.3.0","1.7.0.0","1.7.1.0","1.7.2.0","1.7.3.0","1.7.4.0","1.8.0.0","1.9.0.0","1.9.1.0","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.3.3","2.3.4","v1.4.6.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-17188.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/fecshop/yii2_fecshop/issues/77"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
