Prior to version 2.2.18, Rack::QueryParser enforces its params_limit only for parameters separated by &, while still splitting on both & and ;. As a result, attackers could use ; separators to bypass the parameter count limit and submit more parameters than intended. Applications or middleware that directly invoke Rack::QueryParser with its default configuration (no explicit delimiter) could be exposed to increased CPU and memory consumption. This can be abused as a limited denial-of-service vector. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.18.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rack/rack","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0f76d43c0d5624bd0d325df4f0a63f5e1faa7254"}]}],"versions":["0.1","0.2","0.3","1.0","1.1","1.2","1.2.1","1.3.0","1.3.0.beta","1.3.0.beta2","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.6.0","1.6.0.beta","1.6.0.beta2","2.0.0","2.0.0.alpha","2.0.0.rc1","2.0.1","2.1.0","2.2.0","2.2.3","2.2.3.1","2.2.4","v2.2.1","v2.2.10","v2.2.11","v2.2.12","v2.2.13","v2.2.14","v2.2.15","v2.2.16","v2.2.17","v2.2.2","v2.2.5","v2.2.6","v2.2.6.1","v2.2.6.2","v2.2.6.3","v2.2.6.4","v2.2.7","v2.2.8","v2.2.8.1","v2.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59830.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/54e4ffdd5affebcb0c015cc6ae74635c0831ed71"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-625h-95r8-8xpm"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400","CWE-770"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
