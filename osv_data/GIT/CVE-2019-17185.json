This mean multiple threads use the same BN_CTX instance concurrently, resulting in crashes when concurrent EAP-pwd handshakes are initiated. This can be abused by an adversary as a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/freeradius/freeradius-server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d94c953ab9602a238433ba18533111b845fd8e9e"}]}],"versions":["branch_4_0_0","first-build","release_0_1_0","release_0_2_0","release_0_3_0","release_0_4_0","release_0_5_0","release_0_6_0","release_0_7_0","release_0_9_0","release_0_9_0_final","release_0_9_0_pre2","release_0_9_0_pre3","release_1_0_0","release_1_0_0_pre1","release_1_0_0_pre2","release_1_0_0_pre3","release_1_0_1","release_1_0_2","release_1_1_0","release_1_1_0_pre0","release_1_1_1","release_1_1_2","release_1_1_3","release_1_1_4","release_1_1_5","release_1_1_6","release_1_1_7","release_2_0_0","release_2_0_0_pre1","release_2_0_0_pre2","release_2_0_1","release_2_0_2","release_2_0_3","release_2_0_4","release_2_0_5","release_2_1_0","release_2_1_1","release_2_1_2","release_2_1_3","release_2_1_4","release_2_1_7","release_3.0.8","release_3_0_0","release_3_0_0_beta0","release_3_0_0_beta1","release_3_0_0_rc0","release_3_0_0_rc1","release_3_0_1","release_3_0_10","release_3_0_11","release_3_0_12","release_3_0_13","release_3_0_14","release_3_0_15","release_3_0_16","release_3_0_17","release_3_0_18","release_3_0_19","release_3_0_2","release_3_0_3","release_3_0_4_rc0","release_3_0_4_rc1","release_3_0_4_rc2","release_3_0_5","release_3_0_6","release_3_0_7","release_3_0_8","release_3_0_9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-17185.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-04/msg00039.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://freeradius.org/security/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/releases/tag/release_3_0_20"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
