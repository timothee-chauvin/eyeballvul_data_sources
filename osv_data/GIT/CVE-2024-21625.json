  "id": "CVE-2024-21625",
  "details": "SideQuest is a place to get virtual reality applications for Oculus Quest. The SideQuest desktop application uses deep links with a custom protocol (`sidequest://`) to trigger actions in the application from its web contents. Because, prior to version 0.10.35, the deep link URLs were not sanitized properly in all cases, a one-click remote code execution can be achieved in cases when a device is connected, the user is presented with a malicious link and clicks it from within the application. As of version 0.10.35, the custom protocol links within the electron application are now being parsed and sanitized properly.",
