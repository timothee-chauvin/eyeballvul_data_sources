When two or more cores observe that\nvma->numab_state is NULL at the same time, vma->numab_state will be\noverwritten.\n\nAlthough current code ensures that only one thread scans the VMAs in a\nsingle 'numa_scan_period', there might be a chance for another thread\nto enter in the next 'numa_scan_period' while we have not gotten till\nnumab_state allocation [1].\n\nNote that the command `/opt/ltp/testcases/bin/hackbench 50 process 1000`\ncannot the reproduce the issue. It is verified with 200+ test runs.\n\n[Solution]\nUse the cmpxchg atomic operation to ensure that only one thread executes\nthe vma->numab_state assignment.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1794be3c-358c-4cdc-a43d-a1f841d91ef7@amd.com/","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ef6a22b70f6d90449a5c797b8968a682824e2011"},{"fixed":"8f149bcc4d91ac92b32ff4949b291e6ed883dc42"},{"fixed":"a71ddd5b87cda687efa28e049e85e923689bcef9"},{"fixed":"5f1b64e9a9b7ee9cfd32c6b2fab796e29bfed075"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.13-rc1","v6.3","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.5","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.59","v6.6.6","v6.6.60","v6.6.61","v6.6.62","v6.6.63","v6.6.64","v6.6.65","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-56613.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.4.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.66"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-56613.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f1b64e9a9b7ee9cfd32c6b2fab796e29bfed075"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8f149bcc4d91ac92b32ff4949b291e6ed883dc42"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a71ddd5b87cda687efa28e049e85e923689bcef9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/56xxx/CVE-2024-56613.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56613"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/56xxx/CVE-2024-56613.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
