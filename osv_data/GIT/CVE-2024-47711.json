[0]\n\nThe scenario is\n\n  1. send(MSG_OOB)\n  2. recv(MSG_OOB)\n     -> The consumed OOB remains in recv queue\n  3. send(MSG_OOB)\n  4. recv()\n     -> manage_oob() returns the next skb of the consumed OOB\n     -> This is also OOB, but unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb is not cleared\n  5. recv(MSG_OOB)\n     -> unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb is used but already freed\n\nThe recent commit 8594d9b85c07 (\"af_unix: Don't call skb_get() for OOB\nskb.\") uncovered the issue.\n\nIf the OOB skb is consumed and the next skb is peeked in manage_oob(),\nwe still need to check if the skb is OOB.\n\nLet's do so by falling back to the following checks in manage_oob()\nand add the test case in selftest.\n\nNote that we need to add a similar check for SIOCATMARK.\n\n[0]:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in
