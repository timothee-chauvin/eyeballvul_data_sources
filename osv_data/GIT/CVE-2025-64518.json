{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-64518","published":"2025-11-10T22:08:06Z","modified":"2025-11-14T19:41:31.753802Z","aliases":["GHSA-6fhj-vr9j-g45r"],"summary":"CycloneDX Core (Java): BOM validation is vulnerable to XML External Entity injection","details":"The CycloneDX core module provides a model representation of the SBOM along with utilities to assist in creating, validating, and parsing SBOMs. Starting in version 2.1.0 and prior to version 11.0.1, the XML `Validator` used by cyclonedx-core-java was not configured securely, making the library vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. The fix for GHSA-683x-4444-jxh8 / CVE-2024-38374 was incomplete in that it only fixed parsing of XML BOMs, but not validation. The vulnerability has been fixed in cyclonedx-core-java version 11.0.1. As a workaround, applications can reject XML documents before handing them to cyclonedx-core-java for validation. This may be an option if incoming CycloneDX BOMs are known to be in JSON format.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cyclonedx/cyclonedx-core-java","events":[{"introduced":"b4da34451bbda7c0b08e48b8e4f8d709b5f9dd39"},{"fixed":"700ef747002ea0986e2a3a0f6adc6e560c48663a"}]}],"versions":["cyclonedx-core-java-10.0.0","cyclonedx-core-java-10.1.0","cyclonedx-core-java-10.2.0","cyclonedx-core-java-10.2.1","cyclonedx-core-java-11.0.0","cyclonedx-core-java-2.1.0","cyclonedx-core-java-2.1.1","cyclonedx-core-java-2.5.0","cyclonedx-core-java-2.5.1","cyclonedx-core-java-2.6.0","cyclonedx-core-java-2.6.1","cyclonedx-core-java-2.6.2","cyclonedx-core-java-2.6.3","cyclonedx-core-java-2.6.4","cyclonedx-core-java-2.6.5","cyclonedx-core-java-2.7.0","cyclonedx-core-java-3.0.0","cyclonedx-core-java-3.0.1","cyclonedx-core-java-3.0.2","cyclonedx-core-java-3.0.3","cyclonedx-core-java-3.0.4","cyclonedx-core-java-3.0.5","cyclonedx-core-java-3.0.6","cyclonedx-core-java-3.0.7","cyclonedx-core-java-3.0.8","cyclonedx-core-java-4.0.0","cyclonedx-core-java-4.0.1","cyclonedx-core-java-4.0.2","cyclonedx-core-java-4.0.3","cyclonedx-core-java-4.1.0","cyclonedx-core-java-4.1.1","cyclonedx-core-java-4.1.2","cyclonedx-core-java-5.0.0","cyclonedx-core-java-5.0.1","cyclonedx-core-java-5.0.2","cyclonedx-core-java-5.0.3","cyclonedx-core-java-5.0.4","cyclonedx-core-java-5.0.5","cyclonedx-core-java-6.0.0","cyclonedx-core-java-7.0.0","cyclonedx-core-java-7.1.0","cyclonedx-core-java-7.1.1","cyclonedx-core-java-7.1.2","cyclonedx-core-java-7.1.3","cyclonedx-core-java-7.1.4","cyclonedx-core-java-7.1.5","cyclonedx-core-java-7.1.6","cyclonedx-core-java-7.2.0","cyclonedx-core-java-7.2.1","cyclonedx-core-java-7.3.0","cyclonedx-core-java-7.3.1","cyclonedx-core-java-7.3.2","cyclonedx-core-java-8.0.0","cyclonedx-core-java-8.0.1","cyclonedx-core-java-8.0.2","cyclonedx-core-java-8.0.3","cyclonedx-core-java-9.0.0","cyclonedx-core-java-9.0.1","cyclonedx-core-java-9.0.2","cyclonedx-core-java-9.0.3","cyclonedx-core-java-9.0.4","cyclonedx-core-java-9.0.5","cyclonedx-core-java-9.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-64518.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#schemafactory"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/commit/162aa594f347b3f612fe0a45071693c3cd398ce9"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/commit/af0ec75c93c03f93733a070c5132554490af5314"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/pull/737"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/security/advisories/GHSA-6fhj-vr9j-g45r"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-611"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
