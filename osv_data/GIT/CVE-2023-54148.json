If there is a encap rule\noffloaded in ECMP mode, when one eswitch does unpair (because of\nunloading the driver, for instance), and the peer rule from the peer\neswitch is going to be deleted, the use-after-free error is triggered\nwhile accessing neigh info, as it is already cleaned up in uplink's\nprofile->disable, which is before its profile->cleanup_tx.\n\nTo fix this issue, move the neigh cleanup to profile's cleanup_tx\ncallback, and after mlx5e_cleanup_uplink_rep_tx is called. The neigh\ninit is moved to init_tx for symmeter.\n\n[ 2453.376299] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in mlx5e_rep_neigh_entry_release+0x109/0x3a0 [mlx5_core]\n[ 2453.379125] Read of size 4 at addr
