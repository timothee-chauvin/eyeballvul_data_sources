{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-29910","published":"2025-03-17T22:04:34.724Z","modified":"2025-11-20T07:56:14.916193Z","aliases":["GHSA-p38w-p2r8-g6g5"],"summary":"CryptoLib's crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter Function has Memory Leak","details":"CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. A memory leak vulnerability was identified in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability can lead to resource exhaustion and degraded system performance over time, particularly in long-running processes or systems processing large volumes of data. The vulnerability is present in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function within `crypto_tc.c`. The function allocates memory using `malloc` without ensuring the allocated memory is always freed. This issue can lead to resource exhaustion, reduced system performance, and potentially a Denial of Service (DoS) in environments where CryptoLib is used in long-running processes or with large volumes of data. Any system using CryptoLib, especially those handling high-throughput or continuous data streams, could be impacted. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nasa/cryptolib","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"c09fdc2b3207a93c401c6344ad5363e8d585a817"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.3.3"}]}}],"versions":["v0.1-engineering-release","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-29910.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-p38w-p2r8-g6g5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-401"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
