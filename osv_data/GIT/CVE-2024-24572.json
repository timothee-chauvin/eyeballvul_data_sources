In versions 4.5.0 and earlier, the $_REQUEST global array was unsafely called inside an extract() function in admin-logs.php. The PHP file fm-init.php prevents arbitrary manipulation of $_SESSION via the GET/POST parameters. However, it does not prevent manipulation of any other sensitive variables such as $search_sql. Knowing this, an authenticated user with privileges to view site logs can manipulate the search_sql\nvariable by appending a GET parameter search_sql in the URL. The information above means that the checks and SQL injection prevention attempts were rendered unusable.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/willyxj/facilemanager","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"5613baa626b3bf0ce81601c3745031922f9b6ce3"}]}],"versions":["facileManager-complete-3.4.1","v2.3.3-complete","v3.0-complete","v3.0.1-complete","v3.0.3-complete","v3.1-complete","v3.2-complete","v3.3-complete","v3.4-complete","v3.5.2-complete","v4.0.0-complete","v4.2.0-complete","v4.5.0-complete"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-24572.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/WillyXJ/facileManager/security/advisories/GHSA-xw34-8pj6-75gc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/WillyXJ/facileManager/commit/0aa850d4b518f10143a4c675142b15caa5872877"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-89"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
