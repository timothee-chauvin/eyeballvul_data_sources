{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-34706","published":"2024-05-13T16:02:28Z","modified":"2025-11-11T02:34:59Z","aliases":["GHSA-xcp4-62vj-cq3r"],"summary":"@valtimo/components exposes access token to form.io","details":"Valtimo is an open source business process and case management platform. When opening a form in Valtimo, the access token (JWT) of the user is exposed to `api.form.io` via the the `x-jwt-token` header. An attacker can retrieve personal information from this token, or use it to execute requests to the Valtimo REST API on behalf of the logged-in user. This issue is caused by a misconfiguration of the Form.io component.\n\nThe following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack: An attacker needs to have access to the network traffic on the `api.form.io` domain; the content of the `x-jwt-token` header is logged or otherwise available to the attacker; an attacker needs to have network access to the Valtimo API; and an attacker needs to act within the time-to-live of the access token. The default TTL in Keycloak is 5 minutes.\n\nVersions 10.8.4, 11.1.6 and 11.2.2 have been patched.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d65e05fd2784bd4a628778b34a5b79ce2f0cef8c"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-34706.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries/commit/1aaba5ef5750dafebbc7476fb08bf2375a25f19e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries/commit/8c2dbf2a41180d2b0358d878290e4d37168f0fb6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries/commit/d65e05fd2784bd4a628778b34a5b79ce2f0cef8c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-frontend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-xcp4-62vj-cq3r"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-532"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
