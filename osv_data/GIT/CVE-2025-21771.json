{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-21771","published":"2025-02-27T02:18:19Z","modified":"2025-10-22T09:19:53.902076Z","summary":"sched_ext: Fix incorrect autogroup migration detection","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched_ext: Fix incorrect autogroup migration detection\n\nscx_move_task() is called from sched_move_task() and tells the BPF scheduler\nthat cgroup migration is being committed. sched_move_task() is used by both\ncgroup and autogroup migrations and scx_move_task() tried to filter out\nautogroup migrations by testing the destination cgroup and PF_EXITING but\nthis is not enough. In fact, without explicitly tagging the thread which is\ndoing the cgroup migration, there is no good way to tell apart\nscx_move_task() invocations for racing migration to the root cgroup and an\nautogroup migration.\n\nThis led to scx_move_task() incorrectly ignoring a migration from non-root\ncgroup to an autogroup of the root cgroup triggering the following warning:\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 1 at kernel/sched/ext.c:3725 scx_cgroup_can_attach+0x196/0x340\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n    cgroup_migrate_execute+0x5b1/0x700\n    cgroup_attach_task+0x296/0x400\n    __cgroup_procs_write+0x128/0x140\n    cgroup_procs_write+0x17/0x30\n    kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x141/0x1f0\n    vfs_write+0x31d/0x4a0\n    __x64_sys_write+0x72/0xf0\n    do_syscall_64+0x82/0x160\n    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n\nFix it by adding an argument to sched_move_task() that indicates whether the\nmoving is for a cgroup or autogroup migration. After the change,\nscx_move_task() is called only for cgroup migrations and renamed to\nscx_cgroup_move_task().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"8195136669661fdfe54e9a8923c33b31c92fc1da"},{"fixed":"75bf2f80c046d2ec5a07455891ea0a9fb6d8b5f6"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"8195136669661fdfe54e9a8923c33b31c92fc1da"},{"fixed":"d8b510d0ddc65d8a71e0f9a3acc9ed5f010fc514"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"8195136669661fdfe54e9a8923c33b31c92fc1da"},{"fixed":"d6f3e7d564b2309e1f17e709a70eca78d7ca2bb8"}]}],"versions":["v6.11","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.13.1","v6.13.2","v6.13.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21771.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.16"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.13.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-21771.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/75bf2f80c046d2ec5a07455891ea0a9fb6d8b5f6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d6f3e7d564b2309e1f17e709a70eca78d7ca2bb8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d8b510d0ddc65d8a71e0f9a3acc9ed5f010fc514"}]}
