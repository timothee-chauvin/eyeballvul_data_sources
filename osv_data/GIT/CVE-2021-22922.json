In a serial orparallel manner.If one of the servers hosting the contents has been breached and the contentsof the specific file on that server is replaced with a modified payload, curlshould detect this when the hash of the file mismatches after a completeddownload. It should remove the contents and instead try getting the contentsfrom another URL. This is not done, and instead such a hash mismatch is onlymentioned in text and the potentially malicious content is kept in the file ondisk.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/curl/curl","events":[{"introduced":"11a7ac0d6a84290001a5239df37bbca4270b17d4"},{"fixed":"bfbde883af33397943df68a3ae01847a634d33bf"}]}],"versions":["curl-7_27_0","curl-7_28_0","curl-7_28_1","curl-7_29_0","curl-7_30_0","curl-7_31_0","curl-7_32_0","curl-7_33_0","curl-7_34_0","curl-7_35_0","curl-7_36_0","curl-7_37_0","curl-7_37_1","curl-7_38_0","curl-7_39_0","curl-7_40_0","curl-7_41_0","curl-7_42_0","curl-7_43_0","curl-7_44_0","curl-7_45_0","curl-7_46_0","curl-7_47_0","curl-7_47_1","curl-7_48_0","curl-7_49_0","curl-7_49_1","curl-7_50_0","curl-7_50_1","curl-7_50_2","curl-7_50_3","curl-7_51_0","curl-7_52_0","curl-7_52_1","curl-7_53_0","curl-7_53_1","curl-7_54_0","curl-7_54_1","curl-7_55_0","curl-7_55_1","curl-7_56_0","curl-7_56_1","curl-7_57_0","curl-7_58_0","curl-7_59_0","curl-7_60_0","curl-7_61_0","curl-7_61_1","curl-7_62_0","curl-7_63_0","curl-7_64_0","curl-7_64_1","curl-7_65_0","curl-7_65_1","curl-7_65_2","curl-7_65_3","curl-7_66_0","curl-7_67_0","curl-7_68_0","curl-7_69_0","curl-7_69_1","curl-7_70_0","curl-7_71_0","curl-7_71_1","curl-7_72_0","curl-7_73_0","curl-7_74_0","curl-7_75_0","curl-7_76_0","curl-7_76_1","curl-7_77_0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-22922.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1213175"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r61db8e7dcb56dc000a5387a88f7a473bacec5ee01b9ff3f55308aacc%40%3Cdev.kafka.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r61db8e7dcb56dc000a5387a88f7a473bacec5ee01b9ff3f55308aacc%40%3Cusers.kafka.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbf4ce74b0d1fa9810dec50ba3ace0caeea677af7c27a97111c06ccb7%40%3Cdev.kafka.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbf4ce74b0d1fa9810dec50ba3ace0caeea677af7c27a97111c06ccb7%40%3Cusers.kafka.apache.org%3E"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FRUCW2UVNYUDZF72DQLFQR4PJEC6CF7V/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202212-01"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210902-0003/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
