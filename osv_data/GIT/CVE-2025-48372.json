{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-48372","published":"2025-05-22T20:38:02Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:47:11.091043Z","aliases":["GHSA-6c48-67xx-vqgc"],"summary":"Schule Has Insecure OTP Length, is Susceptible to Brute-Force Attacks","details":"Schule is open-source school management system software. The generateOTP() function generates a 4-digit numeric One-Time Password (OTP). Prior to version 1.0.1, even if a secure random number generator is used, the short length and limited range (1000â€“9999) results in only 9000 possible combinations. This small keyspace makes the OTP highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks, especially in the absence of strong rate-limiting or lockout mechanisms. Version 1.0.1 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/schule111/schule","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"cd53abbea93943f2c60a5281d45bebadc57636b7"}]}],"versions":["school","schools"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-48372.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/schule111/Schule/security/advisories/GHSA-6c48-67xx-vqgc"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/schule111/Schule/commit/cd53abbea93943f2c60a5281d45bebadc57636b7"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-521"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
