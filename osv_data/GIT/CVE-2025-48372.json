  "details": "Schule is open-source school management system software. The generateOTP() function generates a 4-digit numeric One-Time Password (OTP). Prior to version 1.0.1, even if a secure random number generator is used, the short length and limited range (1000\u20139999) results in only 9000 possible combinations. This small keyspace makes the OTP highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks, especially in the absence of strong rate-limiting or lockout mechanisms. Version 1.0.1 fixes the issue.",
