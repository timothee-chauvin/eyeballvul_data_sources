Starting in version 0.39.0 and prior to version 0.49.1 , an unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted HTTP Range header that triggers quadratic-time processing in Starlette's FileResponse Range parsing/merging logic. This enables CPU exhaustion per request, causing denial‑of‑service for endpoints serving files (e.g., StaticFiles or any use of FileResponse). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.49.1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/kludex/starlette","events":[{"introduced":"65bfd74307f593505aaa4c399f73e4d90cd8aa78"},{"fixed":"7e4b7428f273dbdc875dcd036d20804bcfc7b2ee"}]}],"versions":["0.39.0","0.39.1","0.39.2","0.40.0","0.41.0","0.41.1","0.41.2","0.41.3","0.42.0","0.43.0","0.44.0","0.45.0","0.45.1","0.45.2","0.45.3","0.46.0","0.46.1","0.46.2","0.47.0","0.47.1","0.47.2","0.47.3","0.48.0","0.49.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62727.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Kludex/starlette/commit/4ea6e22b489ec388d6004cfbca52dd5b147127c5"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/Kludex/starlette/commit/69ed26a85956ef4bd0161807eb27abf49be7cd3c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Kludex/starlette/releases/tag/0.49.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Kludex/starlette/security/advisories/GHSA-7f5h-v6xp-fcq8"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-407"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
