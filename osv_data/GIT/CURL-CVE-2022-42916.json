  "summary": "HSTS bypass via IDN",
  "details": "curl's HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it to keep using HTTP.\n\nUsing its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS directly instead\nof using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the\nURL. This mechanism could be bypassed if the hostname in the given URL uses\nIDN characters that get replaced to ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN\nconversion. Like using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (`IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP`)\ninstead of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E) `.`.\n\nLike this: `http://curl\u3002se\u3002`",
