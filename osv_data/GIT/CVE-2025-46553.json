Starting in version 3.0.1 and prior to version 5.2.1, a logic error in the main `summaly` function causes the `allowRedirects` option to never be passed to any plugins, and as a result, isn't enforced. Misskey will follow redirects, despite explicitly requesting not to. Version 5.2.1 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/misskey-dev/summaly","events":[{"introduced":"3c7c3c8aa715bc2fd79c319af226c0e923ce29b4"},{"fixed":"56e1137113846edd1ef8ea961a7e3333900ad891"}]}],"versions":["5.0.0","5.0.1","5.0.2","5.0.3","5.1.0","5.2.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v4.0.0","v4.0.1","v4.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-46553.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/misskey-dev/summaly/security/advisories/GHSA-7899-w6c4-vqc4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/misskey-dev/summaly/commit/45153b4f08a772c395a13f7a25399dd87ed022ed"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601","CWE-665","CWE-669","CWE-693"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}]}
