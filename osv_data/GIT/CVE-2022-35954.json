The `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known delimiter that attackers can use to break out of that specific variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. Workflows that write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file may cause the path or other environment variables to be modified without the intention of the workflow or action author. Users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.9.1`. If you are unable to upgrade the `@actions/core` package, you can modify your action to ensure that any user input does not contain the delimiter `_GitHubActionsFileCommandDelimeter_` before calling `core.exportVariable`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/actions/toolkit","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4beda9cbc00ba6eefe387a937c21087ccb8ee9df"}]}],"versions":["0.0.0","0.0.1","0.0.2","@actions/core@1.0.0","@actions/core@1.1.0","@actions/exec@1.0.0","@actions/exec@1.0.1","@actions/github@1.0.0","@actions/github@1.1.0","@actions/io@1.0.0","@actions/io@1.0.1","@actions/tool-cache@1.0.0","@actions/tool-cache@1.1.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35954.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/commit/4beda9cbc00ba6eefe387a937c21087ccb8ee9df"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/security/advisories/GHSA-7r3h-m5j6-3q42"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-77"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
