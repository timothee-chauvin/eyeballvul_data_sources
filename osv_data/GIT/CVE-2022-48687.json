This configuration is realised via netlink through\nfour attributes: SEG6_ATTR_HMACKEYID, SEG6_ATTR_SECRET, SEG6_ATTR_SECRETLEN and\nSEG6_ATTR_ALGID. Because the SECRETLEN attribute is decoupled from the actual\nlength of the SECRET attribute, it is possible to provide invalid combinations\n(e.g., secret = \"\", secretlen = 64). This case is not checked in the code and\nwith an appropriately crafted netlink message, an out-of-bounds read of up\nto 64 bytes (max secret length) can occur past the skb end pointer and into\nskb_shared_info:\n\nBreakpoint 1, seg6_genl_sethmac (skb=<optimized out>, info=<optimized out>) at net/ipv6/seg6.c:208\n208\t\tmemcpy(hinfo->secret, secret, slen);\n(gdb) bt\n #0  seg6_genl_sethmac (skb=<optimized out>, info=<optimized out>) at net/ipv6/seg6.c:208\n #1  0xffffffff81e012e9 in genl_family_rcv_msg_doit (skb=skb@entry=0xffff88800b1f9f00, nlh=nlh@entry=0xffff88800b1b7600,\n    extack=extack@entry=0xffffc90000ba7af0, ops=ops@entry=0xffffc90000ba7a80, hdrlen=4, net=0xffffffff84237580 <init_net>, family=<optimized out>,\n    family=<optimized out>) at net/netlink/genetlink.c:731\n #2  0xffffffff81e01435 in genl_family_rcv_msg (extack=0xffffc90000ba7af0, nlh=0xffff88800b1b7600, skb=0xffff88800b1f9f00,\n    family=0xffffffff82fef6c0 <seg6_genl_family>) at net/netlink/genetlink.c:775\n #3  genl_rcv_msg (skb=0xffff88800b1f9f00, nlh=0xffff88800b1b7600, extack=0xffffc90000ba7af0) at net/netlink/genetlink.c:792\n #4  0xffffffff81dfffc3 in netlink_rcv_skb (skb=skb@entry=0xffff88800b1f9f00, cb=cb@entry=0xffffffff81e01350 <genl_rcv_msg>)\n    at net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2501\n #5  0xffffffff81e00919 in genl_rcv (skb=0xffff88800b1f9f00) at net/netlink/genetlink.c:803\n #6  0xffffffff81dff6ae in netlink_unicast_kernel (ssk=0xffff888010eec800, skb=0xffff88800b1f9f00, sk=0xffff888004aed000)\n    at net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1319\n #7  netlink_unicast (ssk=ssk@entry=0xffff888010eec800, skb=skb@entry=0xffff88800b1f9f00, portid=portid@entry=0, nonblock=<optimized out>)\n    at net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1345\n #8  0xffffffff81dff9a4 in netlink_sendmsg (sock=<optimized out>, msg=0xffffc90000ba7e48, len=<optimized out>) at net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1921\n...\n(gdb) p/x ((struct sk_buff *)0xffff88800b1f9f00)->head + ((struct sk_buff *)0xffff88800b1f9f00)->end\n$1 = 0xffff88800b1b76c0\n(gdb) p/x secret\n$2 = 0xffff88800b1b76c0\n(gdb) p slen\n$3 = 64 '@'\n\nThe OOB data can then be read back from userspace by dumping HMAC state.
