This will lead to infinite readdir combine with rename\nhappened at the same time, which fail generic/736 in xfstests(detail show\nas below).\n\n1. create 5000 files(1 2 3...) under one dir\n2. call readdir(man 3 readdir) once, and get one entry\n3. rename(entry, \"TEMPFILE\"), then rename(\"TEMPFILE\", entry)\n4. loop 2~3, until readdir return nothing or we loop too many\n   times(tmpfs break test with the second condition)\n\nWe choose the same logic what commit 9b378f6ad48cf (\"btrfs: fix infinite\ndirectory reads\") to fix it, record the last_index when we open dir, and\ndo not emit the entry which index >= last_index. The file->private_data\nnow used in offset dir can use directly to do this, and we also update\nthe last_index when we llseek the dir file.\n\n[brauner: only update last_index after seek when offset is zero like Jan suggested]","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a2e459555c5f9da3e619b7e47a63f98574dc75f1"},{"fixed":"308b4fc2403b335894592ee9dc212a5e58bb309f"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a2e459555c5f9da3e619b7e47a63f98574dc75f1"},{"fixed":"64a7ce76fb901bf9f9c36cf5d681328fc0fd4b5a"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.10.1","v6.10.2","v6.10.3","v6.10.4","v6.10.5","v6.10.6","v6.11-rc1","v6.5","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-46701.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.6.0"},{"fixed":"6.10.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-46701.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/308b4fc2403b335894592ee9dc212a5e58bb309f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/64a7ce76fb901bf9f9c36cf5d681328fc0fd4b5a"}]}
