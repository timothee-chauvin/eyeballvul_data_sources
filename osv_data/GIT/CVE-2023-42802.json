Starting in version 10.0.7 and prior to version 10.0.10, an unverified object instantiation allows one to upload malicious PHP files to unwanted directories. Depending on web server configuration and available system libraries, malicious PHP files can then be executed through a web server request. Version 10.0.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, remove write access on `/ajax` and `/front` files to the web server.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi","events":[{"introduced":"bce21331d50a020cd0928178a68fe4aac2cc50b4"},{"fixed":"0c860f018f5bd0f08b87d217a376304e62a5ba58"}]}],"versions":["10.0.7","10.0.8","10.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-42802.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/security/advisories/GHSA-rrh2-x4ch-pq3m"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/releases/tag/10.0.10"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
