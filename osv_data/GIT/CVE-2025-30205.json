Prior to version 1.2.0, a faulty function intrumentation in the (optional) kanidm patches provided by kandim-provision will cause the provisioned admin credentials to be leaked to the system log. This only impacts users which both use the provided patches and provision their `admin` or `idm_admin` account credentials this way. No other credentials are affected. Users should recompile kanidm with the newest patchset from tag `v1.2.0` or higher. As a workaround, the user can set the log level `KANIDM_LOG_LEVEL` to any level higher than `info`, for example `warn`.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/oddlama/kanidm-provision","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a102b52e4a79be4263068577ba837f16c3e487a2"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-30205.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/oddlama/kanidm-provision/commit/a102b52e4a79be4263068577ba837f16c3e487a2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/oddlama/kanidm-provision/security/advisories/GHSA-57fc-pcqm-53rp"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-532"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N"}]}
