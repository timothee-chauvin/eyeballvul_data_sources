{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-50579","published":"2025-10-22T13:23:32Z","modified":"2025-10-22T22:29:11.867306Z","summary":"arm64: ftrace: fix module PLTs with mcount","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: ftrace: fix module PLTs with mcount\n\nLi Huafei reports that mcount-based ftrace with module PLTs was broken\nby commit:\n\n  a6253579977e4c6f (\"arm64: ftrace: consistently handle PLTs.\")\n\nWhen a module PLTs are used and a module is loaded sufficiently far away\nfrom the kernel, we'll create PLTs for any branches which are\nout-of-range. These are separate from the special ftrace trampoline\nPLTs, which the module PLT code doesn't directly manipulate.\n\nWhen mcount is in use this is a problem, as each mcount callsite in a\nmodule will be initialized to point to a module PLT, but since commit\na6253579977e4c6f ftrace_make_nop() will assume that the callsite has\nbeen initialized to point to the special ftrace trampoline PLT, and\nftrace_find_callable_addr() rejects other cases.\n\nThis means that when ftrace tries to initialize a callsite via\nftrace_make_nop(), the call to ftrace_find_callable_addr() will find\nthat the `_mcount` stub is out-of-range and is not handled by the ftrace\nPLT, resulting in a splat:\n\n| ftrace_test: loading out-of-tree module taints kernel.\n| ftrace: no module PLT for _mcount\n|
