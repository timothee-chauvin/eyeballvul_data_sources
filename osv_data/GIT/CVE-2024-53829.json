The attacker needs to know the ID of the available products to modify or delete them. The attacker cannot directly exfiltrate data (view) from CodeChecker, due to being limited to form-based CSRF.\n\nThis issue affects CodeChecker: through 6.24.4.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ericsson/codechecker","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"454d978191ed42c8202a2244dc092dfb6fd8c83a"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-53829.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Ericsson/codechecker/security/advisories/GHSA-f8c8-4pm7-w885"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N"}]}
