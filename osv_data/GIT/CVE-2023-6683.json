The qemu_clipboard_request() function can be reached before vnc_server_cut_text_caps() was called and had the chance to initialize the clipboard peer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. This could allow a malicious authenticated VNC client to crash QEMU and trigger a denial of service.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/qemu/qemu","events":[{"introduced":"f9baca549e44791be0dd98de15add3d8452a8af0"},{"fixed":"11aa0b1ff115b86160c4d37e7c37e6a6b13b77ea"}]}],"versions":["v6.1.0","v6.2.0","v6.2.0-rc0","v6.2.0-rc1","v6.2.0-rc3","v6.2.0-rc4","v7.0.0","v7.0.0-rc0","v7.0.0-rc1","v7.0.0-rc2","v7.0.0-rc3","v7.0.0-rc4","v7.1.0","v7.1.0-rc0","v7.1.0-rc1","v7.1.0-rc2","v7.1.0-rc3","v7.1.0-rc4","v7.2.0","v7.2.0-rc0","v7.2.0-rc1","v7.2.0-rc2","v7.2.0-rc3","v7.2.0-rc4","v8.0.0","v8.0.0-rc0","v8.0.0-rc1","v8.0.0-rc2","v8.0.0-rc3","v8.0.0-rc4","v8.1.0","v8.1.0-rc0","v8.1.0-rc1","v8.1.0-rc2","v8.1.0-rc3","v8.1.0-rc4","v8.2.0","v8.2.0-rc0","v8.2.0-rc1","v8.2.0-rc2","v8.2.0-rc3","v8.2.0-rc4","v8.2.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-6683.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2135"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2962"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6683"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240223-0001/"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2254825"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
