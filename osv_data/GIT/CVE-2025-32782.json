{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-32782","published":"2025-04-15T22:04:41.667Z","modified":"2025-12-05T08:54:51.976126Z","aliases":["GHSA-3988-q8q7-p787"],"summary":"Ash Authentication email link auto-click account confirmation vulnerability","details":"Ash Authentication provides authentication for the Ash framework. The confirmation flow for account creation currently uses a GET request triggered by clicking a link sent via email. Some email clients and security tools (e.g., Outlook, virus scanners, and email previewers) may automatically follow these links, unintentionally confirming the account. This allows an attacker to register an account using another user’s email and potentially have it auto-confirmed by the victim’s email client. This does not allow attackers to take over or access existing accounts or private data. It is limited to account confirmation of new accounts only. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.7.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"d9b0ca8fc1dac3c72d84536dc673f2b495eea1b2"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.4.1","v0.4.2","v0.4.3","v0.5.0","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v1.0.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.2","v3.0.3","v3.0.4","v3.1.0","v3.10.0","v3.10.1","v3.10.2","v3.10.4","v3.10.5","v3.10.6","v3.10.7","v3.10.8","v3.11.0","v3.11.1","v3.11.10","v3.11.12","v3.11.13","v3.11.14","v3.11.15","v3.11.16","v3.11.2","v3.11.3","v3.11.4","v3.11.5","v3.11.6","v3.11.7","v3.11.8","v3.11.9","v3.12.0","v3.12.1","v3.12.2","v3.12.3","v3.12.4","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.2","v3.3.0","v3.3.1","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.4.2","v3.5.0","v3.5.1","v3.5.2","v3.5.3","v3.6.1","v3.7.0","v3.7.1","v3.7.2","v3.7.3","v3.7.4","v3.7.5","v3.7.6","v3.7.8","v3.7.9","v3.9.0","v3.9.2","v3.9.3","v3.9.4","v3.9.5","v3.9.6","v4.0.0","v4.0.0-rc.0","v4.0.0-rc.1","v4.0.0-rc.2","v4.0.0-rc.3","v4.0.0-rc.4","v4.0.0-rc.5","v4.0.0-rc.6","v4.0.0-rc.7","v4.0.1","v4.0.2","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.1.0","v4.2.0","v4.2.1","v4.2.2","v4.2.3","v4.2.5","v4.2.7","v4.3.0","v4.3.1","v4.3.10","v4.3.12","v4.3.2","v4.3.3","v4.3.4","v4.3.6","v4.3.7","v4.3.9","v4.4.0","v4.4.1","v4.4.2","v4.4.3","v4.4.4","v4.4.5","v4.4.6","v4.4.7","v4.4.8","v4.4.9","v4.5.1","v4.5.2","v4.5.3","v4.5.4","v4.5.5","v4.5.6","v4.6.0","v4.6.1","v4.6.2","v4.6.3","v4.6.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-32782.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/32xxx/CVE-2025-32782.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication/commit/99ea38977fd4f421d2aaae0c2fb29f8e5f8f707d"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication/security/advisories/GHSA-3988-q8q7-p787"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32782"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-306"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/32xxx/CVE-2025-32782.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
