The queue is merely frozen in this\ncontext, but that only prevents requests from allocating and doesn't\nstop the hctx work from running. The work may get an elevator pointer\nthat's being torn down, and can result in use-after-free errors and\nkernel panics (example below). Use the quiesced elevator switch instead,\nand make the previous one static since it is now only used locally.\n\n  nvme nvme0: resetting controller\n  nvme nvme0: 32/0/0 default/read/poll queues\n
