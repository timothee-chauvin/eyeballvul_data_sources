{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-65442","published":"2025-12-29T15:16:01.637Z","modified":"2026-01-03T05:45:21.770846Z","details":"DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in 201206030 novel V3.5.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code or disclose sensitive information (e.g., user session cookies) via a crafted \"wvstest\" parameter in the URL or malicious script injection into window.localStorage. The vulnerability arises from insufficient validation and encoding of user-controllable data in the book comment module: unfiltered user input is stored in the backend database (book_comment table, commentContent field) and returned via API, then rendered directly into the page DOM via Vue 3's v-html directive without sanitization. Even if modern browsers' built-in XSS filters block pop-up alerts, attackers can use concealed payloads to bypass interception and achieve actual harm.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/201206030/novel","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"b2c034004883a9f3c69f8da4689d897cb054491a"}]}],"versions":["v3.0.0","v3.1.0.RELEASE","v3.2.0.RELEASE","v3.3.0.RELEASE","v3.4.0","v3.4.1","v3.5.0-SNAPSHOT"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65442.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/zero-day348/DOM-based-Cross-Site-Scripting-XSS-Vulnerability-in-novel-V3.5.0-CWE-79-"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/201206030/novel"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/201206030/novel-front-web"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
