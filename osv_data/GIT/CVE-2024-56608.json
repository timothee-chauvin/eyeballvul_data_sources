This array has a fixed size\nand the index was not being checked against the array's bounds before\naccessing it.\n\nThis fix adds a conditional check to ensure that the hpd_source index is\nwithin the valid range of the link_enc_hpd_regs array. If the index is\nout of bounds, the function now returns NULL to prevent undefined\nbehavior.\n\nReferences:\n\n[   65.920507] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[   65.920510] UBSAN:
