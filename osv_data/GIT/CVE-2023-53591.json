Due to peer flows offload implementation\nthe lock is taken much higher up the call chain and there is no obvious way\nto easily fix the deadlock. Instead, since tc route query code needs the\npeer eswitch structure only to perform a lookup in xarray and doesn't\nperform any sleeping operations with it, refactor the code for lockless\nexecution in following ways:\n\n- RCUify the devcom 'data' pointer. When resetting the pointer\nsynchronously wait for RCU grace period before returning. This is fine\nsince devcom is currently only used for synchronization of\npairing/unpairing of eswitches which is rare and already expensive as-is.\n\n- Wrap all usages of 'paired' boolean in {READ|WRITE}_ONCE(). The flag has\nalready been used in some unlocked contexts without proper\nannotations (e.g. users of mlx5_devcom_is_paired() function), but it wasn't\nan issue since all relevant code paths checked it again after obtaining the\ndevcom semaphore. Now it is also used by mlx5_devcom_get_peer_data_rcu() as\n\"best effort\" check to return NULL when devcom is being unpaired. Note that\nwhile RCU read lock doesn't prevent the unpaired flag from being changed\nconcurrently it still guarantees that reader can continue to use 'data'.\n\n- Refactor mlx5e_tc_query_route_vport() function to use new\nmlx5_devcom_get_peer_data_rcu() API which fixes the deadlock.\n\n[0]:\n\n[  164.599612] ======================================================\n[  164.600142] WARNING: possible
