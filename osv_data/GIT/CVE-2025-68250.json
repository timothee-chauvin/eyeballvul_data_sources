This breaks the\nassumption and causes two related WARN_ON_ONCE checks to trigger.\n\nTo fix this, the runtime checks are adjusted to silently ignore any lock\nthat is not 4-byte aligned, effectively disabling the feature in such\ncases and avoiding the related warnings.\n\nThanks to Geert Uytterhoeven for bisecting!","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"e711faaafbe54a884f33b53472434063d342f6d4"},{"fixed":"c0e2dcbe54cb15ecdf9d8f4501c6720423243888"},{"fixed":"c97513cddcfc235f2522617980838e500af21d01"}]}],"versions":["v6.15","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.18-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68250.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68250.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c0e2dcbe54cb15ecdf9d8f4501c6720423243888"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c97513cddcfc235f2522617980838e500af21d01"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68250.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68250"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68250.json"}}
