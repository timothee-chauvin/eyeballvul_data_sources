{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2017-8295","published":"2017-05-04T14:29:00.200Z","modified":"2025-11-29T18:04:56.755059Z","details":"WordPress through 4.7.4 relies on the Host HTTP header for a password-reset e-mail message, which makes it easier for remote attackers to reset arbitrary passwords by making a crafted wp-login.php?action=lostpassword request and then arranging for this message to bounce or be resent, leading to transmission of the reset key to a mailbox on an attacker-controlled SMTP server. This is related to problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variable in wp-includes/pluggable.php in conjunction with the PHP mail function. Exploitation is not achievable in all cases because it requires at least one of the following: (1) the attacker can prevent the victim from receiving any e-mail messages for an extended period of time (such as 5 days), (2) the victim's e-mail system sends an autoresponse containing the original message, or (3) the victim manually composes a reply containing the original message.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2152a6a1ea3db59fcc626fe8129d6fc175e0df66"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-8295.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress-develop","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1d924259d53f10bfd96338819101427edc28a47e"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2017-8295.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038403"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/8807"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3870"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98295"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-7-Unauth-Password-Reset-0day-CVE-2017-8295.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41963/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}]}
