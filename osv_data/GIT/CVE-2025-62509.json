{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-62509","published":"2025-10-20T17:38:49Z","modified":"2025-10-23T05:16:35.195420Z","aliases":["GHSA-6p87-q9rh-95wh"],"summary":"FileRise improper ownership/permission validation allowed cross-tenant file operations","details":"FileRise is a self-hosted web-based file manager with multi-file upload, editing, and batch operations. Prior to version 1.4.0, a business logic flaw in FileRiseâ€™s file/folder handling allows low-privilege users to perform unauthorized operations (view/delete/modify) on files created by other users. The root cause was inferring ownership/visibility from folder names (e.g., a folder named after a username) and missing server-side authorization/ownership checks across file operation endpoints. This amounted to an IDOR pattern: an attacker could operate on resources identified only by predictable names. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.0 and further hardened in version 1.5.0. A workaround for this issue involves restricting non-admin users to read-only or disable delete/rename APIs server-side, avoid creating top-level folders named after other usernames, and adding server-side checks that verify ownership before delete/rename/move.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/error311/filerise","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"25ce6a76beb60950359c0304765ad91a8aff8ad8"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2","v1.0.3","v1.0.4","v1.0.5","v1.0.6","v1.0.7","v1.0.8","v1.0.9","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.13","v1.3.15","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.3.6","v1.3.7","v1.3.8","v1.3.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62509.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/error311/FileRise/security/advisories/GHSA-6p87-q9rh-95wh"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/error311/FileRise/commit/25ce6a76beb60950359c0304765ad91a8aff8ad8"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/error311/FileRise/issues/53"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-280","CWE-284"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
