In affected versions a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability exists in \"Upload from URL\" and remote attachment handling. This could result in the disclosure of non-public information within the internal network. This has been fixed in 12.90.0. However, if you are using a proxy, you will need to take additional measures. As a workaround this exploit may be avoided by appropriately restricting access to private networks from the host where the application is running.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/syuilo/misskey","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4b48ba4e8cff670ce4726417fe9b176cda0c4e76"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-39195.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e1a8b158e04ad567d92d8daf3cc0898ee18f1a2e"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-39195.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#12900-20210904"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/e1a8b158e04ad567d92d8daf3cc0898ee18f1a2e"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-mqv7-gxh4-r5vf"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
