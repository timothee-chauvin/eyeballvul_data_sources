{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68142","published":"2025-12-16T18:06:37.756Z","modified":"2025-12-20T15:36:38.349659Z","aliases":["GHSA-r6h4-mm7h-8pmq"],"summary":"PyMdown Extensions has ReDOS bug in Figure Capture extension","details":"PyMdown Extensions is a set of extensions for the `Python-Markdown` markdown project. Versions prior to 10.16.1 have a ReDOS bug found within the figure caption extension (`pymdownx.blocks.caption`). In systems that take unchecked user content, this could cause long hanges when processing the data if a malicious payload was crafted. This issue is patched in Release 10.16.1. As a workaround, those who process unknown user content without timeouts or other safeguards in place to prevent really large, malicious content being aimed at systems may avoid the use of `pymdownx.blocks.caption` until they're able to upgrade.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b50d15a56850ed1408a284bba81cc019c6bd72e8"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.7.0","1.8.0","10.0","10.0.1","10.1.0","10.10","10.10.1","10.10.2","10.11","10.11.1","10.11.2","10.12","10.13","10.14","10.14.1","10.14.2","10.14.3","10.15","10.16","10.2","10.2.1","10.3","10.3.1","10.4","10.5","10.6","10.7","10.7.1","10.8","10.8.1","10.9","2.0","3.0","3.1","3.2","3.2.1","3.3.0","3.4.0","3.5.0","4.0.0","4.1.0","4.10.0","4.10.1","4.10.2","4.11.0","4.12.0","4.2.0","4.3.0","4.4.0","4.5.0","4.5.1","4.6.0","4.7.0","4.8.0","4.9.0","4.9.1","4.9.2","5.0.0","6.0.0","6.1.0","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.3.0","7.0.0","7.0.0b2","7.0.0rc1","7.0.0rc2","7.1","8.0","8.0.1","8.1","8.1.1","8.2","9.0","9.1","9.10","9.10b2","9.10b3","9.10b4","9.10b5","9.11","9.2","9.3","9.4","9.5","9.6","9.7","9.8","9.9","9.9.1","9.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68142.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68142.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/commit/b50d15a56850ed1408a284bba81cc019c6bd72e8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-r6h4-mm7h-8pmq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68142"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://pypi.org/project/pymdown-extensions/10.16.1"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-1333"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68142.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
