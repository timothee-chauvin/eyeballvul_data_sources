Prior to version 0.0.13, the MCP Server is written in a way that is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability attacks as part of some of its MCP Server tool definition and implementation. The MCP Server exposes the tool `which-app-on-port` which relies on Node.js child process API `exec` which is an unsafe and vulnerable API if concatenated with untrusted user input. Version 0.0.13 contains a fix for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/akoskm/create-mcp-server-stdio","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"48c26bbe1f8c62764e4592f33c8300d1cadd2eac"}]}],"versions":["v0.0.1","v0.0.10","v0.0.11","v0.0.12","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54994.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/akoskm/create-mcp-server-stdio/blob/main/src/index.ts#L24-L40"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/akoskm/create-mcp-server-stdio/commit/48c26bbe1f8c62764e4592f33c8300d1cadd2eac"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/akoskm/create-mcp-server-stdio/security/advisories/GHSA-3ch2-jxxc-v4xf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-78"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
