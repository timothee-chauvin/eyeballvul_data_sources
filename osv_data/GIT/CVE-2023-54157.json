{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-54157","published":"2025-12-24T13:07:06.764Z","modified":"2025-12-24T21:19:38.810560Z","summary":"binder: fix UAF of alloc->vma in race with munmap()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbinder: fix UAF of alloc->vma in race with munmap()\n\n[ cmllamas: clean forward port from commit 015ac18be7de (\"binder: fix\n  UAF of alloc->vma in race with munmap()\") in 5.10 stable. It is needed\n  in mainline after the revert of commit a43cfc87caaf (\"android: binder:\n  stop saving a pointer to the VMA\") as pointed out by Liam. The commit\n  log and tags have been tweaked to reflect this. ]\n\nIn commit 720c24192404 (\"ANDROID: binder: change down_write to\ndown_read\") binder assumed the mmap read lock is sufficient to protect\nalloc->vma inside binder_update_page_range(). This used to be accurate\nuntil commit dd2283f2605e (\"mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem in\nmunmap\"), which now downgrades the mmap_lock after detaching the vma\nfrom the rbtree in munmap(). Then it proceeds to teardown and free the\nvma with only the read lock held.\n\nThis means that accesses to alloc->vma in binder_update_page_range() now\nwill race with vm_area_free() in munmap() and can cause a UAF as shown\nin the following KASAN trace:\n\n  ==================================================================\n  BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in vm_insert_page+0x7c/0x1f0\n  Read of size 8 at addr ffff16204ad00600 by task server/558\n\n  CPU: 3 PID: 558 Comm: server Not tainted 5.10.150-00001-gdc8dcf942daa #1\n  Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)\n  Call trace:\n   dump_backtrace+0x0/0x2a0\n   show_stack+0x18/0x2c\n   dump_stack+0xf8/0x164\n   print_address_description.constprop.0+0x9c/0x538\n   kasan_report+0x120/0x200\n   __asan_load8+0xa0/0xc4\n   vm_insert_page+0x7c/0x1f0\n   binder_update_page_range+0x278/0x50c\n   binder_alloc_new_buf+0x3f0/0xba0\n   binder_transaction+0x64c/0x3040\n   binder_thread_write+0x924/0x2020\n   binder_ioctl+0x1610/0x2e5c\n   __arm64_sys_ioctl+0xd4/0x120\n   el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0xac/0x270\n   do_el0_svc+0x38/0xa0\n   el0_svc+0x1c/0x2c\n   el0_sync_handler+0xe8/0x114\n   el0_sync+0x180/0x1c0\n\n  Allocated by task 559:\n   kasan_save_stack+0x38/0x6c\n   __kasan_kmalloc.constprop.0+0xe4/0xf0\n   kasan_slab_alloc+0x18/0x2c\n   kmem_cache_alloc+0x1b0/0x2d0\n   vm_area_alloc+0x28/0x94\n   mmap_region+0x378/0x920\n   do_mmap+0x3f0/0x600\n   vm_mmap_pgoff+0x150/0x17c\n   ksys_mmap_pgoff+0x284/0x2dc\n   __arm64_sys_mmap+0x84/0xa4\n   el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0xac/0x270\n   do_el0_svc+0x38/0xa0\n   el0_svc+0x1c/0x2c\n   el0_sync_handler+0xe8/0x114\n   el0_sync+0x180/0x1c0\n\n  Freed by task 560:\n   kasan_save_stack+0x38/0x6c\n   kasan_set_track+0x28/0x40\n   kasan_set_free_info+0x24/0x4c\n   __kasan_slab_free+0x100/0x164\n   kasan_slab_free+0x14/0x20\n   kmem_cache_free+0xc4/0x34c\n   vm_area_free+0x1c/0x2c\n   remove_vma+0x7c/0x94\n   __do_munmap+0x358/0x710\n   __vm_munmap+0xbc/0x130\n   __arm64_sys_munmap+0x4c/0x64\n   el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0xac/0x270\n   do_el0_svc+0x38/0xa0\n   el0_svc+0x1c/0x2c\n   el0_sync_handler+0xe8/0x114\n   el0_sync+0x180/0x1c0\n\n  [...]\n  ==================================================================\n\nTo prevent the race above, revert back to taking the mmap write lock\ninside binder_update_page_range().
