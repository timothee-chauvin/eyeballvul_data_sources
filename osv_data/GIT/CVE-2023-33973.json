{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-33973","published":"2023-05-30T16:18:04Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:38:20.191620Z","aliases":["GHSA-r2pv-3jqc-vh7w"],"summary":"RIOT-OS vulnerable to NULL pointer dereference during NHC encoding","details":"RIOT-OS, an operating system for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. In versions 2023.01 and prior, an attacker can send a crafted frame which is forwarded by the device. During encoding of the packet a NULL pointer dereference occurs. This crashes the device leading to denial of service. A patch is available at pull request 19678. There are no known workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/riot-os/riot","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"5d5e8d616331f7b2d21a74eb3dc8f144264df6f2"}]}],"versions":["2013.08","2014.01","2014.05","2014.12","2015.09-RC1","2015.12-RC1","2015.12-devel","2016.03-devel","2016.04-RC1","2016.07-RC1","2016.07-RC2","2016.07-devel","2016.10-RC1","2016.10-devel","2017.01-RC1","2017.01-devel","2017.04-RC1","2017.04-devel","2017.07-RC1","2017.07-devel","2017.10-RC1","2017.10-devel","2018.01-RC1","2018.01-devel","2018.04-RC1","2018.04-devel","2018.07-RC1","2018.07-devel","2018.10-RC1","2018.10-devel","2019.01-RC1","2019.01-devel","2019.04-RC1","2019.04-devel","2019.07-RC1","2019.07-devel","2019.10-RC1","2019.10-devel","2020.01-RC1","2020.01-devel","2020.04-RC1","2020.04-devel","2020.07-RC1","2020.07-devel","2020.10-RC1","2020.10-devel","2021.01-RC1","2021.01-devel","2021.04-RC1","2021.04-devel","2021.07-RC1","2021.07-devel","2021.10-RC1","2021.10-devel","2022.01-RC1","2022.01-devel","2022.04-RC1","2022.04-devel","2022.07-RC1","2022.07-devel","2022.10-RC1","2022.10-devel","2023.01-devel"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-33973.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-r2pv-3jqc-vh7w"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/c9d7863e5664a169035038628029bb07e090c5ff"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/19678"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/iphc/gnrc_sixlowpan_iphc.c#L1067"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/iphc/gnrc_sixlowpan_iphc.c#L1495"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/iphc/gnrc_sixlowpan_iphc.c#L1511"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/iphc/gnrc_sixlowpan_iphc.c#L1644"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/f41b4b67b6affca0a8b32edced7f51088696869a/sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/iphc/gnrc_sixlowpan_iphc.c#L1655"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
