The warning (at kernel/workqueue.c:4242 in\n__flush_work) occurs because the cleanup path tries to cancel an\nuninitialized work queue.\n\nWhen __netpoll_setup() encounters a device with IFF_DISABLE_NETPOLL,\nit fails early and calls skb_pool_flush() for cleanup. This function\ncalls cancel_work_sync(&np->refill_wq), but refill_wq hasn't been\ninitialized yet, triggering the warning.\n\nMove INIT_WORK() to the beginning of __netpoll_setup(), ensuring the\nwork queue is properly initialized before any potential failure points.\nThis allows the cleanup path to safely cancel the work queue regardless\nof where the setup fails.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"248f6571fd4c51531f7f8f07f186f7ae98a50afc"},{"fixed":"a90d0dc38a10347078cca60e7495ad0648838f18"},{"fixed":"760bc6ceda8e2c273c0e2018ad2595967c3dd308"},{"fixed":"e5235eb6cfe02a51256013a78f7b28779a7740d5"}]}],"versions":["v6.14","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.10","v6.17.11","v6.17.12","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68762.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.15.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.13"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68762.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/760bc6ceda8e2c273c0e2018ad2595967c3dd308"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a90d0dc38a10347078cca60e7495ad0648838f18"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e5235eb6cfe02a51256013a78f7b28779a7740d5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68762.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68762"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68762.json"}}
