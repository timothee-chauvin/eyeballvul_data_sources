In versions prior to 8.6.0-alpha.2, a GitHub CI workflow is triggered in a way that grants the GitHub Actions workflow elevated permissions, giving it access to GitHub secrets and write permissions which are defined in the workflow. Code from a fork or lifecycle scripts is potentially included. Only the repository's CI/CD infrastructure is affected, including any public GitHub forks with GitHub Actions enabled. This issue is fixed version 8.6.0-alpha.2 and commits 6b9f896 and e3d27fe.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"dcd05870fc67d01507f2d8f2041fc0f1dbfad2e6"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.0.8","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.10","2.2.11","2.2.12","2.2.13","2.2.14","2.2.15","2.2.16","2.2.17","2.2.18","2.2.19","2.2.2","2.2.20","2.2.21","2.2.22","2.2.23","2.2.24","2.2.25","2.2.25-beta.1","2.2.3","2.2.4","2.2.5","2.2.6","2.2.7","2.2.8","2.2.9","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.3.5","2.3.6","2.3.7","2.3.8","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.6.4","2.6.5","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.7.2","2.7.3","2.7.4","2.8.0","2.8.2","3.0.0","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.10.0","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.3.0","3.4.0","3.4.1","3.5.0","3.6.0","3.7.0","3.7.1","3.7.2","3.8.0","3.9.0","4.0.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.1.0","4.2.0","4.3.0","4.4.0","4.5.0","5.0.0","5.0.0-alpha.1","5.0.0-alpha.10","5.0.0-alpha.11","5.0.0-alpha.12","5.0.0-alpha.13","5.0.0-alpha.14","5.0.0-alpha.15","5.0.0-alpha.16","5.0.0-alpha.17","5.0.0-alpha.18","5.0.0-alpha.19","5.0.0-alpha.2","5.0.0-alpha.20","5.0.0-alpha.21","5.0.0-alpha.22","5.0.0-alpha.23","5.0.0-alpha.24","5.0.0-alpha.25","5.0.0-alpha.26","5.0.0-alpha.27","5.0.0-alpha.28","5.0.0-alpha.29","5.0.0-alpha.3","5.0.0-alpha.4","5.0.0-alpha.5","5.0.0-alpha.6","5.0.0-alpha.7","5.0.0-alpha.8","5.0.0-alpha.9","5.0.0-beta.1","5.0.0-beta.10","5.0.0-beta.2","5.0.0-beta.3","5.0.0-beta.4","5.0.0-beta.5","5.0.0-beta.6","5.0.0-beta.7","5.0.0-beta.8","5.0.0-beta.9","5.1.0","5.1.1","5.2.0","5.2.0-alpha.1","5.2.0-alpha.2","5.2.0-alpha.3","5.2.0-beta.1","5.2.0-beta.2","5.2.1","5.2.2","5.2.3","5.2.4","5.2.5","5.2.6","5.2.7","5.2.8","5.3.0","5.3.0-alpha.10","5.3.0-alpha.11","5.3.0-alpha.12","5.3.0-alpha.13","5.3.0-alpha.14","5.3.0-alpha.15","5.3.0-alpha.16","5.3.0-alpha.17","5.3.0-alpha.18","5.3.0-alpha.19","5.3.0-alpha.20","5.3.0-alpha.21","5.3.0-alpha.22","5.3.0-alpha.23","5.3.0-alpha.24","5.3.0-alpha.25","5.3.0-alpha.26","5.3.0-alpha.27","5.3.0-alpha.28","5.3.0-alpha.29","5.3.0-alpha.30","5.3.0-alpha.31","5.3.0-alpha.32","5.3.0-alpha.7","5.3.0-alpha.8","5.3.0-alpha.9","5.3.0-beta.1","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.4.0","5.4.0-alpha.1","5.4.0-beta.1","6.0.0","6.0.0-alpha.1","6.0.0-alpha.10","6.0.0-alpha.11","6.0.0-alpha.12","6.0.0-alpha.13","6.0.0-alpha.14","6.0.0-alpha.15","6.0.0-alpha.16","6.0.0-alpha.17","6.0.0-alpha.18","6.0.0-alpha.19","6.0.0-alpha.2","6.0.0-alpha.20","6.0.0-alpha.21","6.0.0-alpha.22","6.0.0-alpha.23","6.0.0-alpha.24","6.0.0-alpha.25","6.0.0-alpha.26","6.0.0-alpha.27","6.0.0-alpha.28","6.0.0-alpha.29","6.0.0-alpha.3","6.0.0-alpha.30","6.0.0-alpha.31","6.0.0-alpha.32","6.0.0-alpha.33","6.0.0-alpha.34","6.0.0-alpha.35","6.0.0-alpha.4","6.0.0-alpha.5","6.0.0-alpha.6","6.0.0-alpha.7","6.0.0-alpha.8","6.0.0-alpha.9","6.0.0-beta.1","6.1.0","6.1.0-alpha.1","6.1.0-alpha.10","6.1.0-alpha.11","6.1.0-alpha.12","6.1.0-alpha.13","6.1.0-alpha.14","6.1.0-alpha.15","6.1.0-alpha.16","6.1.0-alpha.17","6.1.0-alpha.18","6.1.0-alpha.19","6.1.0-alpha.2","6.1.0-alpha.20","6.1.0-alpha.3","6.1.0-alpha.4","6.1.0-alpha.5","6.1.0-alpha.6","6.1.0-alpha.7","6.1.0-alpha.8","6.1.0-alpha.9","6.1.0-beta.1","6.1.0-beta.2","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.2.2","6.3.0","6.3.0-alpha.1","6.3.0-alpha.2","6.3.0-alpha.3","6.3.0-alpha.4","6.3.0-alpha.5","6.3.0-alpha.6","6.3.0-alpha.7","6.3.0-alpha.8","6.3.0-alpha.9","6.3.0-beta.1","6.3.1","6.4.0","6.4.0-alpha.1","6.4.0-alpha.2","6.4.0-alpha.3","6.4.0-alpha.4","6.4.0-alpha.5","6.4.0-alpha.6","6.4.0-alpha.7","6.4.0-alpha.8","6.4.0-beta.1","6.5.0-alpha.1","6.5.0-alpha.2","6.5.0-beta.1","7.0.0","7.0.0-alpha.1","7.0.0-alpha.10","7.0.0-alpha.11","7.0.0-alpha.12","7.0.0-alpha.13","7.0.0-alpha.14","7.0.0-alpha.15","7.0.0-alpha.16","7.0.0-alpha.17","7.0.0-alpha.18","7.0.0-alpha.19","7.0.0-alpha.2","7.0.0-alpha.20","7.0.0-alpha.21","7.0.0-alpha.22","7.0.0-alpha.23","7.0.0-alpha.24","7.0.0-alpha.25","7.0.0-alpha.26","7.0.0-alpha.27","7.0.0-alpha.28","7.0.0-alpha.29","7.0.0-alpha.3","7.0.0-alpha.30","7.0.0-alpha.31","7.0.0-alpha.4","7.0.0-alpha.5","7.0.0-alpha.6","7.0.0-alpha.7","7.0.0-alpha.8","7.0.0-alpha.9","7.0.0-beta.1","7.1.0","7.1.0-alpha.1","7.1.0-alpha.10","7.1.0-alpha.11","7.1.0-alpha.12","7.1.0-alpha.13","7.1.0-alpha.14","7.1.0-alpha.15","7.1.0-alpha.16","7.1.0-alpha.2","7.1.0-alpha.3","7.1.0-alpha.4","7.1.0-alpha.5","7.1.0-alpha.6","7.1.0-alpha.7","7.1.0-alpha.8","7.1.0-alpha.9","7.1.0-beta.1","7.2.0","7.2.0-beta.1","7.3.0","7.3.0-alpha.1","7.3.0-alpha.2","7.3.0-alpha.3","7.3.0-alpha.4","7.3.0-alpha.5","7.3.0-alpha.6","7.3.0-alpha.7","7.3.0-alpha.8","7.3.0-alpha.9","7.3.0-beta.1","7.3.1-alpha.1","7.4.0","7.4.0-alpha.1","7.4.0-alpha.2","7.4.0-alpha.3","7.4.0-alpha.4","7.4.0-alpha.5","7.4.0-alpha.6","7.4.0-alpha.7","7.4.0-beta.1","8.0.0","8.0.0-alpha.1","8.0.0-alpha.10","8.0.0-alpha.11","8.0.0-alpha.12","8.0.0-alpha.13","8.0.0-alpha.
