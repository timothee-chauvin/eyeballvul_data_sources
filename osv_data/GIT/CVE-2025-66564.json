{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-66564","published":"2025-12-04T22:37:13.307Z","modified":"2025-12-11T12:14:46.998780Z","aliases":["GHSA-4qg8-fj49-pxjh","GO-2025-4192"],"summary":"Sigstore Timestamp Authority allocates excessive memory during request parsing","details":"Sigstore Timestamp Authority is a service for issuing RFC 3161 timestamps. Prior to 2.0.3, Function api.ParseJSONRequest currently splits (via a call to strings.Split) an optionally-provided OID (which is untrusted data) on periods. Similarly, function api.getContentType splits the Content-Type header (which is also untrusted data) on an application string. As a result, in the face of a malicious request with either an excessively long OID in the payload containing many period characters or a malformed Content-Type header, a call to api.ParseJSONRequest or api.getContentType incurs allocations of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function's argument). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.0.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/sigstore/timestamp-authority","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"22406c3ff80d3543d2f2819e4f3cf944b5fe306c"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-rc.0","v1.0.0-rc.1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.2.9","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66564.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66564.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/timestamp-authority/commit/0cae34e197d685a14904e0bad135b89d13b69421"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/sigstore/timestamp-authority/security/advisories/GHSA-4qg8-fj49-pxjh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66564"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-405"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66564.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
