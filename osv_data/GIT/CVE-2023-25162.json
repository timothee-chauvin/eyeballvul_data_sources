{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-25162","published":"2023-02-13T20:34:29.201Z","modified":"2025-12-04T23:42:10.869794Z","aliases":["GHSA-mqrx-grp7-244m"],"summary":"Nextcloud Server vulnerable to SSRF via filter bypass due to lax checking on IPs","details":"Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Nextcloud Server prior to 24.0.8 and 23.0.12 and Nextcloud Enterprise server prior to 24.0.8 and 23.0.12 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF). Attackers can leverage enclosed alphanumeric payloads to bypass IP filters and gain SSRF, which would allow an attacker to read crucial metadata if the server is hosted on the AWS platform. Nextcloud Server 24.0.8 and 23.0.2 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server 24.0.8 and 23.0.12 contain a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4eca7512330808a958cbf00bbd9044ea77b3ab6b"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"23.0.12"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server","events":[{"introduced":"5f37aacb3194d51503aaa3529ae8f676b32a25d7"},{"fixed":"888ffa498d3a08bb32591704806ee90075b4bc20"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"24.0.0"},{"fixed":"24.0.8"}]}}],"versions":["list","v1.0.0beta1","v1.0RC1","v1.1","v11.0.0","v11.0RC2","v12.0.0beta1","v12.0.0beta2","v12.0.0beta3","v12.0.0beta4","v13.0.0RC1","v13.0.0beta1","v13.0.0beta2","v13.0.0beta3","v13.0.0beta4","v14.0.0RC1","v14.0.0RC2","v14.0.0beta1","v14.0.0beta2","v14.0.0beta3","v14.0.0beta4","v15.0.0RC1","v15.0.0beta1","v15.0.0beta2","v16.0.0RC1","v16.0.0alpha1","v16.0.0beta1","v16.0.0beta2","v16.0.0beta3","v17.0.0beta1","v17.0.0beta2","v17.0.0beta3","v17.0.0beta4","v18.0.0RC1","v18.0.0beta1","v18.0.0beta2","v18.0.0beta3","v18.0.0beta4","v19.0.0RC1","v19.0.0RC2","v19.0.0beta1","v19.0.0beta2","v19.0.0beta3","v19.0.0beta4","v19.0.0beta5","v19.0.0beta6","v19.0.0beta7","v2.0beta3","v20.0.0RC1","v20.0.0beta1","v20.0.0beta2","v20.0.0beta3","v20.0.0beta4","v21.0.0beta1","v21.0.0beta2","v21.0.0beta3","v21.0.0beta4","v21.0.0beta5","v21.0.0beta6","v21.0.0beta7","v21.0.0beta8","v22.0.0beta1","v22.0.0beta2","v22.0.0beta3","v22.0.0beta4","v22.0.0beta5","v22.0.0rc1","v23.0.0","v23.0.0beta1","v23.0.0beta2","v23.0.0beta3","v23.0.0rc1","v23.0.0rc2","v23.0.0rc3","v23.0.1","v23.0.10","v23.0.10rc1","v23.0.11","v23.0.11rc1","v23.0.12rc1","v23.0.12rc2","v23.0.1rc1","v23.0.1rc2","v23.0.1rc3","v23.0.2","v23.0.2rc1","v23.0.3","v23.0.3rc1","v23.0.3rc2","v23.0.4","v23.0.4rc1","v23.0.5","v23.0.5rc1","v23.0.6","v23.0.6rc1","v23.0.7","v23.0.7rc1","v23.0.7rc2","v23.0.8","v23.0.8rc1","v23.0.9","v23.0.9rc1","v24.0.0","v24.0.1","v24.0.1rc1","v24.0.2","v24.0.2rc1","v24.0.3","v24.0.3rc1","v24.0.3rc2","v24.0.4","v24.0.4rc1","v24.0.5","v24.0.5rc1","v24.0.6","v24.0.6rc1","v24.0.7","v24.0.7rc1","v24.0.8rc1","v24.0.8rc2","v3.0","v3.0RC1","v3.0alpha1","v4.0.0","v4.0.0RC","v4.0.0RC2","v4.0.0beta","v4.0.1","v4.0.3","v4.0.4","v4.0.5","v4.0.6","v4.5.0","v4.5.0RC1","v4.5.0RC2","v4.5.0RC3","v4.5.0beta1","v4.5.0beta2","v4.5.0beta3","v4.5.0beta4","v5.0.0","v5.0.0RC1","v5.0.0RC2","v5.0.0RC3","v5.0.0alpha1","v5.0.0beta1","v5.0.0beta2","v6.0.0RC1","v6.0.0RC2","v6.0.0alpha2","v6.0.0beta2","v6.0.0beta3","v6.0.0beta4","v6.0.0beta5","v7.0.0alpha2","v7.0.0beta1","v8.0.0","v8.0.0RC1","v8.0.0RC2","v8.0.0alpha1","v8.0.0alpha2","v8.0.0beta1","v8.0.0beta2","v8.1.0alpha1","v8.1.0alpha2","v8.1.0beta1","v8.1.0beta2","v8.1RC2","v8.2RC1","v8.2beta1","v9.0.0beta2","v9.0.1beta2","v9.0beta1","v9.1.0beta1","v9.1.0beta2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-25162.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/25xxx/CVE-2023-25162.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-mqrx-grp7-244m"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/34160"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1702864"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25162"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/25xxx/CVE-2023-25162.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
