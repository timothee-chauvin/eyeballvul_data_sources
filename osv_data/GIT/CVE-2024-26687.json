Both\nare called with the irq_desc->lock being taking. The lock order,\nhowever, is first irq_mapping_update_lock and then irq_desc->lock.\n\nThis opens multiple races:\n- shutdown_pirq can be interrupted by a function that allocates an event\n  channel:\n\n  CPU0                        CPU1\n  shutdown_pirq {\n    xen_evtchn_close(e)\n                              __startup_pirq {\n                                EVTCHNOP_bind_pirq\n                                  -> returns just freed evtchn e\n                                set_evtchn_to_irq(e, irq)\n                              }\n    xen_irq_info_cleanup() {\n      set_evtchn_to_irq(e, -1)\n    }\n  }\n\n  Assume here event channel e refers here to the same event channel\n  number.\n  After this race the evtchn_to_irq mapping for e is invalid (-1).\n\n- __startup_pirq races with __unbind_from_irq in a similar way. Because\n  __startup_pirq doesn't take irq_mapping_update_lock it can grab the\n  evtchn that __unbind_from_irq is currently freeing and cleaning up. In\n  this case even though the event channel is allocated, its mapping can\n  be unset in evtchn_to_irq.\n\nThe fix is to first cleanup the mappings and then close the event\nchannel. In this way, when an event channel gets allocated it's\npotential previous evtchn_to_irq mappings are guaranteed to be unset already.\nThis is also the reverse order of the allocation where first the event\nchannel is allocated and then the mappings are setup.\n\nOn a 5.10 kernel prior to commit 3fcdaf3d7634 (\"xen/events: modify internal\n[un]bind interfaces\"), we hit a BUG like the following during probing of NVMe\ndevices. The issue is that during nvme_setup_io_queues, pci_free_irq\nis called for every device which results in a call to shutdown_pirq.\nWith many nvme devices it's therefore likely to hit this race during\nboot because there will be multiple calls to shutdown_pirq and\nstartup_pirq are running potentially in parallel.\n\n  ------------[ cut here ]------------\n  blkfront: xvda: barrier or flush:
