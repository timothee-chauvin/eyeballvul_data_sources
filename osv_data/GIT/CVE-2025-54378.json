In versions 11.0.13 and below of haxcms-nodejs and versions 11.0.8 and below of haxcms-php, API endpoints do not perform authorization checks when interacting with a resource. Both the JS and PHP versions of the CMS do not verify that a user has permission to interact with a resource before performing a given operation. The API endpoints within the HAX CMS application check if a user is authenticated, but don't check for authorization before performing an operation. This is fixed in versions 11.0.14 of haxcms-nodejs and 11.0.9 of haxcms-php.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5826e9b7f3d8c7c7635411768b86b199fad36969"}]}],"versions":["10.0.0","v0.0.10","v0.0.11","v0.0.12","v0.0.13","v0.0.14","v0.0.15","v0.0.16","v0.0.17","v0.0.18","v0.0.19","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.0.6","v0.0.7","v0.0.8","v0.0.9","v10.0.1","v10.0.2","v10.0.3","v10.0.4","v10.0.5","v10.0.6","v11.0.0","v11.0.1","v11.0.10","v11.0.11","v11.0.12","v11.0.13","v11.0.2","v11.0.3","v11.0.4","v11.0.5","v11.0.6","v11.0.7","v11.0.8","v11.0.9","v9.0.0","v9.0.0-alpha.0","v9.0.0-alpha.1","v9.0.1","v9.0.10","v9.0.11","v9.0.12","v9.0.13","v9.0.14","v9.0.15","v9.0.16","v9.0.17","v9.0.18","v9.0.19","v9.0.2","v9.0.20","v9.0.21","v9.0.3","v9.0.4","v9.0.5","v9.0.6","v9.0.7","v9.0.8","v9.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54378.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-php","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"24d30222481ada037597c4d7c0a51a1ef7af6cfd"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.1.0","0.11.0","0.12.0","0.12.1","0.12.2","0.12.3","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.6.0","0.7.0","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.8.2","0.9.0","1.0.0","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.10","1.2.11","1.2.12","1.2.13","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.2.5","1.2.6","1.2.7","1.2.8","1.2.9","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.4.0","10.0.0","10.0.3","11.0.0","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.0.8","2.0.9","3.0.0","4.0.0","4.1.0","5.1.0","6.0.1","7.0.1","7.0.10","7.0.13","7.0.14","7.0.15","7.0.16","7.0.2","7.0.3","8.0.0","9.0.21","v10.0.3","v11.0.0","v11.0.1","v11.0.5","v11.0.6","v11.0.7","v11.0.8","v9.0.0","v9.0.1","v9.0.2","v9.0.3","v9.0.5","v9.0.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-54378.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs/commit/5826e9b7f3d8c7c7635411768b86b199fad36969"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-php/commit/24d30222481ada037597c4d7c0a51a1ef7af6cfd"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/security/advisories/GHSA-9jr9-8ff3-m894"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-285","CWE-862"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H"}]}
