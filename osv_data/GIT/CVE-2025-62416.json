Bagisto v2.3.7 is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) due to unsanitized user input being processed by the server-side templating engine when rendering product descriptions. This allows an attacker with product creation privileges to inject arbitrary template expressions that are evaluated by the backend â€” potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.8.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"f033c5aa915a051614ff1b9bc83b8d3fd4cec9c1"}]}],"versions":["1.4.0","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v0.1.4-BETA1","v0.1.4-BETA2","v0.1.4-BETA3","v0.1.4-BETA4","v0.1.5","v0.1.6","v0.1.6-ALPHA1","v0.1.7","v0.1.7-BETA1","v0.1.7-BETA2","v0.1.8","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-BETA1","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-BETA1","v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.4.2","v1.4.3","v1.4.4","v1.4.5","v1.5.0","v1.5.1","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-BETA-1","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.1.2","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.10","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.2.5","v2.2.6","v2.2.7","v2.2.8","v2.2.9","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3","v2.3.4","v2.3.5","v2.3.6","v2.3.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62416.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto/security/advisories/GHSA-527q-4wqv-g9wj"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1336","CWE-94"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
