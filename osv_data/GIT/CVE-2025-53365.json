Prior to version 1.10.0, if a client deliberately triggers an exception after establishing a streamable HTTP session, this can lead to an uncaught ClosedResourceError on the server side, causing the server to crash and requiring a restart to restore service. Impact may vary depending on the deployment conditions, and presence of infrastructure-level resilience measures. Version 1.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"dced22344d80d85884df9c26281fdfe0331e9c65"}]}],"versions":["v0.6.0","v0.8.0","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.0rc1","v1.4.0","v1.4.1","v1.5.0","v1.6.0","v1.7.0","v1.8.0","v1.8.1","v1.9.0","v1.9.1","v1.9.2","v1.9.3","v1.9.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-53365.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/commit/7b420656de48cfdb90b39eb582e60b6d55c2f891"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/pull/967"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-j975-95f5-7wqh"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-248"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
