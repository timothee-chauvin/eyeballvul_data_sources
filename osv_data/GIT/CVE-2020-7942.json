{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2020-7942","published":"2020-02-19T21:15:11Z","modified":"2025-11-08T12:07:37.998490Z","aliases":["GHSA-gqvf-892r-vjm5"],"related":["SUSE-SU-2020:1057-1"],"details":"Previously, Puppet operated on a model that a node with a valid certificate was entitled to all information in the system and that a compromised certificate allowed access to everything in the infrastructure. When a node's catalog falls back to the `default` node, the catalog can be retrieved for a different node by modifying facts for the Puppet run. This issue can be mitigated by setting `strict_hostname_checking = true` in `puppet.conf` on your Puppet master. Puppet 6.13.0 and 5.5.19 changes the default behavior for strict_hostname_checking from false to true. It is recommended that Puppet Open Source and Puppet Enterprise users that are not upgrading still set strict_hostname_checking to true to ensure secure behavior.
