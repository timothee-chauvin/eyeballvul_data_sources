It occurs in the storagePoolLookupByTargetPath function where a locked virStoragePoolObj object is not properly released on ACL permission failure. Clients connecting to the read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to acquire the lock and prevent other users from accessing storage pool/volume APIs, resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/libvirt/libvirt","events":[{"introduced":"6b59754bfda9477586a75af0c0b9ce1036c414e8"}]}],"versions":["CVE-2025-12748","CVE-2025-13193","v10.0.0","v10.0.0-rc1","v10.0.0-rc2","v10.1.0","v10.1.0-rc1","v10.1.0-rc2","v10.10.0","v10.10.0-rc1","v10.10.0-rc2","v10.2.0","v10.2.0-rc1","v10.2.0-rc2","v10.3.0","v10.3.0-rc1","v10.4.0","v10.4.0-rc1","v10.4.0-rc2","v10.5.0","v10.5.0-rc1","v10.5.0-rc2","v10.6.0","v10.6.0-rc1","v10.7.0","v10.7.0-rc1","v10.7.0-rc2","v10.8.0","v10.8.0-rc1","v10.8.0-rc2","v10.9.0","v10.9.0-rc1","v10.9.0-rc2","v11.0.0","v11.0.0-rc1","v11.0.0-rc2","v11.1.0","v11.1.0-rc1","v11.1.0-rc2","v11.10.0","v11.10.0-rc1","v11.10.0-rc2","v11.2.0","v11.2.0-rc1","v11.2.0-rc2","v11.3.0","v11.3.0-rc1","v11.3.0-rc2","v11.4.0","v11.4.0-rc1","v11.4.0-rc2","v11.5.0","v11.5.0-rc1","v11.5.0-rc2","v11.6.0","v11.6.0-rc1","v11.6.0-rc2","v11.7.0","v11.7.0-rc1","v11.7.0-rc2","v11.8.0","v11.8.0-rc1","v11.8.0-rc2","v11.9.0","v11.9.0-rc1","v11.9.0-rc2","v4.1.0","v4.10.0","v4.10.0-rc1","v4.10.0-rc2","v4.2.0","v4.2.0-rc1","v4.2.0-rc2","v4.3.0","v4.3.0-rc1","v4.3.0-rc2","v4.4.0","v4.4.0-rc1","v4.4.0-rc2","v4.5.0","v4.5.0-rc1","v4.5.0-rc2","v4.6.0","v4.6.0-rc1","v4.6.0-rc2","v4.7.0","v4.7.0-rc1","v4.7.0-rc2","v4.8.0","v4.8.0-rc1","v4.8.0-rc2","v4.9.0","v4.9.0-rc1","v5.0.0","v5.0.0-rc1","v5.0.0-rc2","v5.1.0","v5.1.0-rc1","v5.1.0-rc2","v5.10.0","v5.10.0-rc1","v5.10.0-rc2","v5.2.0","v5.2.0-rc1","v5.2.0-rc2","v5.3.0","v5.3.0-rc1","v5.3.0-rc2","v5.4.0","v5.4.0-rc1","v5.4.0-rc2","v5.5.0","v5.5.0-rc1","v5.5.0-rc2","v5.6.0","v5.6.0-rc1","v5.6.0-rc2","v5.7.0","v5.7.0-rc1","v5.7.0-rc2","v5.8.0","v5.8.0-rc1","v5.8.0-rc2","v5.9.0","v5.9.0-rc1","v6.0.0","v6.0.0-rc1","v6.0.0-rc2","v6.1.0","v6.1.0-rc1","v6.1.0-rc2","v6.10.0","v6.10.0-rc1","v6.10.0-rc2","v6.2.0","v6.2.0-rc1","v6.3.0","v6.3.0-rc1","v6.4.0","v6.4.0-rc1","v6.5.0","v6.5.0-rc1","v6.5.0-rc2","v6.6.0","v6.6.0-rc1","v6.7.0","v6.7.0-rc1","v6.7.0-rc2","v6.8.0","v6.8.0-rc1","v6.8.0-rc2","v6.9.0","v6.9.0-rc1","v6.9.0-rc2","v7.0.0","v7.0.0-rc1","v7.0.0-rc2","v7.1.0","v7.1.0-rc1","v7.1.0-rc2","v7.10.0","v7.10.0-rc1","v7.10.0-rc2","v7.2.0","v7.2.0-rc1","v7.2.0-rc2","v7.3.0","v7.3.0-rc1","v7.3.0-rc2","v7.4.0","v7.4.0-rc1","v7.4.0-rc2","v7.5.0","v7.5.0-rc1","v7.5.0-rc2","v7.6.0","v7.6.0-rc1","v7.6.0-rc2","v7.7.0","v7.7.0-rc1","v7.7.0-rc2","v7.8.0","v7.8.0-rc1","v7.8.0-rc2","v7.9.0","v7.9.0-rc1","v7.9.0-rc2","v8.0.0","v8.0.0-rc1","v8.0.0-rc2","v8.1.0","v8.1.0-rc1","v8.1.0-rc2","v8.10.0","v8.10.0-rc1","v8.10.0-rc2","v8.2.0","v8.2.0-rc1","v8.2.0-rc2","v8.3.0","v8.3.0-rc1","v8.3.0-rc2","v8.4.0","v8.4.0-rc1","v8.4.0-rc2","v8.5.0","v8.5.0-rc1","v8.5.0-rc2","v8.6.0","v8.6.0-rc1","v8.6.0-rc2","v8.7.0","v8.7.0-rc1","v8.7.0-rc2","v8.8.0","v8.8.0-rc1","v8.8.0-rc2","v8.9.0","v8.9.0-rc1","v8.9.0-rc2","v9.0.0","v9.0.0-rc1","v9.0.0-rc2","v9.1.0","v9.1.0-rc1","v9.1.0-rc2","v9.10.0","v9.10.0-rc1","v9.10.0-rc2","v9.2.0","v9.2.0-rc1","v9.2.0-rc2","v9.3.0","v9.3.0-rc1","v9.3.0-rc2","v9.4.0","v9.4.0-rc1","v9.4.0-rc2","v9.5.0","v9.5.0-rc1","v9.5.0-rc2","v9.6.0","v9.6.0-rc1","v9.6.0-rc2","v9.7.0","v9.7.0-rc1","v9.7.0-rc2","v9.8.0","v9.8.0-rc1","v9.8.0-rc2","v9.9.0","v9.9.0-rc1","v9.9.0-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-3667.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"447f69dec47e1b0bd15ecd7cd49a9fd3b050fb87"}]}],"versions":["CVE-2011-1146","CVE-2011-1486","CVE-2011-2178","CVE-2012-3411","CVE-2012-3445","CVE-2012-4423","CVE-2013-0170","CVE-2013-1962","CVE-2013-2218","CVE-2013-2230","CVE-2013-4153","CVE-2013-4154","CVE-2013-4239","CVE-2013-4291","CVE-2013-4292","CVE-2013-4296","CVE-2013-4297","CVE-2013-4311","CVE-2013-4399","CVE-2013-4400-1","CVE-2013-4400-2","CVE-2013-4400-3","CVE-2013-4401","CVE-2013-5651","CVE-2013-6436","CVE-2013-6457","CVE-2013-6458-1","CVE-2013-6458-2","CVE-2013-6458-3","CVE-2013-6458-4","CVE-2013-7336","CVE-2014-0028","CVE-2014-0179","CVE-2014-1447-1","CVE-2014-1447-2","CVE-2014-3633","CVE-2014-3657","CVE-2014-7823","CVE-2014-8131-1","CVE-2014-8131-2","CVE-2014-8135","CVE-2014-8136","CVE-2015-0236-1","CVE-2015-0236-2","CVE-2015-5247-1","CVE-2015-5247-2","CVE-2015-5247-3","CVE-2015-5313","CVE-2016-5008","CVE-2017-1000256","CVE-2017-2635","LIBVIRT_0_0_3","LIBVIRT_0_0_4","LIBVIRT_0_0_5","LIBVIRT_0_1_0","LIBVIRT_0_1_1","LIBVIRT_0_1_10","LIBVIRT_0_1_11","LIBVIRT_0_1_3","LIBVIRT_0_1_4","LIBVIRT_0_1_6","LIBVIRT_0_1_7","LIBVIRT_0_1_8","LIBVIRT_0_1_9","LIBVIRT_0_2_0","LIBVIRT_0_2_1","LIBVIRT_0_2_2","LIBVIRT_0_3_0","LIBVIRT_0_3_1","LIBVIRT_0_3_2","LIBVIRT_0_3_3","LIBVIRT_0_4_1","LIBVIRT_0_4_2","LIBVIRT_0_4_4","LIBVIRT_0_4_6","LIBVIRT_0_5_0","LIBVIRT_0_5_1","LIBVIRT_0_6_0","LIBVIRT_0_6_1","LIBVIRT_0_6_2","LIBVIRT_0_6_3","LIBVIRT_0_6_4","LIBVIRT_0_6_5","LIBVIR_0_0_1","LIBVIR_0_0_2","LIVIRT_0_2_3","v0.0.1","v0.0.2","v0.0.3","v0.0.4","v0.0.5","v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.10","v0.1.11","v0.1.3","
