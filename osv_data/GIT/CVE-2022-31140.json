Prior to version 0.12.0, Valinor can use `Throwable#getMessage()` when it should not have permission to do so. This is a problem with cases such as an SQL exception showing an SQL snippet, a database connection exception showing database IP address/username/password, or a timeout detail / out of memory detail. Attackers could use this information for potential data exfiltration, denial of service attacks, enumeration attacks, etc. Version 0.12.0 contains a patch for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/cuyz/valinor","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bd74557e752ee66ccb51d83a87b36e127110e791"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.10.0","0.11.0","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.6.0","0.7.0","0.8.0","0.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-31140.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/31xxx/CVE-2022-31140.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/CuyZ/Valinor/releases/tag/0.12.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CuyZ/Valinor/security/advisories/GHSA-5pgm-3j3g-2rc7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31140"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-209"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/31xxx/CVE-2022-31140.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
