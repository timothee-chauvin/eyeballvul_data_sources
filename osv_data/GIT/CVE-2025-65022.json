In versions 2.10.0 and prior, an authenticated time-based SQL injection vulnerability exists in the ieducar/intranet/agenda.php script. An attacker with access to an authenticated session can execute arbitrary SQL commands against the application's database. This vulnerability is caused by the improper handling of the cod_agenda request parameter, which is directly concatenated into multiple SQL queries without proper sanitization. This issue has been patched in commit b473f92.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"b473f92b5326f45d7bce2de93a5381bed7ca8ac7"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.10","2.0.11","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.0.8","2.0.8.1","2.0.9","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.10","2.1.11","2.1.12","2.1.13","2.1.14","2.1.15","2.1.16","2.1.17","2.1.18","2.1.19","2.1.2","2.1.20","2.1.21","2.1.23-upgrade","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.1.7","2.1.8","2.1.9","2.10.0","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.10","2.2.11","2.2.12","2.2.13","2.2.14","2.2.15","2.2.16","2.2.17","2.2.18","2.2.19","2.2.2","2.2.20","2.2.21-upgrade","2.2.3","2.2.4","2.2.5","2.2.6","2.2.7","2.2.8","2.2.9","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.10","2.3.2","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.3.5","2.3.6","2.3.7","2.3.8","2.3.9","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.5.4-upgrade","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.6.4","2.6.5","2.6.6","2.6.7","2.6.8","2.6.9","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.7.2","2.7.3","2.7.4","2.8.0","2.8.0-beta","2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-65022.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/65xxx/CVE-2025-65022.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar/commit/b473f92b5326f45d7bce2de93a5381bed7ca8ac7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar/security/advisories/GHSA-4hrj-5gwx-r4w4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65022"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-89"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/65xxx/CVE-2025-65022.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
