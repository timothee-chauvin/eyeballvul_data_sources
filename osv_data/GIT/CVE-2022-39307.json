When using the forget password on the login page, a POST request is made to the `/api/user/password/sent-reset-email` URL. When the username or email does not exist, a JSON response contains a “user not found” message. This leaks information to unauthenticated users and introduces a security risk. This issue has been patched in 9.2.4 and backported to 8.5.15. There are no known workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana","events":[{"introduced":"f89df6e171b912a5c8beace1ba6356dcbc108741"},{"fixed":"64017e8ca6825b79a2acb887a1c1d9088e47ed72"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"v9.0.0-beta1"},{"fixed":"9.2.4"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"be4228db5a43f65a989239f891185d45912d39ad"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8.5.15"}]}}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39307.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-3p62-42x7-gxg5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221215-0004/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}]}
