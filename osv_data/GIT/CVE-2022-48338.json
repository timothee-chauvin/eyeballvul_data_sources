In ruby-mode.el, the ruby-find-library-file function has a local command injection vulnerability. The ruby-find-library-file function is an interactive function, and bound to C-c C-f. Inside the function, the external command gem is called through shell-command-to-string, but the feature-name parameters are not escaped. Thus, malicious Ruby source files may cause commands to be executed.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://cgit.git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9a3b08061feea14d6f37685ca1ab8801758bfd1c"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-48338.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-48338.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FLPQ4K6H2S5TY3L5UDN4K4B3L5RQJYQ6/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U6HDBUQNAH2WL4MHWCTUZLN7NGF7CHTK/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5360"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=9a3b08061feea14d6f37685ca1ab8801758bfd1c"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
