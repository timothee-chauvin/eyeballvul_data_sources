Calling `jws.Parse` with a JSON serialized payload where the `signature` field is present while `protected` is absent can lead to a nil pointer dereference. The vulnerability can be used to crash/DOS a system doing JWS verification. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 2.0.19 and 1.2.28.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx","events":[{"introduced":"8f97f606570bc3de90005ce3188824e7e7eff88a"},{"fixed":"d69a721931a5c48b9850a42404f18e143704adcd"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.0.19"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx","events":[{"introduced":"3bb9a18ceb5f45ffc4d0b837f85a5c3eb3f0bbfe"},{"fixed":"8c53d0ae52d5ab1e2b37c5abb67def9e7958fd65"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"1.0.8"},{"fixed":"1.2.28"}]}}],"versions":["v1.0.8","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.1.3","v1.1.4","v1.1.5","v1.1.5-rc1","v1.1.6","v1.1.7","v1.1.7-rc1","v1.1.8-rc1","v1.2.0","v1.2.1","v1.2.10","v1.2.11","v1.2.12","v1.2.13","v1.2.14","v1.2.15","v1.2.17","v1.2.18","v1.2.19","v1.2.2","v1.2.20","v1.2.21","v1.2.22","v1.2.23","v1.2.24","v1.2.25","v1.2.26","v1.2.27","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.2.6","v1.2.7","v1.2.8","v1.2.9","v2.0.0","v2.0.1","v2.0.10","v2.0.11","v2.0.12","v2.0.14","v2.0.15","v2.0.16","v2.0.17","v2.0.18","v2.0.2","v2.0.3","v2.0.4","v2.0.5","v2.0.6","v2.0.7","v2.0.8","v2.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-21664.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/commit/0e8802ce6842625845d651456493e7c87625601f"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/commit/8c53d0ae52d5ab1e2b37c5abb67def9e7958fd65"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/commit/d69a721931a5c48b9850a42404f18e143704adcd"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/security/advisories/GHSA-pvcr-v8j8-j5q3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-476"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
