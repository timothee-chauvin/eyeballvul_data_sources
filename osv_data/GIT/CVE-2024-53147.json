the directory size is greater than or equal to\nthe cluster size, if start_clu becomes an EOF cluster(an invalid\ncluster) due to file system corruption, then the directory entry\nwhere ei->hint_femp.eidx hint is outside the directory, resulting\nin an out-of-bounds access, which may cause further file system\ncorruption.\n\nThis commit adds a check for start_clu, if it is an invalid
