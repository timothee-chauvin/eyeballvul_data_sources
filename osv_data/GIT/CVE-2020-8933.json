Using the membership to the \"lxd\" group, an attacker can attach host devices and filesystems. Within an lxc container, it is possible to attach the host OS filesystem and modify /etc/sudoers to then gain administrative privileges. All images created after 2020-May-07 (20200507) are fixed, and if you cannot update, we recommend you edit /etc/group/security.conf and remove the \"lxd\" user from the OS Login entry.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/guest-oslogin","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"7b956e59ae133351ddee60cfc471bb9f854c71e3"}]}],"versions":["20200113.00","20200116.00","20200325.00","20200504.00","20200507.00"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-8933.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00037.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00047.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins/#gcp-2020-008"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/guest-oslogin/pull/29"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/gl-redteam/red-team-tech-notes/-/tree/master/oslogin-privesc-june-2020"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
