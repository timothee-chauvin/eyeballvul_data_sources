This\nproblem exists since commit\n\n  9e798e9aa14c (\"x86/fpu: Prepare fpu_clone() for dynamically enabled features\").\n\nEven though the original bug report should not have enabled the paths at\nall, the bug still exists.\n\nfpregs_lock is necessary when editing the FPU registers or a task's FP\nstate but it is not necessary for fpu_inherit_perms(). The only write\nof any FP state in fpu_inherit_perms() is for the new child which is\nnot running yet and cannot context switch or be borrowed by a kernel\nthread yet. Hence, fpregs_lock is not protecting anything in the new\nchild until clone() completes and can be dropped earlier. The siglock\nstill needs to be acquired by fpu_inherit_perms() as the read of the\nparent's permissions has to be serialised.\n\n  [ bp: Cleanup splat. ]","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9e798e9aa14c45fb94e47b30bf6347b369ce9df7"},{"fixed":"c6e8a7a1780af3da65e78a615f7d0874da6aabb0"},{"fixed":"36b038791e1e2baea892e9276588815fd14894b4"}]}],"versions":["v5.15","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.0.5","v6.0.6","v6.0.7","v6.0.8","v6.0.9","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49783.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-49783.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/36b038791e1e2baea892e9276588815fd14894b4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c6e8a7a1780af3da65e78a615f7d0874da6aabb0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49783.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49783"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/49xxx/CVE-2022-49783.json"}}
