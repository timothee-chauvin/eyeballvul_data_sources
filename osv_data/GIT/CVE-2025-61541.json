{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-61541","published":"2025-10-16T15:15:34.713Z","modified":"2025-11-20T12:40:08.373512Z","details":"Webmin 2.510 is vulnerable to a Host Header Injection in the password reset functionality (forgot_send.cgi). The reset link sent to users is constructed using the HTTP Host header via get_webmin_email_url(). An attacker can manipulate the Host header to inject a malicious domain into the reset email. If a victim follows the poisoned link, the attacker can intercept the reset token and gain full control of the target account.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/webmin/webmin","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"f7058f10b4e98753b3797bc68dc0929a9c03ca22"}]}],"versions":["1.700","1.710","1.720","1.730","1.740","1.750","1.760","1.770","1.780","1.790","1.800","1.801","1.810","1.820","1.830","1.831","1.840","1.850","1.860","1.870","1.880","1.890","1.900","1.910","1.920","1.930","1.940","1.941","1.950","1.951","1.953","1.954","1.955","1.960","1.962","1.970","1.972","1.973","1.974","1.979","1.980","1.982","1.983","1.984","1.990","1.991","1.993","1.994","1.995","1.996","1.997","1.998","1.999","2.000","2.001","2.003","2.010","2.011","2.012","2.013","2.020","2.021","2.100","2.101","2.102","2.103","2.104","2.105","2.110","2.111","2.200","2.201","2.202","2.300","2.301","2.302","2.303","2.400","2.401","2.402","2.500","2.501","2.510"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-61541.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.webmin.com/"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://github.com/bugdotexe/Vulnerability-Research/tree/main/CVE-2025-61541"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/webmin/webmin"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H"}]}
