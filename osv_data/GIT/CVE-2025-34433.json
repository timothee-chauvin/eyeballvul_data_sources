{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-34433","published":"2025-12-19T16:15:55.393Z","modified":"2025-12-21T06:44:25.000111Z","details":"AVideo versions 14.3.1 prior to 20.1 contain an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability caused by predictable generation of an installation salt using PHP uniqid(). The installation timestamp is exposed via a public endpoint, and a derived hash identifier is accessible through unauthenticated API responses, allowing attackers to brute-force the remaining entropy. The recovered salt can then be used to encrypt a malicious payload supplied to a notification API endpoint that evaluates attacker-controlled input, resulting in arbitrary code execution as the web server user.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wwbn/avideo","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4a53ab2"},{"fixed":"a2bdbff"}]}],"versions":["10.4","10.8","11","11.1","11.1.1","11.5","11.6","12.4","14.3","14.3.1","14.4","18.0","2.2","2.4","2.7","3.4","3.4.1","4.0","4.0.1","4.0.2","5.0","6.5","7.2","7.3","7.4","7.5","7.6","7.7","7.8","8.1","8.5","8.6","8.7","8.9","8.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-34433.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://chocapikk.com/posts/2025/avideo-security-vulnerabilities/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/avideo-unauthenticated-rce-via-predictable-installation-salt"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/WWBN/AVideo/commit/4a53ab2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/WWBN/AVideo/commit/a2bdbff"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}]}
