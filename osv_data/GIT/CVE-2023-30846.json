{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-30846","published":"2023-04-26T20:58:02.940Z","modified":"2025-12-04T23:49:42.449937Z","aliases":["GHSA-558p-m34m-vpmq"],"summary":"typed-rest-client vulnerable to potential leak of authentication data to 3rd parties","details":"typed-rest-client is a library for Node Rest and Http Clients with typings for use with TypeScript. Users of the typed-rest-client library version 1.7.3 or lower are vulnerable to leak authentication data to 3rd parties. The flow of the vulnerability is as follows: First, send any request with `BasicCredentialHandler`, `BearerCredentialHandler` or `PersonalAccessTokenCredentialHandler`. Second, the target host may return a redirection (3xx), with a link to a second host. Third, the next request will use the credentials to authenticate with the second host, by setting the `Authorization` header. The expected behavior is that the next request will *NOT* set the `Authorization` header. The problem was fixed in version 1.8.0. There are no known workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/microsoft/typed-rest-client","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5fcb9c0945378d3a7463837c9716fb1f8257efe1"}]}],"versions":["1.0.6","1.0.7","1.4.0","1.5.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-30846.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/30xxx/CVE-2023-30846.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/typed-rest-client/commit/f9ff755631b982ee1303dfc3e3c823d0d31233e8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/typed-rest-client/security/advisories/GHSA-558p-m34m-vpmq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30846"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230601-0008/"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-522"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/30xxx/CVE-2023-30846.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
