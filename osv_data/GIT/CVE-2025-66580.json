The application allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript via `javascript:`. An attacker can exploit this to inject a malicious Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configuration, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the victim's machine when the node is clicked. Version 0.11.1 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openagentplatform/dive","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"22496a9868e2a956f861cd9d39875ee308674a92"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.10.0","v0.10.1","v0.11.0","v0.2.0","v0.2.1","v0.3.0","v0.3.1","v0.3.2","v0.4.0","v0.5.0","v0.5.1","v0.6.0","v0.6.1","v0.6.2","v0.6.3","v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.7.2","v0.7.3","v0.7.4","v0.7.5","v0.7.6","v0.7.7","v0.7.8","v0.7.9","v0.8.0","v0.8.1","v0.8.2","v0.8.3","v0.8.4","v0.8.5","v0.8.6","v0.8.7","v0.8.8","v0.8.9-rc.1","v0.9.0","v0.9.1","v0.9.10","v0.9.11","v0.9.2","v0.9.3","v0.9.4","v0.9.5","v0.9.6","v0.9.7","v0.9.8","v0.9.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66580.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66580.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/OpenAgentPlatform/Dive/security/advisories/GHSA-xv8m-365j-x6h2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66580"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-94"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66580.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
