This may allow a man-in-the-middle to pose as other peers and get those peers banned. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.2 or 5.0.3 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/chainsafe/js-libp2p-noise","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"fe306a6992d7199bf90654e86664f41304b0da67"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.2"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/chainsafe/js-libp2p-noise","events":[{"introduced":"6dd8492e8cecbe8a55cf55845a789b809d3529ac"},{"fixed":"790b039023c72005536831a3ab6ab16a04645883"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"5.0.0"},{"fixed":"5.0.3"}]}}],"versions":["v5.0.0","v5.0.1","v5.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24759.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/24xxx/CVE-2022-24759.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ChainSafe/js-libp2p-noise/pull/130"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ChainSafe/js-libp2p-noise/releases/tag/v5.0.3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ChainSafe/js-libp2p-noise/security/advisories/GHSA-j3ff-xp6c-6gcc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24759"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-347"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/24xxx/CVE-2022-24759.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}]}
