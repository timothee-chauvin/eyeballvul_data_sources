  "details": "Netatalk before 3.2.1 has an off-by-one error, and resultant heap-based buffer overflow and segmentation violation, because of incorrectly using FPLoginExt in BN_bin2bn in etc/uams/uams_dhx_pam.c. The original issue 1097 report stated: 'The latest version of Netatalk (v3.2.0) contains a security vulnerability. This vulnerability arises due to a lack of validation for the length field after parsing user-provided data, leading to an out-of-bounds heap write of one byte (\\0). Under specific configurations, this can result in reading metadata of the next heap block, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS) under certain heap layouts or with ASAN enabled. ... The vulnerability is located in the FPLoginExt operation of Netatalk, in the BN_bin2bn function found in /etc/uams/uams_dhx_pam.c ... if (!(bn = BN_bin2bn((unsigned char *)ibuf, KEYSIZE, NULL))) ... threads ...
