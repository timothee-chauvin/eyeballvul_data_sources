Prior to version 0.48.0, Omni Wireguard SideroLink has the potential to escape. Omni and each Talos machine establish a peer-to-peer (P2P) SideroLink connection using WireGuard to mutually authenticate and authorize access. The WireGuard interface on Omni is configured to ensure that the source IP address of an incoming packet matches the IPv6 address assigned to the Talos peer. However, it performs no validation on the packet's destination address. The Talos end of the SideroLink connection cannot be considered a trusted environment. Workloads running on Kubernetes, especially those configured with host networking, could gain direct access to this link. Therefore, a malicious workload could theoretically send arbitrary packets over the SideroLink interface. This issue has been patched in version 0.48.0.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/siderolabs/omni","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a78bad1b70fee2c58a28ac85b1701f6b2ca0f273"}]}],"versions":["client/v0.48.0-beta.0","v0.33.0-beta.0","v0.34.0-beta.0","v0.35.0-beta.0","v0.36.0-beta.0","v0.37.0-beta.0","v0.38.0-beta.0","v0.39.0-beta.0","v0.40.0-beta.0","v0.41.0-beta.0","v0.42.0-beta.0","v0.43.0","v0.43.0-beta.0","v0.44.0-beta.0","v0.45.0-beta.0","v0.46.0-beta.0","v0.47.0-beta.0","v0.47.0-beta.1","v0.48.0-beta.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-59824.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/siderolabs/omni/security/advisories/GHSA-hqrf-67pm-wgfq"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/siderolabs/omni/commit/a5efd816a239e6c9e5ea7c0d43c02c04504d7b60"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-863"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}]}
