However, the code\nthat checks for available space in the skb is flawed:\n'''\ncopy = size_goal - skb->len\n'''\n\nThe types of the variables involved are:\n'''\ncopy: ssize_t (s64 on 64-bit systems)\nsize_goal: int\nskb->len: unsigned int\n'''\n\nDue to C's type promotion rules, the signed size_goal is converted to an\nunsigned int to match skb->len before the subtraction. The result is an\nunsigned int.\n\nWhen this unsigned int result is then assigned to the s64 copy variable,\nit is zero-extended, preserving its non-negative value. Consequently, copy\nis always >= 0.\n\nAssume we are sending 2GB of data and size_goal has been adjusted to a\nvalue smaller than skb->len. The subtraction will result in copy holding a\nvery large positive integer. In the subsequent logic, this large value is\nused to update sk->sk_forward_alloc, which can easily cause it to overflow.\n\nThe syzkaller reproducer uses TCP_REPAIR to reliably create this\ncondition. However, this can also occur in real-world scenarios. The\ntcp_bound_to_half_wnd() function can also reduce size_goal to a small\nvalue. This would cause the subsequent tcp_wmem_schedule() to set\nsk->sk_forward_alloc to a value close to INT_MAX. Further memory\nallocation requests would then cause sk_forward_alloc to wrap around and\nbecome negative.\n\n[1]: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=de6565462ab540f50e47","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"270a1c3de47e49dd2fc18f48e46b101e48050e78"},{"fixed":"81373cd1d72d87c7d844d4454a526b8f53e72d00"},{"fixed":"62e6160cfb5514787bda833d466509edc38fde23"},{"fixed":"9f164fa6bb09fbcc60fa5c3ff551ce9eec1befd7"},{"fixed":"d3a5f2871adc0c61c61869f37f3e697d97f03d8c"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.15.1","v6.15.2","v6.15.3","v6.15.4","v6.15.5","v6.15.6","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.4","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.5","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.59","v6.6.6","v6.6.60","v6.6.61","v6.6.62","v6.6.63","v6.6.64","v6.6.65","v6.6.66","v6.6.67","v6.6.68","v6.6.69","v6.6.7","v6.6.70","v6.6.71","v6.6.72","v6.6.73","v6.6.74","v6.6.75","v6.6.76","v6.6.77","v6.6.78","v6.6.79","v6.6.8","v6.6.80","v6.6.81","v6.6.82","v6.6.83","v6.6.84","v6.6.85","v6.6.86","v6.6.87","v6.6.88","v6.6.89","v6.6.9","v6.6.90","v6.6.91","v6.6.92","v6.6.93","v6.6.94","v6.6.95","v6.6.96","v6.6.97","v6.6.98","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38463.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.5.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.99"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.39"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.15.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-38463.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/62e6160cfb5514787bda833d466509edc38fde23"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/81373cd1d72d87c7d844d4454a526b8f53e72d00"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9f164fa6bb09fbcc60fa5c3ff551ce9eec1befd7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d3a5f2871adc0c61c61869f37f3e697d97f03d8c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/38xxx/CVE-2025-38463.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38463"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/38xxx/CVE-2025-38463.json"}}
