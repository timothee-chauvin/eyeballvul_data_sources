Prior to versions `0.3.3+8.13.9` and `0.2.5+8.11.3`, the phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a panic-guarded out-of-bounds access on the phonenumber string. In a typical deployment of `rust-phonenumber`, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber over the network, specifically the string `.;phone-context=`. Versions `0.3.3+8.13.9` and `0.2.5+8.11.3` contain a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bea8e732b9cada617ede5cf51663dba183747f71"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-42444.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/commit/2dd44be94539c051b4dee55d1d9d349bd7bedde6"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/commit/bea8e732b9cada617ede5cf51663dba183747f71"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/security/advisories/GHSA-whhr-7f2w-qqj2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1284","CWE-248","CWE-392"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
