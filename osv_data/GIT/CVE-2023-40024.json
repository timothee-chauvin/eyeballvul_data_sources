{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-40024","published":"2023-08-14T19:53:24Z","modified":"2025-10-22T18:40:10.979397Z","aliases":["GHSA-6xcx-gx7r-rccj"],"summary":"Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in scancode.io license endpoint","details":"ScanCode.io is a server to script and automate software composition analysis pipelines. In the `/license/` endpoint, the detailed view key is not properly validated and sanitized, which can result in a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when attempting to access a detailed license view that does not exist. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the response generated by the `license_details_view` function. When unsuspecting users visit the page, their browsers will execute the injected scripts, leading to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or stealing sensitive information. This issue has been addressed in release `32.5.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/nexb/scancode.io","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"9a698e87f25c775c1114e6132ef84cf2c35449f9"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.1.0","21.4.5","v21.4.14","v21.4.28","v21.5.12","v21.6.10","v21.8.2","v21.9.6","v30.0.0","v30.0.1","v30.1.0","v30.1.1","v30.2.0","v31.0.0","v32.0.0","v32.0.1","v32.1.0","v32.2.0","v32.3.0","v32.4.0","v32.5.0","v32.5.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-40024.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/security/advisories/GHSA-6xcx-gx7r-rccj"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/blob/dd7769fbc97c84545579cebf1dc4838214098a11/CHANGELOG.rst#v3252-2023-08-14"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
