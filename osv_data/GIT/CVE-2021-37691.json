In affected versions an attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a division by zero error in LSH [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/149562d49faa709ea80df1d99fc41d005b81082a/tensorflow/lite/kernels/lsh_projection.cc#L118). We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 0575b640091680cfb70f4dd93e70658de43b94f9. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.
