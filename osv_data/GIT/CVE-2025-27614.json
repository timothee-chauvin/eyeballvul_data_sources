Starting with 2.41.0, a Git repository can be crafted in such a way that with some social engineering a user who has cloned the repository can be tricked into running any script (e.g., Bourne shell, Perl, Python, ...) supplied by the attacker by invoking gitk filename, where filename has a particular structure. The script is run with the privileges of the user. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.43.7, 2.44.4, 2.45.4, 2.46.4, 2.47.3, 2.48.2, 2.49.1, and 2.50.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/j6t/gitk","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8e3070aa5e331be45d4d03e3be41f84494fce129"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27614.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/07/08/4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/27xxx/CVE-2025-27614.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/j6t/gitk/commit/8e3070aa5e331be45d4d03e3be41f84494fce129"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/j6t/gitk/security/advisories/GHSA-g4v5-fjv9-mhhc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27614"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-78"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/27xxx/CVE-2025-27614.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
