Before version 0.1.3 `update_by_case` gem used custom sql strings, and it was not sanitized, making it vulnerable to sql injection. Upgrade to version >= 0.1.3 that uses `Arel` instead to construct the resulting sql statement, with sanitized sql.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/camilova/activerecord-update-by-case","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"31c44b7837537121cc43cb2f896954fe115d1d06"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.2-stable"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-35956.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/camilova/activerecord-update-by-case/releases/tag/v0.1.3-stable"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/camilova/activerecord-update-by-case/security/advisories/GHSA-33wh-w4m7-c6r8"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-89"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
