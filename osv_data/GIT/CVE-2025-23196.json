  "details": "A code injection vulnerability exists in the Ambari Alert Definition \nfeature, allowing authenticated users to inject and execute arbitrary \nshell commands. The vulnerability arises when defining alert scripts, \nwhere the script filename field is executed using `sh -c`. An attacker \nwith authenticated access can exploit this vulnerability to inject \nmalicious commands, leading to remote code execution on the server. The \nissue has been fixed in the latest versions of Ambari.",
