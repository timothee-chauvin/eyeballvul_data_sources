{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-40251","published":"2025-12-04T16:08:13.710Z","modified":"2025-12-05T12:36:07.714145Z","summary":"devlink: rate: Unset parent pointer in devl_rate_nodes_destroy","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndevlink: rate: Unset parent pointer in devl_rate_nodes_destroy\n\nThe function devl_rate_nodes_destroy is documented to \"Unset parent for\nall rate objects\". However, it was only calling the driver-specific\n`rate_leaf_parent_set` or `rate_node_parent_set` ops and decrementing\nthe parent's refcount, without actually setting the\n`devlink_rate->parent` pointer to NULL.\n\nThis leaves a dangling pointer in the `devlink_rate` struct, which cause\nrefcount error in netdevsim[1] and mlx5[2]. In addition, this is\ninconsistent with the behavior of `devlink_nl_rate_parent_node_set`,\nwhere the parent pointer is correctly cleared.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by explicitly setting `devlink_rate->parent`\nto NULL after notifying the driver, thus fulfilling the function's\ndocumented behavior for all rate objects.\n\n[1]\nrepro steps:\necho 1 >
