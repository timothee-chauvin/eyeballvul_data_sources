Unfortunately both\ncallbacks have the very same form, and the compiler didn't complain\nit, either.  This resulted in a NULL dereference because the PCM\ninstance hasn't been initialized at calling the build_controls\ncallback.\n\nFix it by passing the proper entries.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ad781b550f9a8829e3dae4bd3d18c4a126a53d04"},{"fixed":"d2aed6fac1148528181affb781aa683d6569042b"},{"fixed":"82420bd4e17bdaba8453fbf9e10c58c9ed0c9727"}]}],"versions":["v6.16","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68205.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68205.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/82420bd4e17bdaba8453fbf9e10c58c9ed0c9727"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d2aed6fac1148528181affb781aa683d6569042b"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68205.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68205"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68205.json"}}
