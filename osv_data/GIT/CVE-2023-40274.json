The custom implementation of a web server, available via the \"zola serve\" command, allows directory traversal. The handle_request function, used by the server to process HTTP requests, does not account for sequences of special path control characters (../) in the URL when serving a file, which allows one to escape the webroot of the server and read arbitrary files from the filesystem.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/getzola/zola","events":[{"introduced":"1ef8c85f53b4988fdafc0e6271cce590515d55aa"},{"last_affected":"7c6bdc1019dbfa1c59667dd6ba0cacf30774b41b"}]}],"versions":["v0.13.0","v0.14.0","v0.14.1","v0.15.0","v0.15.1","v0.15.3","v0.16.0","v0.16.1","v0.17.0","v0.17.1","v0.17.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-40274.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/getzola/zola/issues/2257"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/getzola/zola/pull/2258"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
