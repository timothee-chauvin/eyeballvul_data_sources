{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68318","published":"2025-12-16T15:39:47.965Z","modified":"2026-01-02T22:07:41.726911Z","summary":"clk: thead: th1520-ap: set all AXI clocks to CLK_IS_CRITICAL","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: thead: th1520-ap: set all AXI clocks to CLK_IS_CRITICAL\n\nThe AXI crossbar of TH1520 has no proper timeout handling, which means\ngating AXI clocks can easily lead to bus timeout and thus system hang.\n\nSet all AXI clock gates to CLK_IS_CRITICAL. All these clock gates are\nungated by default on system reset.\n\nIn addition, convert all current CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED usage to\nCLK_IS_CRITICAL to prevent unwanted clock gating.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ae81b69fd2b1eb4885b352749b1fd1172e2f0f18"},{"fixed":"bdec5e01fc2f3114d1fb1daeb1000911d783c4ae"},{"fixed":"c567bc5fc68c4388c00e11fc65fd14fe86b52070"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68318.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.11.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68318.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bdec5e01fc2f3114d1fb1daeb1000911d783c4ae"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c567bc5fc68c4388c00e11fc65fd14fe86b52070"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68318.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68318"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68318.json"}}
