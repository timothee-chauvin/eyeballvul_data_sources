On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-patreon","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-39355.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-patreon/security/advisories/GHSA-fvj9-f67v-qpr4"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/discourse/discourse-patreon/commit/846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}]}
