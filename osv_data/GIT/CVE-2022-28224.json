Due to insufficient validation, a privileged attacker may be able to set a floating IP annotation to a pod even if the feature is not enabled. This may allow the attacker to intercept and reroute traffic to their compromised pod.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/projectcalico/calico","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0337a6efbfe8e220be55dc3c8483a1790add0724"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-28224.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.tigera.io/security-bulletins-tta-2022-001/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H"}]}
