  "details": "DHIS 2 is an open source information system for data capture, management, validation, analytics and visualization. Through various features of DHIS2, an authenticated user may be able to upload a file which includes embedded javascript. The user could then potentially trick another authenticated user to open the malicious file in a browser which would trigger the javascript code, resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. DHIS2 administrators should upgrade to the following hotfix releases: 2.36.12.1, 2.37.8.1, 2.38.2.1, 2.39.0.1. Users unable to upgrade may add the following simple CSP rule in your web proxy to the vulnerable endpoints: `script-src 'none'`. This workaround will prevent all javascript from running on those endpoints.",
