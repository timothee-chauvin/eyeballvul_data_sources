{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-41434","published":"2024-09-03T20:15:07Z","modified":"2025-10-21T23:35:37.809134Z","details":"PingCAP TiDB v8.1.0 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow via the component (*Column).GetDecimal. This allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted input to the 'RemoveUnnecessaryFirstRow', it will check the expression between 'Agg' and 'GroupBy', but does not check the return type. NOTE: PingCAP disputes this, arguing that reproduction did not cause the security impact of service interruption to other users. They maintain it is a complex query bug in the product but not a DoS.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/pingcap/tidb","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"945d07c5d5c7a1ae212f6013adfb187f2de24b23"}]}],"versions":["Beta20160630","Beta20160730","Pre-GA","beta4","rc1","rc2","rc2-preview","rc3","rc4","v1.0.0","v1.1.0-alpha","v1.1.0-alpha.1","v1.1.0-beta","v2.0.0-rc.1","v2.0.0-rc.3","v2.0.0-rc.4","v2.1.0-alpha","v2.1.0-beta","v2.1.0-rc.1","v2.1.0-rc.2","v2.1.0-rc.3","v3.0.0-beta","v3.0.0-beta.1","v3.0.0-rc.1","v4.0.0-alpha","v4.0.0-beta","v4.0.0-beta.2","v5.1.0-alpha","v5.2.0-alpha","v5.3.0-alpha","v5.4.0-alpha","v5.5.0-alpha","v6.0.0-alpha","v6.1.0-alpha","v6.2.0-alpha","v6.3.0-alpha","v6.4.0-alpha","v6.5.0-alpha","v6.6.0-alpha","v6.7.0-alpha","v7.1.0-alpha","v7.2.0-alpha","v7.3.0-alpha","v7.4.0-alpha","v7.5.0-alpha","v7.6.0-alpha","v8.0.0-alpha","v8.1.0","v8.1.0-alpha"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-41434.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://gist.github.com/ycybfhb/4aa6809695b9e8a1cd1429e597c17517"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/53733"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}]}
