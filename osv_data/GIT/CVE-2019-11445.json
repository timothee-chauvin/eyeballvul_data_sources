As a result, attackers can gain remote code execution through the application server with root privileges.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/openkm/document-management-system","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3fc09ed828680c48d5a133fd6becbf7cd8c447b2"}]}],"versions":["v6.3.3","v6.3.4","v6.3.5","v6.3.6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-11445.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://pentest.com.tr/exploits/OpenKM-DM-6-3-7-Remote-Command-Execution-Metasploit.html"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46526"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
