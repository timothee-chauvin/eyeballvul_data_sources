{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-51987","published":"2024-11-07T23:36:16.989Z","modified":"2025-11-20T06:13:22.899602Z","aliases":["GHSA-7mr7-4f54-vcx5"],"summary":"HTTP Client uses incorrect token after refresh in Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect","details":"Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect is a set of .NET libraries that manage OAuth and OpenId Connect access tokens. HTTP Clients created by `AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient` may use a different user's access token after a token refresh occurs. This occurs because a refreshed token will be captured in pooled `HttpClient` instances, which may be used by a different user. Instead of using `AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient` to create an `HttpClient` that automatically adds a managed token to outgoing requests, you can use the `HttpConext.GetUserAccessTokenAsync` extension method or the `IUserTokenManagementService.GetAccessTokenAsync` method. This issue is fixed in Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect 3.0.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/duendesoftware/duende.accesstokenmanagement","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"b0f2ac089375cecaf7c2f3f83bb52af6ded0e54a"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"= 3.0.0"}]}}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.0-preview.1","1.0.0-preview.2","1.0.0-preview.3","1.0.0-preview.4","1.0.0-preview.5","1.1.0","2.0.0","2.0.0-preview.1","2.0.0-preview.1.1","2.0.0-preview.1.2","2.0.0-preview.1.3","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.1.0","2.1.0-preview.1","2.1.1","2.1.2","3.0.0","3.0.0-preview.1","3.0.0-preview.2","3.0.0-preview.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-51987.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/Duende.AccessTokenManagement/security/advisories/GHSA-7mr7-4f54-vcx5"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-270"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
