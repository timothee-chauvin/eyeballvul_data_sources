Prior to version 2.0.43, an unauthenticated user can retrieve Prometheus metrics from a publicly reachable Miniflux instance where the `METRICS_COLLECTOR` configuration option is enabled and `METRICS_ALLOWED_NETWORKS` is set to `127.0.0.1/8` (the default). A patch is available in Miniflux 2.0.43. As a workaround, set `METRICS_COLLECTOR` to `false` (default) or run Miniflux behind a trusted reverse-proxy.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/miniflux/v2","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"ab209df78f41cfd2e3b273682e29c492351575d1"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0","2.0.0-rc1","2.0.1","2.0.10","2.0.11","2.0.12","2.0.13","2.0.14","2.0.15","2.0.16","2.0.17","2.0.18","2.0.19","2.0.2","2.0.20","2.0.21","2.0.22","2.0.23","2.0.24","2.0.25","2.0.26","2.0.27","2.0.28","2.0.29","2.0.3","2.0.30","2.0.31","2.0.32","2.0.33","2.0.34","2.0.35","2.0.36","2.0.37","2.0.38","2.0.39","2.0.4","2.0.40","2.0.41","2.0.42","2.0.5","2.0.6","2.0.7","2.0.8","2.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-27591.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/miniflux/v2/pull/1745"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/miniflux/v2/releases/tag/2.0.43"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/miniflux/v2/security/advisories/GHSA-3qjf-qh38-x73v"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://miniflux.app/docs/configuration.html#metrics-collector"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1220","CWE-200"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}]}
