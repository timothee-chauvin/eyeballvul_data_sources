This could lead to a null pointer\ndereference if 'dc_dmub_srv' is null. The fix is to check if\n'dc_dmub_srv' is null before dereferencing it.\n\nThus moving the null checks for 'dc_dmub_srv' to the beginning of the\nfunctions to ensure that 'dc_dmub_srv' is not null when it is\ndereferenced.\n\nFound by smatch & thus fixing the below:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dc_dmub_srv.c:133 dc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() warn: variable dereferenced before check 'dc_dmub_srv' (see line 128)\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dc_dmub_srv.c:1167 dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up() warn: variable dereferenced before check 'dc_dmub_srv' (see line 1164)","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"65138eb72e1fc687be49932b9a45325598ffa01c"},{"fixed":"351080ba3414c96afff0f1338b4aeb2983195b80"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"65138eb72e1fc687be49932b9a45325598ffa01c"},{"fixed":"d2b48f340d9e4a8fbeb1cdc84cd8da6ad143a907"}]}],"versions":["v6.5","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.7.1","v6.7.2","v6.7.3","v6.7.4","v6.7.5","v6.7.6","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-26729.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.7.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-26729.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/351080ba3414c96afff0f1338b4aeb2983195b80"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d2b48f340d9e4a8fbeb1cdc84cd8da6ad143a907"}]}
