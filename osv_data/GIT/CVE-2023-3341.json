Recursion depth is only limited by the maximum accepted packet size; depending on the environment, this may cause the packet-parsing code to run out of available stack memory, causing `named` to terminate unexpectedly. Since each incoming control channel message is fully parsed before its contents are authenticated, exploiting this flaw does not require the attacker to hold a valid RNDC key; only network access to the control channel's configured TCP port is necessary.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.2.0 through 9.16.43, 9.18.0 through 9.18.18, 9.19.0 through 9.19.16, 9.9.3-S1 through 9.16.43-S1, and 9.18.0-S1 through 9.18.18-S1.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/isc-projects/bind9","events":[{"introduced":"8db45afa1affcb823e68afdeddedf93e136f5d3e"},{"fixed":"c78cd3681c406955961d0b3c67ab6da7c6043aa8"}]}],"versions":["v9.18.0","v9.18.10","v9.18.11","v9.18.12","v9.18.13","v9.18.14","v9.18.15","v9.18.16","v9.18.17","v9.18.18","v9.18.2","v9.18.3","v9.18.4","v9.18.5","v9.18.6","v9.18.7","v9.18.8","v9.18.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-3341.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/bind9","events":[{"introduced":"fd212b709580a72a8e168b632d7dc863e61a14e4"},{"fixed":"cd2b4602b03027790908c2870b8a42c0870de489"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-3341.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-3341"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00021.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VSK5V4W4OHPM3JTJGWAQD6CZW7SFD75B/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231013-0003/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5504"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/20/2"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IPJLLTJCSDJJII7IIZPLTBQNWP7MZH7F/"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U35OARLQCPMVCBBPHWBXY5M6XJLD2TZ5/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
