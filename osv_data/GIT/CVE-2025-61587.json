{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-61587","published":"2025-10-01T22:01:00Z","modified":"2025-10-31T04:20:21.501031Z","aliases":["GHSA-3xhv-r4gx-xw99"],"summary":"Weblate integration with Anubis can lead to Open Redirect via redir parameter","details":"Weblate is a web based localization tool. An open redirect exists in versions 5.13.2 and below via the redir parameter on .within.website when Weblate is configured with Anubis and REDIRECT_DOMAINS is not set. An attacker can craft a URL on the legitimate domain that redirects a victim to an attacker-controlled site. The redirect can also be used to initiate drive-by downloads (redirecting to a URL that serves a malicious file), increasing the risk to end users. This issue is fixed in version 5.13.3.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/weblateorg/docker","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"76518342f65b8af8c2b7f7c5d37f84813c1253a1"}]}],"versions":["2.10-1","2.10.1-1","2.11-1","2.11-2","2.12-1","2.12-2","2.12-3","2.13.1-1","2.13.1-2","2.14-1","2.14.1-1","2.14.1-2","2.15-1","2.15-2","2.16-1","2.16-2","2.17.1-1","2.17.1-2","2.18-1","2.18-2","2.18-3","2.19-1","2.19.1-1","2.19.1-2","2.19.1-3","2.20-1","2.20-2","2.20-3","2.20-4","2.20-5","2.8-1","2.8-2","2.9-1","2.9-2","2.9-3","3.0-1","3.0.1-1","3.0.1-2","3.0.1-3","3.0.1-4","3.0.1-5","3.0.1-6","3.0.1-7","3.1.1-1","3.1.1-2","3.1.1-3","3.1.1-4","3.1.1-5","3.1.1-6","3.10-1","3.10.1-1","3.10.1-2","3.10.3-1","3.11-1","3.11.1-1","3.11.2-1","3.11.3-1","3.2-1","3.2.1-1","3.2.1-2","3.2.2-1","3.2.2-2","3.2.2-3","3.2.2-4","3.2.2-5","3.3-1","3.3-2","3.3-3","3.3-4","3.3-5","3.4-1","3.4-2","3.4-3","3.4-4","3.5-1","3.5.1-1","3.5.1-2","3.6-1","3.6.1-1","3.6.1-2","3.7-1","3.7-2","3.7-3","3.7.1-1","3.7.1-2","3.7.1-3","3.7.1-4","3.7.1-5","3.7.1-6","3.7.1-7","3.7.1-8","3.8-1","3.8-2","3.8-3","3.8-4","3.8-5","3.9-1","3.9.1-1","3.9.1-2","3.9.1-3","4.0.1-1","4.0.2-1","4.0.3-1","4.0.4-1","4.0.4-2","4.0.4-3","4.0.4-4","4.0.4-5","4.1-1","4.1-2","4.1.1-1","4.1.1-2","4.1.1-3","4.10-1","4.10.1-1","4.11-1","4.11.2-1","4.12-1","4.12.1-1","4.12.2-1","4.12.2-2","4.13-1","4.13.1-1","4.13.1-2","4.14-1","4.14.1-1","4.14.2-1","4.15-1","4.15.1-1","4.15.2-1","4.15.2-2","4.15.2-3","4.16.1-1","4.16.2-1","4.16.2-2","4.16.4-1","4.16.4-2","4.17-1","4.17-2","4.17.0.3","4.18.0.1","4.18.1.1","4.18.2.1","4.18.2.2","4.2-1","4.2.1-1","4.2.1-2","4.2.2-1","4.2.2-2","4.2.2-3","4.2.2-4","4.3-1","4.3.1-1","4.3.2-1","4.4-1","4.4.1-1","4.4.2-1","4.4.2-2","4.5-1","4.5.1-1","4.5.2-1","4.5.3-1","4.5.3-2","4.5.3-3","4.6-1","4.6.1-1","4.6.1-2","4.6.2-1","4.6.2-2","4.7-1","4.7.1-1","4.7.2-1","4.8-1","4.8.1-1","4.8.1-2","4.8.1-3","4.9-1","4.9.1-1","5.0.0.1","5.0.0.2","5.0.1.1","5.0.2.1","5.0.2.2","5.1.0.1","5.1.0.2","5.1.1.1","5.1.1.2","5.1.1.3","5.10.0.0","5.10.1.0","5.10.2.0","5.10.3.0","5.10.4.0","5.11.0.0","5.11.1.0","5.11.1.1","5.11.3.0","5.11.4.0","5.11.4.1","5.11.4.2","5.11.4.3","5.11.4.4","5.11.4.5","5.11.4.6","5.11.4.7","5.12.1.0","5.12.2.0","5.12.2.1","5.12.2.2","5.12.2.3","5.13.0.0","5.13.0.1","5.13.1.0","5.13.2.0","5.13.3.0","5.13.3.1","5.13.3.2","5.2.0.1","5.2.1.1","5.3.0.1","5.3.1.1","5.4.0.1","5.4.1.1","5.4.2.1","5.4.3.1","5.4.3.2","5.5.0.1","5.5.2.1","5.5.3.1","5.5.5.1","5.6.0.0","5.6.1.0","5.6.2.0","5.7.0.0","5.7.1.0","5.7.2.1","5.7.2.2","5.8.1.0","5.8.2.0","5.8.3.0","5.8.3.1","5.8.4.0","5.8.4.1","5.9.1.0","5.9.2.0","5.9.2.1","5.9.2.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-61587.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/weblateorg/weblate","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6b3d73a310279b5630bca8cbd9ea0be28bc67b63"},{"fixed":"ec3b900f8a52c5c992d9e7014f09397e159ac381"}]}],"versions":["weblate-0.1","weblate-0.2","weblate-0.3","weblate-0.4","weblate-0.5","weblate-0.6","weblate-0.7","weblate-0.8","weblate-0.9","weblate-1.0","weblate-1.1","weblate-1.2","weblate-1.3","weblate-1.4","weblate-1.5","weblate-1.6","weblate-1.7","weblate-1.8","weblate-1.9","weblate-2.0","weblate-2.1","weblate-2.10","weblate-2.10.1","weblate-2.11","weblate-2.12","weblate-2.13","weblate-2.13.1","weblate-2.14","weblate-2.14.1","weblate-2.15","weblate-2.16","weblate-2.17","weblate-2.18","weblate-2.19","weblate-2.19.1","weblate-2.2","weblate-2.20","weblate-2.3","weblate-2.4","weblate-2.5","weblate-2.6","weblate-2.7","weblate-2.8","weblate-2.9","weblate-3.0","weblate-3.0.1","weblate-3.1","weblate-3.1.1","weblate-3.10","weblate-3.10.1","weblate-3.10.2","weblate-3.10.3","weblate-3.11","weblate-3.11.1","weblate-3.11.2","weblate-3.11.3","weblate-3.2","weblate-3.2.1","weblate-3.2.2","weblate-3.3","weblate-3.4","weblate-3.5","weblate-3.5.1","weblate-3.6","weblate-3.6.1","weblate-3.7","weblate-3.7.1","weblate-3.8","weblate-3.9","weblate-3.9.1","weblate-4.0","weblate-4.0.1","weblate-4.0.2","weblate-4.0.3","weblate-4.0.4","weblate-4.1","weblate-4.1.1","weblate-4.10","weblate-4.10.1","weblate-4.11","weblate-4.11.1","weblate-4.11.2","weblate-4.12","weblate-4.12.1","weblate-4.12.2","weblate-4.13","weblate-4.13.1","weblate-4.14","weblate-4.14.1","weblate-4.14.2","weblate-4.15","weblate-4.15.1","weblate-4.15.2","weblate-4.16","weblate-4.16.1","weblate-4.16.2","weblate-4.16.3","weblate-4.16.4","weblate-4.17","weblate-4.18","weblate-4.18.1","weblate-4.18.2","weblate-4.2","weblate-4.2.1","weblate-4.2.2","weblate-4.3","weblate-4.3.1","weblate-4.3.2","weblate-4.4","weblate-4.4.1","weblate-4.4.2","weblate-4.5","weblate-4.5.1","weblate-4.5.2","weblate-4.5.3","weblate-4.6","weblate-4.6.1","weblate-4.6.2","weblate-4.7","weblate-4.7.1","weblate-4.7.2","weblate-4.8","weblate-4.8.1","weblate-4.9","weblate-4.9.1","weblate-5.0","weblate-5.0.1","weblate-5.0.2","weblate-5.1","weblate-5.1.1","weblate-5.10","weblate-5.10.1","weblate-5.10.2","weblate
