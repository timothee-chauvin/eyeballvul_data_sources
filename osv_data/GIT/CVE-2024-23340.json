  "details": "@hono/node-server is an adapter that allows users to run Hono applications on Node.js. Since v1.3.0, @hono/node-server has used its own Request object with `url` behavior that is unexpected. In the standard API, if the URL contains `..`, here called \"double dots\", the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path. However, the `url` in @hono/node-server's Request as does not resolve double dots, so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned. This causes vulnerabilities when using `serveStatic`. Modern web browsers and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side, so this issue doesn't affect those using either of those tools. However, problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them. Version 1.4.1 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround, don't use `serveStatic`.\n\n",
