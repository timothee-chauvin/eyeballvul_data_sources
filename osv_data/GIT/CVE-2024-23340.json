{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-23340","published":"2024-01-22T23:00:34.510Z","modified":"2025-12-05T03:13:13.186900Z","aliases":["GHSA-rjq5-w47x-x359"],"summary":"@hono/node-server can't handle \"double dots\" in URL","details":"@hono/node-server is an adapter that allows users to run Hono applications on Node.js. Since v1.3.0, @hono/node-server has used its own Request object with `url` behavior that is unexpected. In the standard API, if the URL contains `..`, here called \"double dots\", the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path. However, the `url` in @hono/node-server's Request as does not resolve double dots, so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned. This causes vulnerabilities when using `serveStatic`. Modern web browsers and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side, so this issue doesn't affect those using either of those tools. However, problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them. Version 1.4.1 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround, don't use `serveStatic`.\n\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/honojs/node-server","events":[{"introduced":"096e27d07a381eea47bbafc1278950ea0175713a"},{"fixed":"69dd54a0d547c7bccad7d4d365ef033740e3f365"}]}],"versions":["v1.3.0","v1.3.1","v1.3.2","v1.3.3","v1.3.4","v1.3.5","v1.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-23340.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/23xxx/CVE-2024-23340.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/honojs/node-server/blob/8cea466fd05e6d2e99c28011fc0e2c2d3f3397c9/src/request.ts#L43-L45"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/honojs/node-server/commit/dd9b9a9b23e3896403c90a740e7f1f0892feb402"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/honojs/node-server/security/advisories/GHSA-rjq5-w47x-x359"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23340"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/23xxx/CVE-2024-23340.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
