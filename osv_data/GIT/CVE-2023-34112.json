All the actions in the `bytedeco/javacpp-presets` use the `github.event.head_commit.message​` parameter in an insecure way. For example, the commit message is used in a run statement - resulting in a command injection vulnerability due to string interpolation. No exploitation has been reported. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.9. Users of JavaCPP Presets are advised to upgrade as a precaution.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"8a12398c14d846119e1ef016bf1d069bbd20751c"}]}],"versions":["0.10","0.11","0.6","0.7","0.8","0.9","1.0","1.1","1.2","1.3","1.4","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.4","1.5","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.4","1.5.5","1.5.6","1.5.7","1.5.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-34112.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/security/advisories/GHSA-36rx-hq22-jm5x"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}]}
