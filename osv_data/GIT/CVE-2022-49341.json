arm64: Clear prog->jited_len along prog->jited","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf, arm64: Clear prog->jited_len along prog->jited\n\nsyzbot reported an illegal copy_to_user() attempt\nfrom bpf_prog_get_info_by_fd() [1]\n\nThere was no repro yet on this bug, but I think\nthat commit 0aef499f3172 (\"mm/usercopy: Detect vmalloc overruns\")\nis exposing a prior bug in bpf arm64.\n\nbpf_prog_get_info_by_fd() looks at prog->jited_len\nto determine if the JIT image can be copied out to user space.\n\nMy theory is that syzbot managed to get a prog where prog->jited_len\nhas been set to 43, while prog->bpf_func has ben cleared.\n\nIt is not clear why copy_to_user(uinsns, NULL, ulen) is triggering\nthis particular warning.\n\nI thought find_vma_area(NULL) would not find a vm_struct.\nAs we do not hold vmap_area_lock spinlock, it might be possible\nthat the found vm_struct was garbage.\n\n[1]\nusercopy: Kernel memory exposure attempt
