Fix NULL dereference in error cleanup","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwatch_queue: Fix NULL dereference in error cleanup\n\nIn watch_queue_set_size(), the error cleanup code doesn't take account of\nthe fact that __free_page() can't handle a NULL pointer when trying to free\nup buffer pages that did get allocated.\n\nFix this by only calling __free_page() on the pages actually allocated.\n\nWithout the fix, this can lead to something like the following:\n\nBUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in __free_pages+0x1f/0x1b0
