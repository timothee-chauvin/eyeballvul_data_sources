The secret file stores the user's Planet API authentication information. It should only be accessible by the user, but before version 2.0.1, its permissions allowed the user's group and non-group to read the file as well. This issue was patched in version 2.0.1. As a workaround, set the secret file permissions to only user read/write by hand.\n","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"671c221fa09d5a448a698ae14dea9558f6596d2c"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2","0.0.3","0.0.4","0.0.5","0.0.6","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-32303.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/commit/d71415a83119c5e89d7b80d5f940d162376ee3b7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/releases/tag/2.0.1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/security/advisories/GHSA-j5fj-rfh6-qj85"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-732"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
