The module\ninitializes delayed work in case of gpios only and is only used if\ndebounce timer is not used, so make sure cancel_delayed_work_sync()\nis called only when its gpio-backed and debounce_use_hrtimer is false.\n\nThis fixes the issue seen below when the gpio_keys module is unloaded and\nan interrupt pin is used instead of GPIO:\n\n[  360.297569] ------------[ cut here
