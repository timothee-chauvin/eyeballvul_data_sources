{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-24904","published":"2022-05-20T13:55:11Z","modified":"2025-11-04T19:57:28.482246Z","aliases":["GHSA-6gcg-hp2x-q54h","GO-2022-0453"],"summary":"Symlink following allows leaking out-of-bound manifests and JSON files from Argo CD repo-server","details":"Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd","events":[{"introduced":"6fc345f555dff62d232fe03bf17b8bf84d7f1b5d"},{"fixed":"52f917a18165416baa418822daae36c5f011e91f"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"0.7.0"},{"fixed":"2.1.15"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd","events":[{"introduced":"6da92a8e8103ce4145bb0fe2b7e952be79c9ff0a"},{"fixed":"38755a4c1e5232aa2e6f80c062593c9f07da0757"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.2.0"},{"fixed":"2.2.9"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd","events":[{"introduced":"fe427802293b090f43f91f5839393174df6c3b3a"},{"fixed":"ac8b7df9467ffcc0920b826c62c4b603a7bfed24"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"2.3.0"},{"fixed":"2.3.4"}]}}],"versions":["v0.7.0","v0.7.1","v0.8.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.0-rc1","v2.1.0-rc2","v2.1.0-rc3","v2.1.1","v2.1.10","v2.1.11","v2.1.12","v2.1.13","v2.1.14","v2.1.2","v2.1.3","v2.1.4","v2.1.5","v2.1.6","v2.1.7","v2.1.8","v2.1.9","v2.2.0","v2.2.1","v2.2.2","v2.2.3","v2.2.4","v2.2.5","v2.2.6","v2.2.7","v2.2.8","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.3.2","v2.3.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-24904.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.1.15"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.2.9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.3.4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-6gcg-hp2x-q54h"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-59","CWE-61"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}]}
