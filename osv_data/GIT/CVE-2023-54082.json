{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-54082","published":"2025-12-24T13:06:14.011Z","modified":"2025-12-24T20:44:00.881299Z","summary":"af_unix: Fix null-ptr-deref in unix_stream_sendpage().","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naf_unix: Fix null-ptr-deref in unix_stream_sendpage().\n\nBing-Jhong Billy Jheng reported null-ptr-deref in unix_stream_sendpage()\nwith detailed analysis and a nice repro.\n\nunix_stream_sendpage() tries to add data to the last skb in the peer's\nrecv queue without locking the queue.\n\nIf the peer's FD is passed to another socket and the socket's FD is\npassed to the peer, there is a loop between them.  If we close both\nsockets without receiving FD, the sockets will be cleaned up by garbage\ncollection.\n\nThe garbage collection iterates such sockets and unlinks skb with\nFD from the socket's receive queue under the queue's lock.\n\nSo, there is a race where unix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb\nlocklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in\nuse-after-free.\n\nTo avoid the issue, unix_stream_sendpage() must lock the peer's recv\nqueue.\n\nNote the issue does not exist in 6.5+ thanks to the recent sendpage()\nrefactoring.\n\nThis patch is originally written by Linus Torvalds.\n\nBUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffff988004dd6870\nPF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\nPF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\nPGD 0
