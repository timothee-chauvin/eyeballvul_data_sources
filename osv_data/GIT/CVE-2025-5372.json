{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-5372","published":"2025-07-04T06:15:24.930Z","modified":"2025-11-26T09:09:35.867894Z","details":"A flaw was found in libssh versions built with OpenSSL versions older than 3.0, specifically in the ssh_kdf() function responsible for key derivation. Due to inconsistent interpretation of return values where OpenSSL uses 0 to indicate failure and libssh uses 0 for success—the function may mistakenly return a success status even when key derivation fails. This results in uninitialized cryptographic key buffers being used in subsequent communication, potentially compromising SSH sessions' confidentiality, integrity, and availability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://gitlab.com/libssh/libssh-mirror","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"dff6c0821ed54f6fbf5b755af43f54cbb723b1b1"}]}],"versions":["libssh-0.11.0","libssh-0.11.1","libssh-0.8.0","release-0-3-0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-5372.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:21977"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-5372"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2369388"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
