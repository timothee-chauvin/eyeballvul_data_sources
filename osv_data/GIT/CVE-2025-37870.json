However, in\nenable_streams, it is assumed that link training succeeded and the\nmux selects the phy clock, causing a hang when a register write is made.\n\n[How]\nWhen enable_stream is hit, check if link training failed. If it did, fall\nback to the ref clock to avoid a hang and keep the system in a recoverable\nstate.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"7462475e3a06fbb0b36243b391296f9f411e9041"},{"fixed":"0363c03672cd3191f037905bf981eb523a3b71b1"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"7462475e3a06fbb0b36243b391296f9f411e9041"},{"fixed":"04bf4f2a497e9877c425c5124652e61fb8a1a0aa"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"7462475e3a06fbb0b36243b391296f9f411e9041"},{"fixed":"8058061ed9d6bc259d1e678607b07d259342c08f"}]}],"versions":["v6.1","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.3","v6.12.4","v6.12.5","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.14.1","v6.14.2","v6.14.3","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-37870.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.3.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.25"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.14.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-37870.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0363c03672cd3191f037905bf981eb523a3b71b1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04bf4f2a497e9877c425c5124652e61fb8a1a0aa"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8058061ed9d6bc259d1e678607b07d259342c08f"}]}
