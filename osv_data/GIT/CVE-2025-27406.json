A vulnerability present in versions 0.10.0 through 1.0.2 allows to set up a template that allows to embed arbitrary Javascript. This enables the attacker to act on behalf of the user, if the template is being previewed; and act on behalf of the headless browser, if a report using the template is printed to PDF. This issue has been resolved in version 1.0.3 of Icinga Reporting. As a workaround, review all templates and remove suspicious settings.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/icinga/icingaweb2-module-reporting","events":[{"introduced":"3ff8aa4f4cc9eb14e33566b81627653a7b05d568"},{"fixed":"2eb28aa306dbf26c370990ec7e8ce89ae248c573"}]}],"versions":["v0.10.0","v1.0.0","v1.0.1","v1.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27406.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-reporting/security/advisories/GHSA-7qvq-54vm-r7hx"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-reporting/releases/tag/v1.0.3"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79","CWE-918"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
