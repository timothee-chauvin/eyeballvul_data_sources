Prior to version 3.3.0, when registering for an Agate account, arbitrary HTML code can be injected into a user's first and last name. This HTML is then rendered in the email sent to administrative users. The Agate service account sends this email and appears trustworthy, making this a significant risk for phishing attacks. Administrative users are impacted, as they can be targeted by unauthenticated users. Version 3.3.0 fixes the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/obiba/agate","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"a2b56e778c1ea6858c9f2b1fb0e766e1dfb7094e"}]}],"versions":["3.1.0","3.1.1","3.2.0","3.2.0-RC1","3.2.0-RC2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-27102.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/obiba/agate/security/advisories/GHSA-v3wj-7vj5-xj5v"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/obiba/agate/releases/tag/3.3.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N/E:P"}]}
