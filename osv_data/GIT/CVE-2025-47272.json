An attacker with temporary access to an authenticated session (e.g., on a shared/public machine) could permanently delete the user’s account without knowledge of the password. This bypass of re-authentication puts users at risk of account loss and data disruption. Version 1.1.0.3 contains a patch for the issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/ce-phoenixcart/phoenixcart","events":[{"introduced":"71ff16821bdbda52238b2276f094cbcdf4cba7d6"},{"fixed":"1c1c329923c42357cde210ec50859b1150740cbc"}]}],"versions":["v1.0.9.10","v1.0.9.7","v1.0.9.8","v1.0.9.9","v1.1.0.0","v1.1.0.1","v1.1.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-47272.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/CE-PhoenixCart/PhoenixCart/commit/e87162b15d31c4126acfc1aad6108e5b9955bb76"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CE-PhoenixCart/PhoenixCart/security/advisories/GHSA-62qj-pvwm-h8cv"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/47xxx/CVE-2025-47272.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47272"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-306"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/47xxx/CVE-2025-47272.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
