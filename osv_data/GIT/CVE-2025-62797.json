A critical Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the FluxCP-based website template used by multiple rAthena/Ragnarok servers. State-changing POST endpoints accept browser-initiated requests that are authorized solely by the session cookie without per-request anti-CSRF tokens or robust Origin/Referer validation. An attacker who can lure a logged-in user to an attacker-controlled page can cause that user to perform sensitive actions without their intent. This vulnerability is fixed with commit e3f130c.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/rathena/fluxcp","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"e3f130c4a2ccd615a3ee2ee0302ecbfbd84747e6"}]}],"versions":["v1.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-62797.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/rathena/FluxCP/security/advisories/GHSA-5w2g-8cqq-r4fr"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/rathena/FluxCP/commit/e3f130c4a2ccd615a3ee2ee0302ecbfbd84747e6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-352"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
