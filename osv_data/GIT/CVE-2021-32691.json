{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-32691","published":"2021-06-16T22:15:07.830Z","modified":"2025-11-20T11:46:23.768858Z","aliases":["GHSA-r578-pj6f-r4ff"],"related":["GHSA-r578-pj6f-r4ff"],"details":"Apollos Apps is an open source platform for launching church-related apps. In Apollos Apps versions prior to 2.20.0, new user registrations are able to access anyone's account by only knowing their basic profile information (name, birthday, gender, etc). This includes all app functionality within the app, as well as any authenticated links to Rock-based webpages (such as giving and events). There is a patch in version 2.20.0. As a workaround, one can patch one's server by overriding the `create` data source method on the `People` class.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apollosproject/apollos-apps","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1495867f88c35e8462842b7f09aad1fb29d896c4"},{"fixed":"cb5f8f1c0b24f1b215b2bb5eb6f9a8e16d728ce2"}]}],"versions":["rm","v","v0.8.5","v0.8.6","v1.0.0","v1.0.0-beta.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.0-beta.0","v1.1.0-beta.2","v1.1.0-beta.3","v1.2.0","v1.2.0-beta.0","v1.2.0-beta.1","v1.2.0-beta.2","v1.2.0-beta.3","v1.2.0-beta.4","v1.2.0-beta.5","v1.2.0-beta.6","v1.2.0-beta.7","v1.2.1","v1.2.2","v1.2.3","v1.2.4","v1.2.5","v1.3.0-beta.0","v1.3.0-beta.1","v1.3.0-beta.2","v1.3.0-beta.3","v1.3.0-beta.5","v1.3.0-beta.6","v1.4","v1.4.0","v1.4.3","v1.5","v1.5.0","v1.6","v1.6.0","v1.6.0-beta.0","v1.6.0-beta.1","v1.7","v1.7.0","v1.7.0-beta.1","v1.7.0-beta.2","v1.7.0-beta.3","v1.7.2","v1.8.0-beta.0","v2.0.0","v2.0.0-2.0.0-alpha.16.0","v2.0.0-beta.0","v2.0.0-beta.1","v2.0.0-beta.2","v2.0.0-beta.3","v2.0.0-beta.4","v2.0.1-canary.0","v2.1.0","v2.1.1","v2.10.0","v2.11.0","v2.12.0","v2.13.0","v2.13.1","v2.14.0","v2.15.0","v2.16.0","v2.17.0","v2.18.0","v2.18.1","v2.19.0","v2.2.0","v2.3.0","v2.3.1","v2.4.0","v2.5.0","v2.6.0","v2.7.0","v2.8.0","v2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-32691.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ApollosProject/apollos-apps/commit/cb5f8f1c0b24f1b215b2bb5eb6f9a8e16d728ce2"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/ApollosProject/apollos-apps/releases/tag/v2.20.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/ApollosProject/apollos-apps/security/advisories/GHSA-r578-pj6f-r4ff"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
