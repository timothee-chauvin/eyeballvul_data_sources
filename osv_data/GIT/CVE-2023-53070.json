This was needed to fetch LLC\ninformation from the PPTT in the cpuhotplug path which is executed in\nthe atomic context as the acpi_get_table() might sleep waiting for a\nmutex.\n\nHowever it missed to handle the case when there is no PPTT on the system\nwhich results in acpi_get_pptt() being called from all the secondary\nCPUs attempting to fetch the LLC information in the atomic context\nwithout knowing the absence of PPTT resulting in the splat like below:\n\n | BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/semaphore.c:164\n | in_atomic(): 1,
