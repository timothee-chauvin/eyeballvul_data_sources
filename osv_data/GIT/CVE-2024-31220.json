Starting in version 0.16.0 and prior to version 0.18.0, an attacker may be able to remotely read arbitrary files without authentication due to a path traversal vulnerability. Users who exposed the Sunshine configuration web user interface outside of localhost may be affected, depending on firewall configuration. To exploit vulnerability, attacker could make an http/s request to the `node_modules` endpoint if user exposed Sunshine config web server to internet or attacker is on the LAN. Version 0.18.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may block access to Sunshine via firewall.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/lizardbyte/sunshine","events":[{"introduced":"08d623ce44f77061a26de9dc50a2aef60f1b6158"},{"fixed":"b2c5da2cfca2ff503114c4ff51545c922098c4f3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-31220.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/releases/tag/v0.18.0"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/security/advisories/GHSA-6rg7-7m3w-w5wc"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"]},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}]}
