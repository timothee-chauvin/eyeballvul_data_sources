Prior to 0.0.16, due to a bug in sandboxing logic, sandbox-runtime did not properly enforce a network sandbox if the sandbox policy did not configure any allowed domains. This could allow sandboxed code to make network requests outside of the sandbox. A patch for this was released in v0.0.16.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"bea2930cc1db9c73a1b15acf6dc19c5261aec1f3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-66479.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66479.json"},{"type":"FIX","url":"https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime/commit/bea2930cc1db9c73a1b15acf6dc19c5261aec1f3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime/security/advisories/GHSA-9gqj-5w7c-vx47"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66479"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"GitHub_M","cwe_ids":["CWE-693"],"osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/66xxx/CVE-2025-66479.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
