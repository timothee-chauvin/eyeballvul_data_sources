  "details": "m1k1o/blog is a lightweight self-hosted facebook-styled PHP blog. Errors from functions `imagecreatefrom*` and `image*` have not been checked properly. Although PHP issued warnings and the upload function returned `false`, the original file (that could contain a malicious payload) was kept on the disk. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
