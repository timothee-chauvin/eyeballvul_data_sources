{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53768","published":"2025-12-08T01:19:31.353Z","modified":"2025-12-08T03:10:45.265104Z","summary":"regmap-irq: Fix out-of-bounds access when allocating config buffers","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nregmap-irq: Fix out-of-bounds access when allocating config buffers\n\nWhen allocating the 2D array for handling IRQ type registers in\nregmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode(), the intent is to allocate a matrix\nwith num_config_bases rows and num_config_regs columns.\n\nThis is currently handled by allocating a buffer to hold a pointer for\neach row (i.e. num_config_bases). After that, the logic attempts to\nallocate the memory required to hold the register configuration for\neach row. However, instead of doing this allocation for each row\n(i.e. num_config_bases allocations), the logic erroneously does this\nallocation num_config_regs number of times.\n\nThis scenario can lead to out-of-bounds accesses when num_config_regs\nis greater than num_config_bases. Fix this by updating the terminating\ncondition of the loop that allocates the memory for holding the register\nconfiguration to allocate memory only for each row in the matrix.\n\nAmit Pundir reported a crash that was occurring on his db845c device\ndue to memory corruption (see \"Closes\" tag for Amit's report). The KASAN\nreport below helped narrow it down to this issue:\n\n[   14.033877][    T1] ==================================================================\n[   14.042507][    T1] BUG: KASAN: invalid-access in regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode+0x594/0x1364\n[   14.050796][    T1] Write of size 8 at addr 06ffff8081021850 by task init/1\n\n[   14.242004][    T1] The buggy address belongs to the object at ffffff8081021850\n[   14.242004][    T1]  which belongs to the cache kmalloc-8 of size 8\n[   14.255669][    T1] The buggy address is located 0 bytes inside of\n[   14.255669][    T1]  8-byte region [ffffff8081021850, ffffff8081021858)","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"faa87ce9196dbb074d75bd4aecb8bacf18f19b4e"},{"fixed":"b1a726ad33e585e3d9fa70712df31ae105e4532c"},{"fixed":"6e7b2337ecd028bd888a1a0be4115b8a88faf838"},{"fixed":"963b54df82b6d6206d7def273390bf3f7af558e1"}]}],"versions":["v5.19","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.4.1","v6.4.2","v6.4.3","v6.4.4","v6.5-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53768.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.40"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53768.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6e7b2337ecd028bd888a1a0be4115b8a88faf838"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/963b54df82b6d6206d7def273390bf3f7af558e1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b1a726ad33e585e3d9fa70712df31ae105e4532c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53768.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53768"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53768.json"}}
