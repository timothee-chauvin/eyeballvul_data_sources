deleted simultaneously by both\np9_read_work and p9_fd_cancelled functions, but for the case where req->status\nequals REQ_STATUS_RCVD.\n\nUpdate the check for req->status in p9_fd_cancelled to skip processing not\njust received requests, but anything that is not SENT, as whatever\nchanged the state from SENT also removed the request from its list.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.\n\n[updated the check from status == RECV || status == ERROR to status !=
