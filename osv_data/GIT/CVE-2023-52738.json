But amdgpu seems to \"override\" the meaning of such\nfield - in the above oops for example, it was a GFX ring causing the crash, and\nthe sched.ready field was set to true in the ring init routine, regardless of\nthe state of the DRM scheduler. Hence, we ended-up using sched.ops as per\nChristian's suggestion [0], and also removed the no_scheduler check [1].\n\n[0]
