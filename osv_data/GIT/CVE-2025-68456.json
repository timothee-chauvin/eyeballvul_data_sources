In versions 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.20 and 3.0.0 through 4.16.16,  unauthenticated users can trigger database backup operations via specific admin actions, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or information disclosure. Users should update to the patched versions (5.8.21 and 4.16.17) to mitigate the issue. Craft 3 users should update to the latest Craft 4 and 5 releases, which include the fixes.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/craftcms/cms","events":[{"introduced":"04755d93f86d07cc183db47db8a0eee106892e30"},{"fixed":"8582f04f8346c6cf285a18d9704c4a2d9371e9bf"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"5.0.0-RC1"},{"fixed":"5.8.21"}]}},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/craftcms/cms","events":[{"introduced":"18263261a5a70f0f84d78db6c4449b6fe304224e"},{"fixed":"b5f17cd3246cf10034a914464964757b0b84bcd3"}],"database_specific":{"versions":[{"introduced":"3.0.0"},{"fixed":"4.16.17"}]}}],"versions":["2.6.3015","2.6.3016","2.6.3017","2.6.3018","2.6.3019","2.7.0","2.7.0-beta-2","2.7.0-beta.2","2.7.0.1","2.7.1","2.7.10","2.7.2","2.7.3","2.7.4","2.7.5","2.7.6","2.7.7","2.7.7.1","2.7.7.2","2.7.7.3","2.7.8","2.7.9","3.0.0","3.0.0.1","3.0.0.2","3.0.1","3.0.10","3.0.10.1","3.0.10.2","3.0.10.3","3.0.11","3.0.12","3.0.13","3.0.13.1","3.0.13.2","3.0.14","3.0.15","3.0.16","3.0.16.1","3.0.17","3.0.17.1","3.0.18","3.0.19","3.0.2","3.0.20","3.0.21","3.0.22","3.0.23","3.0.23.1","3.0.24","3.0.25","3.0.26","3.0.26.1","3.0.27","3.0.27.1","3.0.28","3.0.29","3.0.3","3.0.3.1","3.0.30","3.0.30.1","3.0.30.2","3.0.31","3.0.32","3.0.33","3.0.34","3.0.35","3.0.36","3.0.37","3.0.38","3.0.39","3.0.4","3.0.40","3.0.40.1","3.0.41","3.0.41.1","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","3.0.8","3.0.9","3.1.0","3.1.0-beta.1","3.1.0-beta.2","3.1.0-beta.3","3.1.0-beta.4","3.1.0-beta.5","3.1.0-beta.5.1","3.1.0-beta.6","3.1.0-beta.7","3.1.1","3.1.10","3.1.11","3.1.12","3.1.13","3.1.14","3.1.15","3.1.16","3.1.17","3.1.17.1","3.1.17.2","3.1.18","3.1.19","3.1.2","3.1.2.1","3.1.2.2","3.1.20","3.1.20.1","3.1.21","3.1.21.1","3.1.22","3.1.23","3.1.24","3.1.25","3.1.26","3.1.27","3.1.28","3.1.29","3.1.3","3.1.30","3.1.31","3.1.32","3.1.32.1","3.1.33","3.1.34","3.1.34.1","3.1.34.2","3.1.34.3","3.1.4","3.1.5","3.1.6","3.1.6.1","3.1.7","3.1.8","3.1.9","3.1.9.1","3.2.0","3.2.0-RC1","3.2.0-RC2","3.2.0-RC3","3.2.0-alpha.1","3.2.0-alpha.2","3.2.0-alpha.2.1","3.2.0-alpha.3","3.2.0-alpha.5","3.2.0-alpha.6","3.2.0-alpha.6.1","3.2.0-alpha.6.2","3.2.0-alpha.6.3","3.2.0-alpha.6.4","3.2.0-alpha.7","3.2.0-beta.1","3.2.0-beta.2","3.2.0-beta.3","3.2.1","3.2.10","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.2.4","3.2.4.1","3.2.5","3.2.5.1","3.2.6","3.2.7","3.2.8","3.2.9","3.3.0","3.3.0.1","3.3.1","3.3.1.1","3.3.1.2","3.3.10","3.3.11","3.3.12","3.3.13","3.3.14","3.3.15","3.3.16","3.3.16.1","3.3.16.2","3.3.16.3","3.3.17","3.3.18","3.3.18.1","3.3.18.2","3.3.18.3","3.3.18.4","3.3.19","3.3.2","3.3.20","3.3.20.1","3.3.3","3.3.4","3.3.4.1","3.3.5","3.3.6","3.3.7","3.3.8","3.3.9","3.4.0","3.4.0-RC1","3.4.0-RC1.1","3.4.0-RC2","3.4.0-RC3","3.4.0-beta.1","3.4.0-beta.2","3.4.0-beta.3","3.4.0-beta.4","3.4.0-beta.5","3.4.0.1","3.4.0.2","3.4.1","3.4.10","3.4.10.1","3.4.11","3.4.12","3.4.13","3.4.14","3.4.15","3.4.16","3.4.17","3.4.17.1","3.4.18","3.4.19","3.4.19.1","3.4.2","3.4.20","3.4.21","3.4.22","3.4.22.1","3.4.23","3.4.24","3.4.25","3.4.26","3.4.27","3.4.28","3.4.28.1","3.4.29","3.4.29.1","3.4.3","3.4.30","3.4.4","3.4.4.1","3.4.5","3.4.6","3.4.6.1","3.4.7","3.4.7.1","3.4.8","3.4.9","3.5.0","3.5.0-RC1","3.5.0-RC1.1","3.5.0-RC2","3.5.0-RC3","3.5.0-RC4","3.5.0-RC5","3.5.0-RC6","3.5.0-beta.1","3.5.0-beta.2","3.5.0-beta.3","3.5.1","3.5.10","3.5.10.1","3.5.11","3.5.11.1","3.5.12","3.5.12.1","3.5.13","3.5.13.1","3.5.13.2","3.5.14","3.5.15","3.5.15.1","3.5.16","3.5.17","3.5.17.1","3.5.18","3.5.19","3.5.19.1","3.5.2","3.5.3","3.5.4","3.5.5","3.5.6","3.5.7","3.5.8","3.5.9","3.6.0","3.6.0-RC1","3.6.0-RC2","3.6.0-RC2.1","3.6.0-RC3","3.6.0-RC4","3.6.0-beta.1","3.6.0-beta.1.1","3.6.0-beta.2","3.6.0.1","3.6.1","3.6.10","3.6.11","3.6.11.1","3.6.11.2","3.6.12","3.6.12.1","3.6.13","3.6.14","3.6.15","3.6.16","3.6.17","3.6.18","3.6.2","3.6.3","3.6.4","3.6.4.1","3.6.5","3.6.5.1","3.6.6","3.6.7","3.6.8","3.6.9","3.7.0","3.7.0-beta.1","3.7.0-beta.2","3.7.0-beta.3","3.7.0-beta.4","3.7.0-beta.5","3.7.0-beta.6","3.7.1","3.7.10","3.7.11","3.7.12","3.7.13","3.7.14","3.7.15","3.7.16","3.7.17","3.7.17.1","3.7.17.2","3.7.18","3.7.18.1","3.7.18.2","3.7.19","3.7.19.1","3.7.2","3.7.20","3.7.21","3.7.22","3.7.23","3.7.24","3.7.25","3.7.25.1","3.7.26","3.7.27","3.7.27.1","3.7.27.2","3.7.28","3.7.29","3.7.3","3.7.3.1","3.7.3.2","3.7.30","3.7.30.1","3.7.31","3.7.32","3.7.33","3.7.34","3.7.35","3.7.36","3.7.37","3.7.38","3.7.39","3.7.4","3.7.40","3.7.40.1","3.7.41","3.7.42","3.7.43","3.7.44","3.7.45","3.7.45.1","3.7.45.2","3.7.46","3.7.47","3.7.47.1","3.7.48","3.7.49","3.7.5","3.7.50","3.7.51","3.7.52","3.7.53","3.7.53.1","3.7.54","3.7.55","3.7.55.1","3.7.55.2","3.7.55.3","3.7.56","3.7.57","3.7.58","3.7.59","3.7.6","3.7.60","3.7.61","3.7.62","3.7.63","3.7.63.1","3.7.64","3.7.64.1","3.7.65","3.7.65.1","3.7.65.2","3.7.66","3.7.67","3.7.68","3.7.7","3.7.8","3.7.9","3.8.0","3.8.0-beta.1","3.8.0-beta.2","3.8.0-beta.3","3.8.0-beta.4","3.8.0-beta.5","3.8.0-beta.6","3.8.1","3.8.10","3.8.10.1","3.8.10.2","3.8.11","3.8.12","3.8.13","3.8.14","3.8.15","3.8.16","3.8.17","3.8.2","3.8.3","3.8.4","3.8.5","3.8.6","3.8.7","3.8.
