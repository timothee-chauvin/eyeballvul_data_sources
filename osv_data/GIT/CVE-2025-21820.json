However, if\n(as shown above) cdns_uart_console_write runs before port->sysrq is set,\nthen it will try to take the port lock anyway. This may result in a\ndeadlock.\n\nFix this by splitting sysrq handling into two parts. We use the prepare\nhelper under the port lock and defer handling until we release the lock.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"74ea66d4ca061a3cd4c0e924e51b60e924644852"},{"fixed":"e22a97700901ba5e8bf8db68056a0d50f9440cae"},{"fixed":"de5bd24197bd9ee37ec1e379a3d882bbd15c5065"},{"fixed":"8ea0e7b3d7b8f2f0fc9db491ff22a0abe120801c"},{"fixed":"9b88a7c4584ba67267a051069b8abe44fc9595b2"},{"fixed":"4410dba9807a17a93f649a9f5870ceaf30a675a3"},{"fixed":"b06f388994500297bb91be60ffaf6825ecfd2afe"}]}],"versions":["v4.10","v4.10-rc1","v4.10-rc2","v4.10-rc3","v4.10-rc4","v4.10-rc5","v4.10-rc6","v4.10-rc7","v4.10-rc8","v4.11","v4.11-rc1","v4.11-rc2","v4.11-rc3","v4.11-rc4","v4.11-rc5","v4.11-rc6","v4.11-rc7","v4.11-rc8","v4.12","v4.12-rc1","v4.12-rc2","v4.12-rc3","v4.12-rc4","v4.12-rc5","v4.12-rc6","v4.12-rc7","v4.13","v4.13-rc1","v4.13-rc2","v4.13-rc3","v4.13-rc4","v4.13-rc5","v4.13-rc6","v4.13-rc7","v4.14","v4.14-rc1","v4.14-rc2","v4.14-rc3","v4.14-rc4","v4.14-rc5","v4.14-rc6","v4.14-rc7","v4.14-rc8","v4.15","v4.15-rc1","v4.15-rc2","v4.15-rc3","v4.15-rc4","v4.15-rc5","v4.15-rc6","v4.15-rc7","v4.15-rc8","v4.15-rc9","v4.16","v4.16-rc1","v4.16-rc2","v4.16-rc3","v4.16-rc4","v4.16-rc5","v4.16-rc6","v4.16-rc7","v4.17","v4.17-rc1","v4.17-rc2","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v4.5","v4.5-rc3","v4.5-rc4","v4.5-rc5","v4.5-rc6","v4.5-rc7","v4.6","v4.6-rc1","v4.6-rc2","v4.6-rc3","v4.6-rc4","v4.6-rc5","v4.6-rc6","v4.6-rc7","v4.7","v4.7-rc1","v4.7-rc2","v4.7-rc3","v4.7-rc4","v4.7-rc5","v4.7-rc6","v4.7-rc7","v4.8","v4.8-rc1","v4.8-rc2","v4.8-rc3","v4.8-rc4","v4.8-rc5","v4.8-rc6","v4.8-rc7","v4.8-rc8","v4.9","v4.9-rc1","v4.9-rc2","v4.9-rc3","v4.9-rc4","v4.9-rc5","v4.9-rc6","v4.9-rc7","v4.9-rc8","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.100","v5.15.101","v5.15.102","v5.15.103","v5.15.104","v5.15.105","v5.15.106","v5.15.107","v5.15.108","v5.15.109","v5.15.11","v5.15.110","v5.15.111","v5.15.112","v5.15.113","v5.15.114","v5.15.115","v5.15.116","v5.15.117","v5.15.118","v5.15.119","v5.15.12","v5.15.120","v5.15.121","v5.15.122","v5.15.123","v5.15.124","v5.15.125","v5.15.126","v5.15.127","v5.15.128","v5.15.129","v5.15.13","v5.15.130","v5.15.131","v5.15.132","v5.15.133","v5.15.134","v5.15.135","v5.15.136","v5.15.137","v5.15.138","v5.15.139","v5.15.14","v5.15.140","v5.15.141","v5.15.142","v5.15.143","v5.15.144","v5.15.145","v5.15.146","v5.15.147","v5.15.148","v5.15.149","v5.15.15","v5.15.150","v5.15.151","v5.15.152","v5.15.153","v5.15.154","v5.15.155","v5.15.156","v5.15.157","v5.15.158","v5.15.159","v5.15.16","v5.15.160","v5.15.161","v5.15.162","v5.15.163","v5.15.164","v5.15.165","v5.15.166","v5.15.167","v5.15.168","v5.15.169","v5.15.17","v5.15.170","v5.15.171","v5.15.172","v5.15.173","v5.15.174","v5.15.175","v5.15.176","v5.15.177","v5.15.178","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.89","v5.15.9","v5.15.90","v5.15.91","v5.15.92","v5.15.93","v5.15.94","v5.15.95","v5.15.96","v5.15.97","v5.15.98","v5.15.99","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v
