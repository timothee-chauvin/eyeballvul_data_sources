The value 0x00 is\nreserved for undefined ID,\n```\n\nIf we add a new entity with id 0 or a duplicated ID, it will be marked\nas UVC_INVALID_ENTITY_ID.\n\nIn a previous attempt commit 3dd075fe8ebb (\"media: uvcvideo: Require\nentities to have a non-zero unique ID\"), we ignored all the invalid units,\nthis broke a lot of non-compatible cameras. Hopefully we are more lucky\nthis time.\n\nThis also prevents some syzkaller reproducers from triggering warnings due\nto a chain of entities referring to themselves. In one particular case, an\nOutput Unit is connected to an Input Unit, both with the same ID of 1. But\nwhen looking up for the source ID of the Output Unit, that same entity is\nfound instead of the input entity, which leads to such warnings.\n\nIn another case, a backward chain was considered finished as the source ID\nwas 0. Later on, that entity was found, but its pads were not valid.\n\nHere is a sample stack trace for one of those cases.\n\n[   20.650953] usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using dummy_hcd\n[
