{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2019-18684","published":"2019-11-04T16:15:11Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:36:51Z","details":"Sudo through 1.8.29 allows local users to escalate to root if they have write access to file descriptor 3 of the sudo process. This occurs because of a race condition between determining a uid, and the setresuid and openat system calls. The attacker can write \"ALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\" to /proc/#####/fd/3 at a time when Sudo is prompting for a password. NOTE: This has been disputed due to the way Linux /proc works. It has been argued that writing to /proc/#####/fd/3 would only be viable if you had permission to write to /etc/sudoers. Even with write permission to /proc/#####/fd/3, it would not help you write to /etc/sudoers","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/millert/sudo","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"6b83a6eee0bbbe654eb54d5a1fcf149ee1da173d"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-18684.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://gist.github.com/oxagast/51171aa161074188a11d96cbef884bbd"}],"database_specific":{"isDisputed":true},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
