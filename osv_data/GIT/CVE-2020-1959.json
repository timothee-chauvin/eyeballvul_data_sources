Apache Syncope uses Java Bean Validation (JSR 380) custom constraint validators. When building custom constraint violation error messages, they support different types of interpolation, including Java EL expressions. Therefore, if an attacker can inject arbitrary data in the error message template being passed, they will be able to run arbitrary Java code.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/apache/syncope","events":[{"introduced":"49c2e53ba6baf1423a89b5ab9a24aa665a5780ad"},{"fixed":"a1200e18daccb3deebcdaaf91c965596df10cab7"}]}],"versions":["syncope-2.1.0","syncope-2.1.1","syncope-2.1.2","syncope-2.1.3","syncope-2.1.4","syncope-2.1.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2020-1959.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://syncope.apache.org/security"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
