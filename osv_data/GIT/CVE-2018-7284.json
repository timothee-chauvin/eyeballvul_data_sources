{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2018-7284","published":"2018-02-22T00:29:01Z","modified":"2025-10-21T02:35:26Z","details":"A Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Asterisk through 13.19.1, 14.x through 14.7.5, and 15.x through 15.2.1, and Certified Asterisk through 13.18-cert2. When processing a SUBSCRIBE request, the res_pjsip_pubsub module stores the accepted formats present in the Accept headers of the request. This code did not limit the number of headers it processed, despite having a fixed limit of 32. If more than 32 Accept headers were present, the code would write outside of its memory and cause a crash.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk","events":[{"introduced":"d4cc63728def7ca06ad3f70547de87bc5c9ef7c0"},{"last_affected":"6a815cb3db06986dba8cda0f9f3d0d65629a1443"},{"last_affected":"719ac573a6dea452f122da76ba17073dc6ee1164"},{"last_affected":"9f9c03d928110b9636506f6bc7a8f88c5c315a71"},{"last_affected":"b7607c41e4825490ffea9d09c0b3b8f9d65f87c0"},{"last_affected":"d53653ed7a4ccb7f1dfaba6ec5543dc76e60fc53"},{"introduced":"c6d6dd133c3db3b202f1f0d457780c9a6d841e0f"},{"last_affected":"e8a1b96b5115d87b4dae0004f392193a7a48c7a7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2018-7284.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"FIX","url":"http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2018-004.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103151"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040416"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4320"},{"type":"EVIDENCE","url":"https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44184/"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}]}
