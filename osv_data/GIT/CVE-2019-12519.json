When handling the tag esi:when when ESI is enabled, Squid calls ESIExpression::Evaluate. This function uses a fixed stack buffer to hold the expression while it's being evaluated. When processing the expression, it could either evaluate the top of the stack, or add a new member to the stack. When adding a new member, there is no check to ensure that the stack won't overflow.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/squid-cache/squid","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"6cfeb300caf423ff49a0511d8bd43a56f3418273"},{"last_affected":"8a511d5e05aa17b47c7566839fd9c524512489d3"},{"last_affected":"91d32285db62332648d92eabd48c5d8e59b475d2"}]}],"versions":["BASIC_TPROXY4","BumpSslServerFirst.take01","BumpSslServerFirst.take02","BumpSslServerFirst.take03","BumpSslServerFirst.take04","BumpSslServerFirst.take05","BumpSslServerFirst.take06","BumpSslServerFirst.take07","BumpSslServerFirst.take08","BumpSslServerFirst.take09","BumpSslServerFirst.take10","HISTORIC_RELEASES","M-staged-PR161","M-staged-PR164","M-staged-PR170","M-staged-PR176","M-staged-PR179","M-staged-PR181","M-staged-PR182","M-staged-PR186","M-staged-PR189","M-staged-PR193","M-staged-PR195","M-staged-PR196","M-staged-PR198","M-staged-PR199","M-staged-PR200","M-staged-PR202","M-staged-PR206","M-staged-PR208","M-staged-PR209","M-staged-PR210","M-staged-PR218","M-staged-PR220","M-staged-PR221","M-staged-PR225","M-staged-PR227","M-staged-PR229","M-staged-PR230","M-staged-PR235","M-staged-PR237","M-staged-PR238","M-staged-PR239","M-staged-PR241","M-staged-PR242","M-staged-PR252","M-staged-PR255","M-staged-PR258","M-staged-PR264","M-staged-PR266","M-staged-PR267","M-staged-PR268","M-staged-PR274","M-staged-PR276","M-staged-PR293","M-staged-PR294","M-staged-PR295","M-staged-PR299","M-staged-PR306","M-staged-PR314","M-staged-PR319","M-staged-PR342","M-staged-PR345","M-staged-PR348","M-staged-PR351","M-staged-PR359","M-staged-PR364","M-staged-PR365","M-staged-PR366","M-staged-PR370","M-staged-PR372","M-staged-PR373","M-staged-PR375","M-staged-PR376","SQUID_3_0_PRE1","SQUID_3_0_PRE2","SQUID_3_0_PRE3","SQUID_3_0_PRE4","SQUID_3_0_PRE5","SQUID_3_0_PRE6","SQUID_3_0_PRE7","SQUID_3_0_RC1","SQUID_3_5_0_1","SQUID_3_5_0_2","SQUID_3_5_0_3","SQUID_3_5_0_4","SQUID_3_5_1","SQUID_3_5_10","SQUID_3_5_11","SQUID_3_5_12","SQUID_3_5_13","SQUID_3_5_14","SQUID_3_5_15","SQUID_3_5_16","SQUID_3_5_17","SQUID_3_5_18","SQUID_3_5_19","SQUID_3_5_2","SQUID_3_5_20","SQUID_3_5_21","SQUID_3_5_22","SQUID_3_5_23","SQUID_3_5_24","SQUID_3_5_25","SQUID_3_5_26","SQUID_3_5_27","SQUID_3_5_28","SQUID_3_5_3","SQUID_3_5_4","SQUID_3_5_5","SQUID_3_5_6","SQUID_3_5_7","SQUID_3_5_8","SQUID_3_5_9","SQUID_4_0_1","SQUID_4_0_10","SQUID_4_0_11","SQUID_4_0_12","SQUID_4_0_13","SQUID_4_0_14","SQUID_4_0_15","SQUID_4_0_16","SQUID_4_0_17","SQUID_4_0_18","SQUID_4_0_19","SQUID_4_0_2","SQUID_4_0_20","SQUID_4_0_21","SQUID_4_0_22","SQUID_4_0_23","SQUID_4_0_24","SQUID_4_0_25","SQUID_4_0_3","SQUID_4_0_4","SQUID_4_0_5","SQUID_4_0_6","SQUID_4_0_7","SQUID_4_0_8","SQUID_4_0_9","SQUID_4_1","SQUID_4_10","SQUID_4_2","SQUID_4_3","SQUID_4_4","SQUID_4_5","SQUID_4_6","SQUID_4_7","SQUID_4_8","SQUID_4_9","SQUID_5_0_1","for-libecap-v0p1","merge-candidate-3-v1","merge-candidate-3-v2","sourceformat-review-1","take00","take01","take02","take03","take04","take06","take07","take08","take09","take1","take2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2019-12519.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00018.html"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/23/1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://gitlab.com/jeriko.one/security/-/blob/master/squid/CVEs/CVE-2019-12519.txt"},{"type":"ARTICLE","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/07/msg00009.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202005-05"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210205-0006/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4356-1/"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4682"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]}
