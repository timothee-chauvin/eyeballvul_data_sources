{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2021-39201","published":"2021-09-09T22:15:09.433Z","modified":"2025-12-03T02:11:19.760344Z","aliases":["BIT-wordpress-2021-39201","BIT-wordpress-multisite-2021-39201"],"related":["GHSA-wh69-25hr-h94v"],"details":"WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. ### Impact The issue allows an authenticated but low-privileged user (like contributor/author) to execute XSS in the editor. This bypasses the restrictions imposed on users who do not have the permission to post `unfiltered_html`. ### Patches This has been patched in WordPress 5.8, and will be pushed to older versions via minor releases (automatic updates). It's strongly recommended that you keep auto-updates enabled to receive the fix. ### References https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/ https://hackerone.com/reports/1142140 ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/wordpress)","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress","events":[{"introduced":"491c67be12ca8a9fe37ae38307ba7e298c976ec3"},{"fixed":"50caeb6e61ad0c49d2c7e1d6d5115047a011f590"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-39201.json"}},{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress-develop","events":[{"introduced":"b3bf6266acd61682bc654845f621b4426645e324"},{"fixed":"4b54a6c2c9a3be775cc6dda66ed207998b068c8f"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2021-39201.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/security/advisories/GHSA-wh69-25hr-h94v"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4985"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/1142140"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}]}
