{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68301","published":"2025-12-16T15:06:19.688Z","modified":"2025-12-16T20:52:15.217415Z","summary":"net: atlantic: fix fragment overflow handling in RX path","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: atlantic: fix fragment overflow handling in RX path\n\nThe atlantic driver can receive packets with more than MAX_SKB_FRAGS (17)\nfragments when handling large multi-descriptor packets. This causes an\nout-of-bounds write in skb_add_rx_frag_netmem() leading to kernel panic.\n\nThe issue occurs because the driver doesn't check the total number of\nfragments before calling skb_add_rx_frag(). When a packet requires more\nthan MAX_SKB_FRAGS fragments, the fragment index exceeds the array bounds.\n\nFix by assuming there will be an extra frag if buff->len > AQ_CFG_RX_HDR_SIZE,\nthen all fragments are accounted for. And reusing the existing check to\nprevent the overflow earlier in the code path.\n\nThis crash occurred in production with an Aquantia AQC113 10G NIC.\n\nStack trace from production
